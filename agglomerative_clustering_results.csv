I was diagnosed with terminal cancer malignant pleural mesothelioma 18 years ago We sought out the worlds leading specialist in the disease and he saved my life I had surgery to remove my lung had heated chemo during surgery had 4 sessions of chemo and 30 sessions of radiation and it worked They told me I had 15 months to live I always say survivorship is a shitshow it certainly isnt what I expected but I am forever grateful to still be here even with all of the lasting issues due to my surgery and treatment Someone told me that gratitude and grief can exist in the same place at the same time and that really helped me to sort through all of the emotions that come with surviving cancer I just wanted to celebrate with others who understand,0,0.7003,1
As the title says I think its time I 48m have terminal carcinoma with unidentified origin It began in July with the severe night sweats It took till October to get my cancer diagnosis while my family doctor ran every test under the sun In October I checked myself into a hospital that was willing to CT and biopsy me right away My oncologist can only narrow it down to head and neck type With zero chance of cure I have 5 tumors and a few of them are over 12cm with 2 growing thru my abdomen wall Two more in my chest that have made my right arm useless and painful and the left painful to say down or sit Most of my lymph nodes in my body are cancerous and the ones between my lungs are pressing on my esophagus and lungs The ones in my neck just keep growing and its hard to swallow Ive done chemo 5 times weeks apart for the most part except for my last session which I delayed it for 6 weeks because I just couldnt face it again so soon When I do chemo it takes me two weeks or longer for the side effects to wear off and then in a few days I have to do it all over again My side effects are extremely painful Its 3 different types of chemo along with immunotherapy For 4 days after I cant eat I can barely drink fluids for at least a week I cant even get up I consider it my own living hell I just dont to suffer with it any longer My next chemo session is scheduled for tomorrow I just cant face it again Im getting so thin that my legs barely work to walk my right arm has become pretty much useless as the muscles have been eaten away so much i cant hold up a plate of food and when I flex my bicep I dont feel any of it left Just a blank spot where it used to be Im in great pain all the time with my tumors leaning on my nerves and making parts of my body numb along with never ending pins and needles which itself is quite painful I have barely the strength to even take a shit Im forced to pee in the urine container from a sitting position because I cant even lift myself from the couch or bed to stand without help I sleep 14 hours a day waking up to eat or use the bathroom I have a couple hours a day where I can sit and talk or watch tv My wife works 10 hours a day 4 days a week and I dont have much help on those days even with her working from home She has to stay accountable at work and if she gets fired her life would be ruined too I fear if i live much longer I will be a vegetable eating and shitting thru tubes To me that is not being alive And its not something I want to go thru Nor do I want my wife to have to care for a vegetable Im sharing this here because frankly besides my wife I have no one to talk about it with Shes an amazing woman who has stuck with me thru this and done anything and everything she can to help me thru this part of life I guess I just want to hear Im making the right choice That Im not letting her down by not fighting longer That Its okay to Not want to be a vegetable Because I feel like I am failing and letting her down But I think not taking this option would lead to far worse Im 48 I feel like Im leaving her early in life and that I am letting her down so badly by dying Its a strange but strong emotion of guilt Edit Thank you all for the supportive responses I have received Its way more than I ever expected Love to you all And just as a side note I sat down with my wife and had a long talk about this before making my decision as to be well informed and all options weighed The hardest decision Ive ever made but I am confident and comfortable that Im making the right choice In my own usual dark joking words I drove this meat wagon till the wheels came off And now I will sit in the yard till the grass takes over me,1,0.3875,1

I have cervical cancer with metastasis to my lungs just 5 small nodules When I found out how small and few my lung nodules were I was delighted it explained why I was so well physically and reassured me that I wasnt at deaths door or anything I know Im terminal but because Im basically fine physically I felt I was living with a terminal illness rather than actively dying Today I had a phonecall following my routine 3month scans about a week ago from my oncology nurse telling me I had cancer in my spine It was an absolute shock I asked if I was going to become paralysed and to my shock she just said yes We can try to postpone it with a single section radiotherapy which Im having on Friday It was the one thing I never considered I thought my lung nodules would probably get worse and I would go down the lung cancer path The next location my type of cancer usually spreads to is the liver and my liver is still fine The possibility of it spreading to my spine was never even considered Suddenly one phonecall and Im going to become paralysed before I die maybe even quite soon Having a panic my home isnt wheelchair friendly and I live with my elderly motherI look after her she cant look after me And who will look after her How will it happen will I gradually lose sensation or function how does it happen I feel lost Its a shock out of the blue It was lung cancer I was mentally prepared for Thats all I suppose,1,-0.9949,1
Hello My grandmother was diagnosed just this week with stage 4 lung cancer The mass is over 7 cm in the right lung It has completely cut off the right lung The pulmonologist doesnt recommend surgery as it has spread in many places So far we have found mets in the spine pelvis brain adrenal glands and a large mass in the liver The oncologist did not recommend radiation for the brain mets They took a biopsy of the liver and sent us home awaiting the results She was independent up until this point Luckily she already lives with me and my husband But now she needs assistance standing walking going to the bathroom cooking her meals doing laundry etc She is flipping back and forth between understanding how serious her condition is and insisting that she has to do things alone to recover She is definitely too weak to handle what I understand chemo would be for her I know we wont know what can be done until the biopsy results but the appointment is in three weeks and the initial estimate for her is only living weeks I guess I am just looking for what to expect and how to help her understand whats happening,1,-0.469,1
Hi all I know that when diagnosed with cancer stories about survival can be helpful Its been many years since I posted to Reddit or even looked at it But years ago I did an AMA about my diagnosis with terminal cancer I had been given two years to live approximately I have had numerous surgeries have done 7 or 8 chemos but 11 years later I am still here I was diagnosed with breast cancer that spread to liver and lungs It is HER2 one of the more rare and deadly forms However that turned out to be a good thing as a year or so after diagnosis they started to do research and came out with antiHER2 drugs Not everybody responds but I did I still go to chemo and have many of the problems that come with that Im not healthy but Im still here I went from having a 12 year old who I merely wanted to see graduate HS to watching him graduate from Caltech and get a good job in tech I saw my oldest who was 22 also get a good job married a wonderful woman and then have children My hair is grey and Im getting old Although I still look pretty young Ive lived a pretty good life and got many years that others didnt Im grateful but think about my friends who died every day But its starting to change progress is being made and others will get those years too The point is hang in there Do your treatments You never know what can happen and whats around the corner My nurses call me a miracle I dont believe in miracles but I was at the right place at the right time And I never wrote myself out You can do that too Good luck to all of you,0,0.9785,1

Hi everyone My first day here and this question has bothered me ever since my mother got diagnosed in May As most of us know receiving this diagnosis for a parent is heartbreaking and you feel so helpless My mother showed no symptoms apart from pain in her right arm upon which the doctor detected a lump in her neck and ran a biopsy This confirmed the unfortunate she had stage 3 lung adenocarcinoma non small cell which had spread to lymph nodes in her neck Weirdly she is 48 active and healthy and has never touched alcohol or cigarettes in her life But we know lung cancer does not discriminate She was administered a chemo session while we awaited her gene results and was then put on Lorlatinib ALK She showed considerable improvement in her PET scan attached below that was done after 4 months of being on this medicine She is now due for her next scan this month Im an anxious person myself and it has been so difficult to come to terms with this but am really just wondering and researching the internet all the time Is there hope Will she see me get married My younger brother get a job Is there a world where her NSCLC diagnosis becomes a chronic illness instead of a terminal one Thank you for reading love and strength to all Picture below is her 4 month checkpoint scan BELOW is MAY ABOVE is SEPTEMBER,1,0.063,1

Found myself in a really rough patch and need a moan Im very lucky that Ive finished my treatment and am currently NED but this phase is so damn hard Its a mixture of things knowing Im not actively doing something to keep the cancer away and worrying about it coming back including delayed surveillance scans But also my treatment triggered early menopause and Im on HRT Im not sure if its because Ive been on it for a few months now or because I finished my treatment or both but my hormones are going crazy The HRT helped my hot flushes and I thought I wouldnt have to deal with periods anymore but they are coming back my moods are nuts and I already had depression issues before I got diagnosed Then last night I had a dream where the cancer was back and progressed to terminal and I was dying and it really freaked me out I started back at work earlier this year and called in sick today and Im worried my manager is getting annoyed Everything just feels so hard Im already in therapy and I dont want to go on antidepressants I feel like theres nothing that helps Its so weird that somehow life seemed easier when I was going through treatment because it seemed simpler when my only goal was survive and had everything appointmens etc planned out for me,1,-0.9946,1

My Story A Journey Through Cancer In my life was irrevocably changed when I lost my wife to triplenegative breast cancera relentless aggressive form of the disease that claimed her life far too soon Watching her fight with every ounce of her strength for two years was both heartbreaking and inspiring She faced her diagnosis with courage and determination enduring countless treatments and surgeries but ultimately the cancer won Losing her left a deep void in my life a wound that I didnt think would heal Little did I know I was about to face my own battle with cancer In just a few years after my wifes passing I was diagnosed with Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor DSRCTa rare and extremely aggressive form of cancer primarily affecting my lymph nodes in the head and neck area DSRCT is a cancer that very few people know about and even fewer survive It is relentless much like the cancer that took my wife My diagnosis came with the harsh reality that my cancer is terminal Since then Ive been undergoing a grueling chemotherapy regimen called VDCIEone of the most aggressive combinations of drugs used for rare cancers like mine The chemotherapy has slowed the disease in some areas but my condition remains unstable Every day is a battle against the severe side effects of both the cancer and the treatment The pain is constant and my body feels like its breaking down under the weight of the chemotherapy My energy levels are at an alltime low and simple tasks feel monumental In recent months Ive started to experience new symptoms that have only deepened the uncertainty tightness in my chest headaches and night sweats The pain radiates from my neck down to my chest a constant reminder that the cancer is spreading At times even swallowing is difficult These symptoms are debilitating and have made me wonder how much time I truly have left The physical toll has been severe but the emotional toll has been equally overwhelming I had to leave work early in my diagnosis due to the rapid progression of the disease losing the sense of purpose I once had The activities that used to bring me joylike cooking or simply enjoying the small pleasures of lifenow feel like distant memories Each day blurs into the next with meals becoming the most significant part of my routine The highlight of my day is often just the taste of something comforting as much of what I once loved has lost its meaning My wifes passing left me grappling with grief and now Im facing my own mortality in ways I never imagined Its hard not to feel as though the cancer journey that took her life is repeating itself with me Theres a sense of cruel irony in watching her go through what I am now living Yet Ive had to come to terms with the fact that like her I have little control over what happens next Its a difficult reality to accept but Ive learned to face it headon with the same resilience she showed Despite everything I dont live in fear of whats to come After watching my wifes strength and having faced the worst of it myself Ive developed a kind of acceptance Life is fleeting and unpredictable Cancer has taken so much from memy wife my health and my futurebut I refuse to let it take my spirit Ive accepted that my journey is nearing its end but I also know that Ive lived loved and fought even when it felt impossible This story is not about seeking sympathy but about sharing the reality of what its like to live with cancer after already losing someone to it Its a brutal journey that tests everything you are but it also teaches you to appreciate what little time and comfort you have left My wife fought valiantly and now I do the sameevery day every moment until I can no longer fight Cancer has shaped my life for better or worse But Ive come to terms with the fact that I can only take each day as it comes My journey is one of loss endurance and ultimately acceptance,1,-0.9983,1

I m28 have a terminal high grade sarcoma highly aggressive spread to bones and lungs and other organs even tho chemo got my lungs free but my time is limited I probably will never get married build a house plant a tree or have children Even if it could be physically possible to have children after chemo and radiation it would not be fair to throw them into a world without a father And this just sucks my sister is infertile and the family line will end with us two The most time Im aware of these facts and can handle them but sometimes I just break down and sink into the darkness of these thoughts They overwhelm me and I cant do anything about it Who knows if I even get to know someone new who could handle my cancer and that Im going to die Who would get into a relationship with a terminal ill wreck Sexuality aside but should I sit here knowing that I will never feel intimacy or human closeness of a partner with whom I can share my pain Its so hard Im sorry for this vent sometimes my mind is going crazy over this fucking cancer,1,-0.9932,1

UPDATE I have just had a meeting with my oncologist to discuss the biopsy results of my colonoscopy It is now truly confirmed to be exactly what they had informed me it was likely to be However they have also informed me that the genomic testing of the biopsy has revealed what sub set it is Which sadly is quite an aggressive type My initial time frame given very roughly with no certainty was around years providing treatment is successful Well it has now been changed to 2 years maximum providing treatment goes perfectly More like to be months Thanks for all the kind words and responses from everyone Hi Everyone I am a 32 yr old male that is reasonably fit reasonably healthy and have had absolutely no symptons before I have just had my diagnosis of Advanced Metastatic Colon Cancer It started low in my colon and has spread to a destructive lesion in my pubic bone 8 growths in my liver 3 on my left kidney and many many smaller growths in my lymph nodes The point of making this post is just to get it off my chest to people that have either experienced it or have family members that have Without being a damn Doctor of which I have had far more than enough of in the last 2 weeks Here is my story About a month ago I started getting pain in my left hip I went to see my local GP who gave me anti inflammatories and asked me to report back in a week A week later it had gotten worse rather than improved so he referred me over to get an xray and an ultrasound done of the area They came back inconclusive The next step was an MRI of the area which did happily reveal that the prognosis he had suggested was correct a labral tear on the femur however it also incidentally found a destructive lesion in the pubic bone This set off a whirlwind of blood tests and other test after a second opinion my partner is an oncologist who forwarded the results to her consultant to get her opinion The testing required was a full blood work up with cancer markers included as well as a full body CT scan The blood work came back as completely normal except for my CA cancer marker normal is less than 40 mine returned with a result of The CT scan revealed multiple growth in different areas confirming that it had spread and that I would need a PET scan to get more definitive answers I was then fast tracked through the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre which is where my partner is currently working They organised a PET scan to happen within a few days I was also allowed to see the results about 10 minutes after the scan was concluded I was lit up like a christmas tree showing all the growths I have since spent 5 days in hospital in a pain crisis due to the lesion in my pubic bone having weakened the bone enough for it to fracture which just btw seriously sucks Whilst I was in the hospital they have also now done a Colonoscopy to get tissue samples of the Primary tumour in my colon Currently that is all I know but the conversation with my oncologist have confirmed this to be a terminal case and that systemic treatment is the only option which will only allow a small extension of life I hate it all my life was finally going in the right direction I am successfully running a small business with one of my younger brothers We are just about finishing our second full financial year and are expected to hit out first major milestone of k turnover I was also intending to ask my partner to marry me in a few months We were looking at houses to buy and are working on our first child she has reproductive issues so we are pursuing IVF Everything seemed to be going so well I guess I cant be too surprised that the universe decided to slap me back down to reality Well thats all I have to say right now I just wanted to hear some other peoples opinions on everything and to maybe get a little support in this ridiculous time of my life Cheers,0,0.7206,1
I had to put my cat down today What wed thought was arthritis turned out to be osteosarcoma and by the time the vet realized that it had spread too far When he broke the news the vet gave a hard sale on how the cat would have no quality of life and would be in immense pain for however longer he lived and said the most humane thing to do was to put him down I stood there and took it in not saying anything about my own diagnosispancreatic adenocarcinoma for sure spread to my lungs and Ill be shocked if its not also in my stomach or liver too by nowand agreed with him And as the shot did its work my cat put his paw on my fingers like he always did and closed his eyes for the last time And as sad as I was I also felt jealous for just a moment that theyll let you put a pet to sleep if theyre sick enough but a terminal patient choosing to leave on their own terms is de facto illegal and if anyone ever catches you trying theyll keep you alive out of spite Theyll also tell you how much your cats vet bill is going to be but theyll never tell you how much your treatment costs And then I had to race across town to pick my kid up from school because my Spouse changed their mind and said theyd rather not Because I dont even get to have that option even if it were legal because Im the only one who gives a shit that anyone else in my family eats or bathes And yes I know I just posted about a damn cats cancer I am aware of that More than one type of mammal is allowed to have cancer Cancer patients are allowed to have pets If any of that is something you want to report me for go ahead and do that and block me as well I have no idea how much longer I have left before Ill have to stop working I have no idea how long before some growth in me finally squeezes an artery shut or bursts one open or a coughing fit lasts so long I end up passing out Maybe Ill be lucky and die in my sleep before the pain really sets in Maybe Ill get really lucky and Ill die on a day my Spouse is actually home so my son wont starve for however long it takes Spouse to get back from fucking their latest hookup I forget if theres a point to this I dont care I killed my cat today and it doesnt fucking matter and nobody gives a damn and now I have to make up all the work I missed today because I was off killing my cat,1,-0.9975,1

Hey everyone I wanted to share my thoughts and ask for guidance on how to navigate my current situation Thought thats a good thread for since since all of us there have to deal with live changing illness Recently I was diagnosed with a rare tumora paraganglioma at the base of my skull While its not lifethreatening its location is extremely delicate The only option is surgery but due to the sensitive anatomical structures involved the tumor wont be entirely removed This means Ill have to live with it knowing its still there which is unsettling Additionally the operation will damage some of my nerves leading to facial paralysis on one side difficulty speaking and trouble swallowing On top of that Ive already lost hearing in one ear over the past few months replaced by a relentless screaming tinnitus that makes sleep nearly impossible Funny thing is that I cant even get a cochelar implant because I wouldnt be able to control the remains of the tumor with MRI due to magnets in implants I just dont know how to live with all of this Im only 23 My life was just beginning to take shape I finished my studies moved out and found quite recently a great job Now I struggle to even get out of bed Mornings are the worst because for a brief moment I hope it was all just a bad dream until my tinnitus reminds me that this is my new reality Eating and drinking feel like a challenge and most days all I can do is cry into my pillow smoke and pray for it all to end Lately Ive even started having suicidal thoughts I know that my struggle isnt the same as those with terminal cancer but for me this feels unbearable especially at such a young age Doctors were trying to cure me from having an ear infection for over 2 months when suddenly at one day I found out that I have a tumor the size of a tennis ball inside my head Can anyone tell me how to live with this How to deal with life altering permament damages to my body How do I change my way of thinking to feel close to normal again Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this Hope you find a peace also,1,-0.9856,1

Hi everyone Sorry to find you here but I do really appreciate the shared knowledge and support found in this group I F 33 was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer 11 months ago At the time I was told I would have 6 months without treatment and ideally months with chemo I have a large primary tumour in the sigmoid colon and mets to the liver 80 is tumournecrotic lungs and all through my lymph nodes so surgery is not an option My heart is also dysfunctional apparently due to being anaemic for so long and my body overcompromising Apparently my particular mutation means fewer treatment options I hear many heartening stories about people living for years with stage 4 cancer and some reaching NED status I keep asking different people on my treatment team about my prognosis and Ive never had a sunnier outcome than 2 years This includes 3 different oncology opinions on my paperwork to access my TPDlife insurance My question is why is some stage 4 cancer terminal and some curable Is it whether surgery is possible The particular mutation Size and progression of the mets All of the above I am aware this may be a dense question because to be honest I dont always understand cancer but would truly appreciate your help in making sense of things TIA,0,0.9626,1

I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer about 15 years ago Stage four because it had migrated from my esophagus to my left lung I was given treatment that was palliative in nature Ten high intensity radiation treatments and then chemotherapy The chemo made me so sick that I was admitted to the hospital for four nights and in emergency multiple times I was so sick that I signed up for assisted dying They cut back the dose to 50 and it became barely tolerable I was then found to be a good candidate for Herceptin treatments It worked so well that the cancer disappeared from my stomach and esophagus The cancer on my lung was shrinking But the cancer mutated and started growing again So here I am about to go back on chemo again and I am dreading it I am trying to stay positive but it is becoming difficult I put on a brave face for my family and friends but I am beginning to realize the reality and deal with my eventual death This is such a personal experience that it is difficult to explain to anyone what I am feeling,1,-0.9597,1

It seems to take forever on information when you are waiting on it So my wife and I sat together at our computer monitor and the oncologist went over the tumorlymphatic pathology reports Surgery

Hold on not so fast newsThe surgeon thinks the tumor was poorly differentiated and I made still need chemo because the tumor actually had burst into the intestinal tract at the Right Hepatic Flexure The oncologist says I am in a gray zone Without chemo I face a 70 chance of being cancerfree in five years With chemo that percentage increase to a 75 chance of being cancerfree in five years Of course he said I would be under continual monitoring and testing for the next five years He says at most I would receive 4 sessions of chemo over a threemonth period Hes leaving the choice of chemo up

My mom is 85 She was diagnosed with stage 4 terminal lung cancer in early May It seems to have begun sometime after February as it wasnt there when she had scans done with her pulmonologist Her comorbodities are pretty extensive Severe COPD emphysema scleroderma rheumatoid arthritis she also began having severe issues with her digestive system over a year ago that was never sorted out but she had to go completely vegetarian often had nausea and diarrhea major weightloss She also has a mix of nodes masses and lesions on her esophagus 1 I believe stomach 1 I believe large upper lung lobe tumor that went from 4x5 cm to almost 10x10cm in 3 to 4 months Plus smaller tumors in the lower lobe Nodes going across the mediastinum And I was told her heart is working at about 52 capacity Her oncologist really recommended comfort measures from day one but supported her trying immunotherapy chemo pills to see if it could buy her more time she wasnt about to take no for an answer She attempted it a total of 3 times in about 6 weeks 3 weeks stopped due to side effects 1 week stopped and restarted at a lower dose 1 more week at a lower dose then hospitalized She has now been in the hospital for 12 days 2 weeks ago she was home struggling but home using a walker She is mostly in bed other than being assisted to stand to sit on the bedside commode She sits on the edge of the bed during waking hours doing tripod breathing for air hunger They started palliative radiation last week to attempt shrinking the biggest tumor enough for some relief But she seems weaker and weaker She does have some days where she visits reads etc Others not much if any at all We are transitioning to hospice I asked the palliative dr if they could help me prepare a bit on time I live 2 states away with a 7 yr old who has her own struggles and Ive got lupus and rheumatoid arthritis flaring up all over the place due to stressbut Im flying up super often to be with her To help I was just there for 8 days and going back this Thursday The Dr said I think she at least has weeksand yet while my mom is not at all well and even declined in the 8 days I was there its hard to wrap my head around this timing as she has her wits and makes jokes very mentally well I know that no one knows But for those who have gone through a similar scenario and are ok sharing please do Also Im looking for books and resources to prepare my 7 yr old who doesnt understand that Grandma isnt getting better We arent religious but Im only finding religious resources,1,-0.2745,1

I was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma back in March of when I was 28 years old I had a large mole on my back about the size of a quarter and it was starting to change shape and darken in color So at the time I was in prison in Missouri so didnt really have choices when it came to treatment s The mole was checked out by the prisons doctor and he decided against a partial biopsy and went ahead and cut it all out right there in the prison The mole was sent out to the states pathologist and the results came back positive for Melanoma So the doctor at the prison didnt really know much about Melanoma i am guessing because when he brought me in to give me the results he attempted to stage the Melanoma and told me it would be advanced stage 4 Melanoma and they he will be contacting the states oncologist for treatment options NEEDLESS to say i went back to my cell and cried lol im tough and im not ashamed to say i cried Well when that was all out of me i got on the phone home to let me my mom in on the news and try to get some info on what Melanoma was or what i was really up against So god bless my mom she did her best to make me feel like it wasnt to serious and I was just ad worried about her as she was me but after some research I found out that Stage 4 would be terminal So now all i know is i am dying without ever have feeling sick So the states oncologist recommends i have a lymph node biopsy done So they injected some radioactive dye at the site of the mole that wad removed and hooked me up to a machine where it could see the dye flow threw my body and to which lymph nodes the cancer most likely spread to if it had in fact spread at all So with me the dye came to rest with 2 different lymph node sites both being under each arm in the arm pit area So then a biopsy was done of both lymph node sites and sent off for testing When the results came back the lymph nodes under my left arm all came back negative while the lymph nodes on my right side came back positive for melanoma So now I am officially staged at stage 3 and now im really scared to death I never knew this was spreading threw my body slowly gaining a foothold for an attack that would certainly be sooner then later So the state recommended that all the lymph nodes under my right arm be removed in case of further spread After all the lymph nodea were removed and tested they all came back negative and a blessing it was to me So now i am technically cancer free they say and need to start with these scans every 3 months or so for the next 5 years The state ordered PETCT Scans which is the most accurate and expensive scans for my condition and the first one comes back negative BLESSING Second comes back negative BLESSING Third comes back negative BLESSING Now about this time I am released from prison and no longer have insurance provided to me threw the state So i go to TMC and apply for insurance and get my medical records from the prison and to the people who need them So now I am due for my 4th PETCT Scan and believe it or not I am not able to get this scan because it coats way to much and the free insurance i receive threw the hospital wont provide this type of scan for me Believe it or not but I was provided with better medical treatment and care while I was in prison than while I am out So have to settle for a CT Scan Well the first CT scan shows some objects of interest and I am following up with that as i type this here now What i have noticed is under my right arm where my lymph nodes have been removed is a small pea size growth that is right under the surface of the skin Where it is clearly visible from across the room if i just lift up my arm So the doctor here ordered a sonogram and I guess they dont like what they saw cuz im meeting with the surgeon today to setup for a biopsy of the weird growth I am sitting here now waiting for the surgeon to come speak with me and will keep posted as i go Prayers are appreciated,1,-0.7516,1

8 weeks ago I was admitted to the hospital for back pain and they thought it was stage 2 adenocarcinoma but it has been determined to be stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma which is terminal I have been in the hospital the whole time trying to figure things out I am employed in Rhode Island and have 4 weeks left on FMLA I do not have short term disability but I do have long term disability but that can only start 26 weeks after I was first admitted LTD would start May 27 The cancer is terminal and I am in palliative care receiving radiation treatment at the hospital If FMLA ends on January 30th can I get fired before LTD kicks in on May 27th I have tried to speak with my HR group but its rats maze of robots being on hold and speaking to people who have no clue who to ask In the 8 weeks I have been hospitalized I have called nearly every day and only talked to a supervisor that helped me once I am not able to work and will likely never leave the hospital again and Im trying to remain positive but Im so worried about what will happen after FMLA ends To make matters worse I found out my FMLA leave ended on December 19th two days before my terminal cancer was discovered and I am now trying to get back on My benefits supervisor said they only mail letters and it was mailed to my house which I have not been at in 8 weeks They said the best thing to do is log in every day to confirm my status which seems like torture if Ive never left the hospital,1,-0.894,1

Ive been a part of this group for a while now but I finally decided to share my story in hopes that it reaches the right person who needs to see it I am the unicorn of cancer patients I have always lived my life knowing that I cannot control what happens to me but I can control how I react to it I grew up drinking poison water We didnt know it was poison water at the time until the chemical plant exploded and everyone developed cancer My brain tumor diagnosis came first an inoperable terminal malignant meningioma It would be followed by stage 3 triple negative breast cancer I would then also have precancerous masses removed in I would be treated successfully for the breast cancer in with no current reoccurrence of that particular breast cancer I would also be successfully treated for the brain tumor in Hawaii California would not try to treat it I have been successful in treating my original diagnosis with no evidence of either one right now However this year on routine mammograms I had 2 new primary breast cancers picked up That would make 4 primary cancers so far in my life It was caught early stage 1 I am currently on a new sevenyear treatment plan I am doing Carboplatin Taxotere and Keytruda I will be on Keytruda for a year followed by 5 years of Tamoxifen I was 37 when all of this started I had two young children and now I am 53 I expect to get a very good result after all of the treatment and hopefully get another 15 or 20 years before I need treatment again I would say acceptance is key in dealing with breast cancer I accepted a long time ago that the likelihood I would need treatment again is pretty high but ultimately that treatment would extend my life again I guess I just want to encourage everyone that even though theres no cure for breast cancer you can still live your best life possible so please dont give up I definitely had some really dark days especially after I had brain surgery but Im thankful I never gave up I got to live much longer than originally thought they said I wouldnt make it past 40 and here I am at 53 I got to meet my grandchild Please feel free to ask me anything,1,-0.644,1
I am a 21 year old woman with terminal cancer I have recently chosen to end lifelengthening treatment I will most likely be dead before I turn 22 Yes it sucks Yes its unfair Yes I desperately wish I could have more time without going through more chemo or radiation or surgeries No that is not an invitation for every crazy idiot to come out of the woodwork and suggest woowoo pseudoscience cures or try and preach their religion or spirituality at me Im sure these people mean well but it drives me absolutely crazy You are not my doctor You do not know the specifics of my case You cannot possibly provide accurate medical advice even if you were an actual medical professional and Id wager the people doing this are not actual medical professionals If turmeric or baking soda or B17 supplements were an actual cancer cure we would not have cancer and we sure as hell wouldnt be poisoning or irradiating or cutting into ourselves if we could just sleep with a crystal under our pillows instead And no there is no global conspiracy to keep people sick with cancer or kill people using cancer and no one is secretly hiding the cure for cancer And I am quite happy with my personal understanding of death and my spiritual beliefs I do not need to believe in any god or an afterlife to come to terms with my death I am in fact quite content with the idea of nothingness I like that this life was all I got even if I didnt get much of it It makes my life precious Whats the point if this was all just a blip before the real thing Why would I want this to be nothing but a test to get into the right afterlife If I have eternity in front of me then the brief 22 years on this planet wouldnt mean anything And if Im wrong then cool Im wrong But more importantly why do you care what I believe My experience of death and whatever waits beyond has no impact on you Preaching at someone who doesnt want to be preached at is nothing but selfserving It isnt helpful it isnt kind or comforting it wont change someones mind It costs you zero dollars and takes zero effort to keep your mouth shut in matters that are none of your business You do not need to insert yourself and your beliefs into someone elses journey with their own death You will not change a mind by annoying someone who is already dealing with something difficult I assure you anyone with cancer or any serious illness has heard it all before and all youre doing is reinforcing their contempt for your particular beliefs Ask permission before preaching or giving advice or better yet only give your advice to people actively seeking it It really isnt difficult to be respectful and kind,1,-0.9967,1

Im depressed I have stage 4 lung cancer at 24 and I really am not enjoying life lately Before I got diagnosed I was the type of person to work really hard towards achieving my goals and dreams with massive emphasis on long term I was the type of person to totally be down to sacrifice the enjoyment of my 20s to live good 30s and onwards Im the type of person where if I feel like Im not working towards accomplishing something then I will get depressed Well now with this disease its been stripped from me and Im just really lost at what to do I stopped my classes I dont work and I stopped running my business I have enough money for the rest of my life so finances arent an issue but now all I do all day is consume media and play video games and occasionally hang out with friends and family In theory it doesnt sound that bad but with my type of personality it gets old quite fast But unfortunately theres literally no point to working towards anything meaningful because I am going to die in a couple years so why even do it Im never going to be married or have kids Im going to spend the rest of my life just doing nothing Idk sorry if this was a hard read but I needed to rant Im sure someone here can relate,1,-0.5583,1
As all funny stories about residency begin it started in the Intensive Care Unit Im a recently promoted second year Family Med resident whos earned the privilege of becoming an ICU ordersbitch Most of the job is a mix of dataentry and the equivalent of optimizing floral designs in a funeral home on fire I mop up the charts correct sodium and magnesium and potassium and phosphate levels on future corpses and immobilize and anesthetize the rest Mr ____ needs his restraints renewed before this afternoon Mr ____ needs his pain meds renewed Mr ____ needs his diet orders advanced Mrs ___ s NG tube needs an order I loathe this rotation with every part of me Im working a 24 Friday to Saturday 7AM to 7AM The first twelve hours arent so bad The usual morning of catching up on a bakers dozen

of the Biggest Pricks Men on Campus who you go running to when the patient has the audacity to try to die on you despite your best protracted efforts So its still morning and Ive set up camp on the furthest left terminal on the lazily curving row of desk space facing the 20 or so ICU sliding glass aquariums of the rapidly dying and essentially already dead Ventilators drips and tubes galore of Frankenstein medicine buying time for some prolonging suffering for more and maybe possibly saving the life of one As a doctor who normally communicates with the living you cannot imagine how annoyed I am The day proceeds as normal these last three Godforsaken weeks Look up and notice the intensivist has already begun rounding without so much as tapping me on the shoulder because its beneath him to acknowledge me directly We see the rest of the patients Theres about 15 full minutes of teaching mostly punctuated with which you should look up the way old telegraphs were punctuated with STOP He

In I was diagnosed with stage 4 of a severely aggressive bone cancer after months of severe pain in my sacrum and left leg I was diagnosed the month before I turned 16 Ewings Sarcoma Rare and even rarer to have it where I did One big angry tumour in my sacrum wrapping around all the nerves in my leg I named her Shannon So because it was an aggressive cancer we needed to hit it with an even more aggressive chemo protocol The protocol I was under would have killed an adult but because I wasam a kid it only severely harmed me I was bedridden for the full year and a bit of treatment I did 36 radiation fractions and 11 rounds of chemo in my induction phase and then a round every three weeks for a year It was supposed to be every 2 weeks but because it was hurting my body and threatening my blood counts so much we had to add an extra week of recovery time It was the most horrible year of my life All my friends were out partying and dating and having fun and I was so sick I couldnt even go to school I was barely conscious at all A few of my friends were amazing during it all and stuck by me doing everything and anything to help the stress on me and my family They were bloody amazing and im never going to be able to repay them for making my year that bit easier Halfway through treatment I was admitted to the ICU after a few scary low blood pressure readings I basically lived in hospital all year so it wasnt much of a bother I couldnt really grasp how sick I was for those 8 days in the ICU until I overheard nurses talking about how if I hadnt have made it down there that night I would have died So a few major emergency surgeries later and another few months of treatment I made it I did it I got my NED No Evidence of Disease because theres never a certain youre cancer free with Ewings January this year Id won During my recovery I went to physio and learnt how to walk again and got stronger I even made it to school for a few days And then the pain started This time in my ribs on my right side We treated the pain for a while and then it was time for my 6 month check up scans I lit up EVERYWHERE I had a massive tumour in my spine wrapping around my spinal cord and causing the pain in my ribs There were tumours in my ankles and legs and shoulders and lungs It was official Im terminal Theres no way to stop it and Im currently on more treatment to at least slow it down and buy me some time Im dying Im in a few months Im not ready to die I cant I cant leave my family and friends behind My mum is my entire world I love her more than anything and owe her everything I have and ever will have Shes everything I could ever hope to be and Im leaving her She has to lose her daughter I cant do that to her Ive got an older sister my best friend in the world I cant leave her either We promised wed grow old together We promised wed spoil each others kids And then theres my 12 year old brother my baby Im supposed to look after him to protect him And I wont be able to do that Hes 12 for Christs sake he cant lose his sister I cant do that to him he should be worrying about not having enough vbucks on fortnite for the new skin not about how hes going to deal with everything when his older sister fucking dies And my half siblings a 6 year old sister and a 2 year old brother I love them more than anything in the entire world My sister is my best friend and Im hers She looks up to me and I cant leave her I was supposed to watch them grow up and help her sneak out when she was older I was supposed to be there to help them with homework and relationship trouble And now I cant Ill never see any of my younger siblings graduate or get their first girlfriends or boyfriends Ill never see them get married Ill never meet their kids And the worst part is that theyre all so young that theyre gonna forget me For the 12 year old hell remember me but over the years its gonna get harder and harder to remember the times weve fought or played or bickered He wont remember my mannerisms or the times wed spend hanging out in my room And the babies wont remember anything about me Thats whats breaking my heart All the games and the stories and the lullabies and the secrets gone They wont remember anything Ill just be the older sister they never knew that passed away when she was a teenager I cant leave my family behind I just cant do it Im not ready And my best friend The friend that I was planning to move out after school with The friend that has stuck by me the most The friend that was ready to carry my children because I couldnt anymore thanks to the radiation The friend that I was going to grow old with and bicker with endlessly Im not going to have her anymore And again Ill just be the friend she had when she was young that passed away I cant do this I dont want to do this But I dont have a choice My doctor said hed be surprised if I made it to the end of the year Thats 2 months 2 months to say my goodbyes and to make as many memories as I can with as many of my loved ones as I can Im not ready Please god please I just dont want to die I just needed to vent to someone anyone Im sorry Its 1am and everyones asleep and I didnt want to burden my mum by letting her know Im feeling like this right now She worries too much as it is UPDATE So Im still here as you can tell Ive been fighting like hell and it definitely hasnt been easy but Im okay Im doing well actually head wise at least Pain is under control nausea is under control and all that Jazz Ive stopped chemo because towards the end it had just stopped working altogether So for now we just zap any problematic tumours with radiation if they start causing too much pain too many problems Ive recently had a fall and really smacked my right foot So its been out of action for about a week now but im slowly recovering Ive also been on oxygen for a couple months now because my lungs just arent doing the job completely Nothing too bad as in I could technically go without the oxygens help it just wouldnt be too fun Otherwise Ive really been okay Just dont ask about my dad Ugh Lmao We all know my times coming but if the time since Ive made this post has meant anything it means I can fight a little longer as long as Ive got my family and friends behind me I appreciate all of you guys that have stuck by me and sent in your continuous support It was always crazy sweet

Hi everyone Lung cancer guy again Bad things are happening Just got home from the hospital and barely avoided being admitted thanks to a palliative NP rushing over in the middle of the night to admit me into the home hospice program I am forever grateful to her Im meeting the physician today What kinds of questions should I ask My current list of questions is Can you manage my pain after years of bupenorphine maintenance Will someone be available to help me write letters Im cut off from my family but want to make amends Will someone be with me all the time I dont want to die alone and dont have anyone to call Will I avoid terminal Restlessness and delirium That is my only fear right now I dont think I have many more questions Probably cant respond to many comments and PMs like I did last time Ill try to post an update before I die Thank you for your help Edit would also be nice to hear from others who have hospice experience Edit thank you for your kind offers of helping me transcribe letters I am not feeling strong enough tonight but perhaps tomorrow Though if things keep up at the same pace tomorrow wont be looking too good I will try to reach out if I can,0,0.7437,1
Hello all I hope this update doesnt break any rules as I suppose I do not have any questions Mods let me know I did not want to just disappear from reddit I know a number of you have been thinking about me I said I would post an update before I passed away and well here I am I know it is fast But things have been happening fast I dont mean to flood this sub with my misery Im on some heavy duty medications I hope this doesnt come off as rambling This will be my final post The Cancer is all through both sides of my chest and above my collarbone Its over I was diagnosed with Extensive Stage small cell lung cancer and given four months to live on the 6th Well it seems two weeks was a more accurate approximation of my time I am not long for this world As for what happened I wasnt slated to meet my hospice team till yesterday Friday I went to the ER on Thursday with chest pain They took a lot of fluid out of my chest The ER physician described my imaging as grotesque and immediately asked if I had considered palliation I said I didnt see hospice till tomorrow He said if I wanted any chance of dying at home I needed to see them NOW otherwise hed have to admit me He wont be getting any awards for bedside manner any time soon but I greatly appreciated his candor Several urgent phone calls later I had a palliative Nurse Practitioner in my room who went through the screening process and admitted me to their home hospice program I went home Friday morning with a hospice kit Met the palliative physician that evening shortly after I posted my list of questions here I will not see Christmas or Thanksgiving or even next weekend Every breath is work Each one more work than the last My team estimates that at this rate I will die Tuesday at the absolute latest Probably sooner Maybe tomorrow Maybe tonight My oncologist called to personally apologize for misjudging my remaining time but I hold him no ill will Determining the time of death is not an exact science I know that Im arranging to donate my body to science I want them to do an autopsy and see how it got me so quickly to help other cancer patients The oncologist thinks the cancer may have gotten to my heart or the major central blood vessels I didnt think small cell could move THIS fast but my oncologist says we caught it late My hospice team has been wonderful I have crossed tapered from bupenorphine which I discontinued Wednesday to methadone with little difficulty I have a lot of morphine and the option of hydromorphone is on the table as well if needed I am comfortable and resting at home The next stop on the train is continuous sedation and I am very tired so I probably will not be able to respond to anyone like I did last time My physician says we can start a midazolam drip as soon as tonight I will probably take him up on the offer tomorrow if Im still alive I suppose this is a good place to share where my fears around palliation come from I used to be an aid in a nursing home many years ago I saw a number of unpleasant deaths due to insufficient palliation We had a wonderful man who was prescribed a self administration pump for morphine Problem was he was too sick to press it and his physician did not seem to grasp the severity of his condition Every half hour one of us would sneak in and press the button on his pump which in hindsight was probably illegal but what else could we do He was very uncomfortable at the end I tried to do basic mouth care just before he passed and he recoiled in pain Have a heart he whispered It broke my heart to hear this admonition from such a wonderful man My greatest fear was Terminal Restlessness I saw a few patients scratch their faces and tear their fingernails out as they died even on high doses of opioids and benzodiazepines My palliative physician has assured me that he wont let that happen and that there is no limit to what they can give me I feel much reassured I have tried to write letters to the people Ive wronged I suddenly find that I want to make amends So many letters I was a functioning addict for a long time My family cut me off rightfully so So I have been writing a lot of letters But I am losing strength I will not be able to write many more letters My CNA has transcribed one letter template for everyone I hope it is enough I also had many kind offers to transcribe letters from Redditors here on the sub What love that you would do that for a stranger If I was strong enough to talk on the phone I would have taken you all up on it but I can barely talk Perhaps had I not been so stunned by my diagnosis I could have arranged this sooner But that is in the past now Dad if you somehow see this post I know how much I hurt you and and I am sorry I wish I could call you I do not even know where you live and Im not strong enough to find you I do not ask for your love for that is beyond my power to ask Just your forgiveness is enough Please Dad forgive me I do not want die without your forgiveness But I will wont I I beseech you all to make amends with those you begrudge Do not go to bed angry or hold hate in your heart You will be glad that you forgave I wish I had done so sooner before I ran out of time You will run out of time too some day in the future Dont leave any business unfinished any grudge unmended There a nicotine patch on my arm A reminder of one of the several self destructive habits that brought me here My smoking habit was not had enough to set things off this quickly but it clearly did not help For those of you who smoke I have but one message stop it Please You think you will wait till you are ready You will never be ready You say you will quit tomorrow but then tomorrow becomes today and you are never ready today only tomorrow Tomorrow never comes Today is the only day in which the decision can be made You can only quit TODAY Do so now Throw your cigarettes in the trash Do it for me What a gift it would be that my post would free you of tobaccos golden chains As difficult and shocking as these last few weeks have been I regard them as positive Only four weeks ago I thought that the universe was a cold and cruel place I experienced physical and mental abuse chronic pain and addiction But my situation has forced a change of perspective I see now that all our experiences no matter how horrid are temporary and that we will all find the same rest and peace in the end I do not mean to give the wrong impression to those struggling with depression I have tried to kill myself before The difference between then and now is vast Death is an old friend waiting to greet you at the end of a long and well lived life It can not be appreciated properly when sought in darkness I know there is no magic fix for depression but I urge you to get up go out and live the crazy wonderful irrational beautiful life you want If only I had done the same What a gift is life Thank you all for your love empathy and reassurance For all the people who PMed me offering to help with transcribing letters for all the kind messages and comments You are all beautiful people I hope you remember that No matter what anyone else says or thinks or even what you yourself think you are beautiful and can only be so because you reached out to a stranger in his moment of pain Your hearts will always carry that little light of goodness no matter how dark your days Carry that little light with you and forget it not It can brighten a strangers day It can even save the world A few PMed me asking to look into their religion In the past I would have been irritated Now I recognize that you were concerned for my souls well being Thank you for your compassion I am not well versed on religion but I have prayed and I trust that whatever higher power may dwell above the stars will look upon my situation with infinite love and compassion This in my heart I know uhugegrape you wanted to make me a plushie free of charge Your care and empathy have touched my heart Im sorry to say that I will not be in a position to receive it I did not expect to go this fast I want you to make it anyway I want you to keep it with you and know that you will always have a part of me I hope this brings you some comfort You have my everlasting love and gratitude Wishes are usually reserved for the future I have no future But I find myself still wishing I wish I had not worried so much about the little things I wish I had not worried so much about the numbers in my bank account or the punch of the time clock All that time working I had enough money to keep a roof over my head and to invest in what few hobbies I had yet I still kept racking up overtime And for what Only to find myself here It all came to nothing in the end I robbed myself of the most precious commodity I had time in exchange for green pieces of paper and little metal discs A perverse and twisted trade Only now do I see the truth I wish I had had the courage to live my life the way I wanted to I wish I had traveled the world fallen in love written a novel I wish I had had children I have no one to whom I can pass my life lessons No one to sit by my side here at the end of my world It is too late for me But it is not too late for you Live the life YOU want no matter how strange it may seem to others or to society It is your life and yours alone Live it well Im not sure where I go from here I have been reading accounts of the afterlife from various cultures Summerland Elysium Tir Na Nog Ive also taken to reading The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying though it seems I will run out of time before I can finish What a strange feeling I personally do not believe consciousness survives death but Im open to being pleasantly surprised And if not well who can complain about a siesta that cant be interrupted Regardless of what awaits me it is nice to dream And that is what I will do now I will dream I will rest and dream of the peace to come till I dream no more May you all one day face death with this same wonderful dream I do not have any friends or family to sit here with me so I am leaving this tab open I will read your comments and savor your reassurances even if I do not reply I will keep you all here with me I feel less alone this way I will keep you all with me as I die You people are all I have now I am strong but I am scared Stay with me till Im gone I do not want to be alone Till we meet again my beautiful friends Robert S Edit just woke up from my nap and Im overwhelmed by the outpouring of love Im touched by the people throwing away their cigarettes and finding the courage to pursue the life they want What a blessing you all are I am reading every message I can even if I dont respond Tears streaming down my face Now I know I will not die alone What a gift this sub has given me Edit 2 Sunday at 230 pm Haven been awake much but Ive read as much as I can How I cherish your love and kindness You helped a grumpy drug addict die with love in his heart and a smile on his face the doc will be here at 3 to give versed Im tired of trying to breath chaplain has given me last rites Its over now my friends I love you Good

After a year of fighting I am terminal I will go in Monday for aggressive immunotherapy and chemotherapy in a palliative setting Now its finally happening I find myself abandoned Ive been fighting for my children my wife she died December and myself Everything Ive been doing I have done alone Doctor visits appointments for various procedures and even the day I was told I was terminal I was alone Somehow Ive become the bad guy the guy who should go to hospice the guy whos kids via exwife are suddenly too busy to see me My vision of being surrounded by love and companionship at the end has vanished If I try to spend time with my family they are just not willing to be there I am frightening to the kids now I should just stop bothering them I get that they are frightened too They will lose their dad 13 and 15 years old still young But when I try to see them to comfort them to show them that I am still alive now and that we should make some happy memories I am rejected My exwife gets angry and mama bear about it all Its like I am the bad one We were so close before we shared 5050 custody we all got on well Now I am dying I have become some kind of irritant I am utterly alone and feeling as if I am so evil for dying I havent expressed myself well Im not usually so poor me but if I cant be sad when Im dying when can I be Why am I ostracised EDITUPDATE What an amazing group of beautiful compassionate and understanding people you all are Thank you for all of your words I read each and every one and wish I had the strength to reply individually to you all Especially those of you who are young and give me a perspective of how you feelfelt I would only écho what others have said in that be kind to yourself if you can We can only do our best I dont blame my kids for being the way they are I feel their fear and want to help work through this with them for them Daddy has suddenly revealed himself to be mortal Not the invincible hero we all were before this horrible disease struck I have taken positive steps since posting and your advice One I have tried to be kind to myself To accept what I can not change I have also taken my children and my exwife to an organisation that specialises in palliative care and who run the hospice I will inevitably become an unwilling guest of They help the patient and the families navigate this choppy water with an objective view and the knowledge they have None of us were taught this at home or at school Just like being parents was never taught except by our own parents And that is not always a great school There I had the opportunity to tell them how I felt and hear what they felt That I wanted to spend time with them That I did not want to force them to do anything they felt they were not capable of and beg them not to feel guilty for anything I just want to avoid them having regrets later in their lives because we squandered the time we have now Its easier for me I will die They have to survive with all of this They are resilient thank God and time will heal My exwife who I was very cross with when I wrote the original post is not a bad person I realise that she is just as frightened by all of this as everyone else She hasnt experienced death as I have She is reacting protectively but the meetings showed her that I am not a nightmare or threat I am a human with feelings too and I got the chance to say this in a controlled environment She only accepts what I say is true when it comes from someone else bizarrely For me it was an honour to spend the last three days of my own mothers life with her Playing her songs talking to her comatose body keeping her as comfortable as possible until she eventually passed in my arms with me telling her how much I loved her The chest that had given me food and comfort as a baby fell for the last time whilst my head was on it She was not alone I was however in my 30s Its different for my children and I get it I think the psychology meetings which will continue really did help take some of the fear from them I noticed immediately that they were more chatty and we spent some fun times flying a drone that afternoon Tough times are ahead but now we have guidance Now I have a voice I have an identity which isnt first and foremost a terminal cancer patient I am still the same I feel the same I am the same man I ever was I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for all the selfless love you have shown It really helped me overcome the madness i was engulfed in I wish each and every one of you peace and ease on whichever part of your journey you are on May your beliefs hold you steady I am also free to chat for anyone who needs help or just an ear Love is all that matters X,0,0.9981,1
77M 58 approximately lbs epilepsy since newly diagnosed brain tumor and hypertension Now on meds for seizures high blood pressure and steroids to reduce swelling from the tumor Hey guys My dad has what seems to be a terminal brain tumor and is currently living in a rehabilitationskilled nursing facility He recently developed a fever terrible productive cough was sleeping all day etc Blood test showed his WBC count is double what it should be The onsite doctor thinks its probably an infection from the woundslesions on his scalp Doctor said he could give antibiotics but that he thinks it would be better to skip antibiotics and wait for my dad to become septic and die from that He says this will be a better death than what could be further down the road he seems particularly worried about the possibility of developing pneumonia I asked isnt sepsis a painful way to die and he said no its not painful and theyll keep him comfortable with Tylenol I agreed to it but Dr Google says that sepsis IS very painful organs shutting down heart attack symptoms etc so I called the hospice line I was given the nurse said hes never heard of forgoing antibiotics for an infection even on hospice and that its worrying that this is the doctors plan I cant seem to find another doctor willing to talk for a second opinion though I just need to hear your opinions on this From your experience is sepsis painful Is this a plan that youve seen before and makes sense Would you skip the antibiotics Any information or resources would be very much appreciated Thank you Edit Thank you so so much to everyone who has responded Im so grateful that this post gained so much attention because I think I now have a better understanding of the possible experiences From what I gather from your comments it is possible to have sepsis without excruciating pain but that isnt the norm I wonder if the doctor has only ever seen those outliers and thats why he expects that my dad will only require Tylenol I asked the doctor to start him on antibiotics Hopefully I wont regret that decision but considering the information I currently have I cant purposely do that to him especially since this doctor doesnt seem worried about the very real possibility of pain Im trying to get him moved somewhere that specifically deals with patients at the end of their life but its so far been impossible because he doesnt have MediCal yet If my dad does end up with sepsis at some point Ill make sure to fight for the good pain and anxiety meds Ill be slowly responding to as many comments as I can while I deal with the chaos Just know that I truly appreciate every one of you for sharing your opinions and experiences,0,0.9413,1
I have stage 4 lymphatic metastasis rare cancer Im not terminal yet but Ive become permanently disabled I was diagnosed in About 90 of the cancer patients that have my cancer have passed away Im part of a community group with this type of rare cancer so when I searched through many of the old posts the family members would share that their loved ones had lost the fight I have 2 children and both are still schoolaged Im in my 40s Since my type of cancer can affect people of all ages sometimes I feel utterly sad that little kids were diagnosed with this and they didnt even had a chance to experience life yet I know Im living on borrowed time I got lucky that I am still alive especially with how aggressive this cancer is The thought that I have a ticking time bomb in me would cripple my mind from time to time I try not to focus on that and to just appreciate the present Unlike when I was healthy every little symptom sends me into a frenzy because it could be a sign my cancer is back Due to the rarity of this cancer theres currently no way to detect or monitor if there are if any cancerous cells that remains in my bloodstream or lymph nodes Im pretty much living in fear everyday Its mentally tiring to live this way There are many times that Ive told myself if it does come back maybe I should just give up and end this fight Even if I can get over one hurdle itll probably come back again in the future Then again what will my children think of me or say to my grandchildren in the future That mommy or grandma just decided to surrender What kind of role model would I be I love my husband tremendously and he is my rock No matter how much he loves me he would never understand the turmoil thats in me and the trauma I went through I hate to be a burden to him even though I already am I dont want to keep worrying him with my morbid thoughts and feelings My doctor prescribed me anxiety meds and I have cannabis to help me relax but these are only temporary Talking to a therapist will probably help but unless someone has personally experienced what Im going through I dont think theres any point in telling or sharing these emotions or thoughts Letting it all out here on Reddit actually makes me feel better I dont need to put on a Im okay mom wife or sister face here The only thing that keeps me going is to repeatedly telling myself let go of things you cant control If youve read it up to this point thank you for staying Vent over,1,-0.9898,1

Hi guys I was diagnosed with stage iv endometrial Carcinosarcoma last year and successfully completed 7 rounds of chemoimmunotherapy and now have a 6 week cycle for my immunotherapy Jemperli and cant stand it I thought it would be a cake walk after what I went through with chemo but this is making me itchy and uncomfortable on top of throwing up randomly and never really know when itll hit At least with chemo I was able to time out when Id feel awful and adjust accordingly but this has made it so I have skin that looks like a lizard and is all scratched up but I have to carry prochlorazine I think thats what it is around in case nausea hits Has anyone else had this issue with their immunotherapy I feel like a big baby for bringing things like this to my doc but boy I am miserable and nothing helps I take an antihistamine and it helps a little and use benedrylesque cream with aloe and it also helps but not enough What do you think theyll do for me whenif I mention it at my next appointment Im also concerned that its affecting my liver with all the itching but that could be the hypochondriac in me lol Its a common side effect but Im really hoping I wont need to go down with my dose keeping a recurrence away is the name of the game right now because I am essentially terminal Odds are itll come back its just a matter of time but I want my quality of life back I wanna go back to work I just dont see how its possible yet Please let me know Im not the only one having a rough go with immunotherapy lol thanks friends,0,0.9795,1
I started my cancer journey back in June at the age of 36 Im 41 and terminal now Its getting to the point where chemotherapy is killing me so the tumor board decided to do radiation again to give me more time Waiting on results from a recent Brian MRI pretty sure they found something because its the first time I didnt receive my results within 24 hours Im done though Im at the point of just stopping all treatments and go travel When it first spreads to my lungs I was optimistic but now Im on my 6th line of treatment and breathing is becoming a chore Ive been doing all this treatments for my kids My older kids are adults21 20 and the baby is almost 14 and were in the middle of adopting her out to my Aunt and Uncle Shes taken care of so does it make me a terrible person if I wanna just tell my oncologist to stop all treatments Radiation to the lungs doesnt sound appealing again I feel guilty and upset this is my life I was chosen to live Then again Im tired of other people telling me theyre not ready for me to go For some reason that triggers me more Im sorry MY cancer affects them but Ive told those people to go get their own cancer and dictate what they want then They stop giving me their opinions real quick I hate being mean to them but they dont understand or care to Today is Valentines Day and probably my last one months was my time frame I was given if I stopped all treatments I see other cancer patients fight so hard to live and here I am every morning when my eyes open Im like damn another day My therapist says its normal to feel this way I wish I could enjoy my life without feeling like its all for nothing How do I make myself feel like this isnt all for nothing How do I enjoy my life Im open to ideas,1,-0.9917,1
For background Im 40 and have stage 4 HER2 metastatic breast cancer which had spread to my spinal cord adrenal gland and pituitary gland I had a mastectomy to remove the primary tumor 5cm been on tamoxifen and other drugs chemotherapy for 12 weeks radiation for my brain and targeted therapychemotherapy combo every 3 weeks for the past 2 years until now Im currently taking tdm1 kadcyla Ive been on treatment for almost 4 years and will probably continue for the rest of my life Im glad to say that over time one by one the tumors disappeared First my spine got clear then today my adrenal gland Todays scan results show that only the one in my pituitary remains and it has stayed the same size for 8 months yay Im not sure if thats PCR or whatever but regardless I feel so fing amazing In sharp contrast on the first day of my diagnosis I broke down and tearfully told my then boyfriend that I was going to die And that he would have to take care of our daughter by himself and that he should find a new girl and that I wouldnt be around for much longer He stopped the car in the middle of the road and started yelling YOURE NOT GONNA DIE about a dozen times banging on the steering wheel emphatically Then he proposed and I asked are you sure in a tiny voice We got married Hes been my rock ever since Hes pushed me through every treatment cycle and been there to push protein shakes down my throat when I couldnt eat He learned to cook and actually took classes just so he could make the damn kale and spinach and broccoli taste better Hes helped me through 2am nosebleeds every single goddamn day and brought me to the emergency room at any time of the day regardless if he hasnt had any sleep Hes been there to clean up my vomit also thank you to our housekeeper Hes been there to get me sweating in the gym through the pain and pushed me to complete my first half marathon And when I got pissed at his constant reminders I get pissed a lot he kept at it anyway and pushed me even more Im healthy Im strong Ill be there for my daughters graduation Ill see her get married Ill see my grandkids he always tells me Cancer will never beat me he always says to me Im gonna live til Im 90 and well retire together he always repeats Every time I get lazy and forget my discipline hes on my ass and I hate it but he pushes me anyway Weve not been able to have any intimacy for months because of my constant bleeding but hes soldiered on regardless Ive been so bad to him fighting him every step of the way Ive been the worst patient and have never truly listened Ive always been resistant yet he never wavered Ill never be able to repay him But he says he will never need any type of repayment aside from me continuing to live life and be the best I can be Ive gone on speeches raising awareness and every time he says dont mention me at all And every time I talk to my friends about this he tells me to say its all you dont talk about me And whenever I make a post and accidentally mention my husband said he would go ballistic and yell at me to delete any mention of anything hes ever done for me So this is just my little anonymous way of thanking him coz he never allows me to mention him in any way At least here since he hates reddit he wont know and wont get mad Today Im doing dozens of different hobbies as Im pushed by my husband every day to do things to keep me positive Im getting really good at painting which has become my enduring passion throughout this journey Im joining a dance competition soon as well which has become my primary mode of exercise I love videogames I love fantasy I love life I love my family I love my daughter so much and shes been my main inspiration to keep fighting So I just wanted to write this thing sorry its so long to tell everyone here Its Possible Its Not The End Theres Hope Work Your Ass Off Now I realize that this message may rub some people the wrong way and that some cancers are tougher I know the feeling of hopelessness and the last thing you want is someone saying these words I get that Im sorry if it sounds like Im giving false hope However I was at the very bottom at one point Doctors have hammered home that stage 4 has no cure Ill be on treatment forever bar some medical miracle After radiation on my brain I couldnt recognize my family members for weeks I couldnt even remember my name The tumor in my pituitary had grown to such a size that I could barely see Right now I bleed bleed bleed every day due to my treatment My nose is a fountain and my mouth is a lake of blood every night At one point I thought about death nonstop and I felt like it too But I pushed through it and Im kicking cancers ass And Im just saying that you can do it too You may not like it like I f hate it when my husband repeats it to me nonstop but there Is Hope Phew Thats it Sorry it was so long I just hope that at least one person reads this and develops a positive attitude from it If anyone needs a chat or any advice just message me Stay strong,0,0.9069,1
I 23F was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer almost a year ago Before I was diagnosed I had very few symptoms extreme fatigue which I didnt think much of as I am a nurse and am on my feet all day and blood in my stool My PCP thought it would be best for me to have a colonoscopy even though she was sure it had something to do with my having a female reproductive system I went and had the colonoscopy and they found a tumor in my colon about the size of a golf ball I was then referred to the cancer center in my area for further testing I met with the GI surgical team before having anything looked at and was told that hopefully it hadnt spread and it would be a quick and easy surgery It was found to have spread to my liver and both lungs via the lymphatic system Since then I have gone through 6 months of chemo a bowel resection and then a left lung resection The liver was looked at before and during my bowel surgery but the Drs couldnt see anything and decided it would be best to leave it and monitor it in the future I was supposed to be entered into a clinical trial for a chemo diffused directly into the right lung this lung had more and larger mets during surgery as a way of fully clearing out the cancer I went for an MRI Saturday to make sure the liver hadnt changed as part of the criteria for this trial was stability of all other mets Today I went to see my oncologist and I received the unfortunate news that there are around 15 lesions in my liver and both lungs have growing tumors This means that it is terminal and I will have to be on chemo for the rest of my life Im honestly not sure how to feel about this I wasnt given any sort of life expectancy so I have no idea what to prepare for I feel like Im supposed to have my whole life ahead of me and now its being taken away from me and obviously I know its so much worse for kids who are diagnosed and Im grateful for the life Ive lived so far but I feel like Im allowed to be angry right now Anyways sorry for the long post but I really needed to get this out,1,-0.4593,1
Hi friends Heres a backstory Two days ago I had fevers up to 6 I kept throwing up Tylenol I called my oncologist and I went in for an office visit and was Covid flu RSV negative They sent me home after drawing a bunch of labs and monitoring my temp Yesterday at 5 am I wake up with the worst pain Ive ever had outside of surgical pain It felt like a searing knife was lodged in my left upper quadrant I took my pain meds and an edible to try and reign the pain in It progressively got worse throughout the day and became painful to take anything more than a shallow breath decided to go to the ER I explain in a cancer patient and why Im there and the nurse takes me straight back The PA comes in and its evident he hasnt read my chart I mention I was at my oncologist yesterday and they drew blood cultures etc He quite literally asked why I had an oncologist Okay maybe he was busy and thought I would be an easy case to pop in and pop out Long story short they offered IV nausea and pain meds and I gladly accepted 2 hours later the pain came back full force The nurse asks about my pain and I answered honestly I asked if I could have something for pain again because Im writhing in pain in the hospital bed Again offered both nausea and pain meds and I accepted The CT shows an enlarged spleen and progression of disease At the end of the visit the PA came back in to see me He told me that I need to get in pain management And I cant just come to the ER and ask for pain meds I explained that my home pain medication controls my normal pain very well But this wasnt my normal pain He again says I need to meet with pain management and walks out I cant help but feel they were typecasting me as a drug seeker when in reality the only thing that hurt more than this pain was my liver resection Im sorry but I have terminal cancer Im 37 How do you navigate situations like this What would you have done differently I just kind of feel disrespected and not taken seriously,1,-0.9932,1

One year ago today was the worst day of my life I had finished treatment and at my first threemonth checkup my doctors told me that they saw little tumors in my bones Until this point theyd mercifully held off on explaining that my diagnosis is terminal But when they saw the first metastases they explained that curing me was impossible and that they would only work to buy me time If they trials didnt work I would have no more than 6 months But they have worked I still have cancer more metastases growing slowly in my body I continue to feel good to have energy to feel happy In the past year Ive climbed Americas tallest sand dune entirely before breakfast sipped tea on the beaches of Sri Lanka built a pergola by hand in my own backyard and adopted a dog of my very own Ive gotten to know my friends and especially my family in a deeper more genuine sense weve all changed the things we value and hold each other much closer than we did before Ive gotten much better at knowing myself I guess my point is that I didnt know any of this was coming I didnt expect any of this change any of these blessings I didnt know how much of it would come from me Whats going to happen can be forecast but we dont really know The shadow of grief that I felt one year ago today is still there but by wrestling with it Ive become more comfortable living with it I have made space inside myself to allow it and it is accompanied by joy and selfsatisfaction What we are facing here is very difficult and Im no guru or miracle worker who can promise it will get better But the lesson Ive taken from the past year still holds true if you focus on dying you arent using your time and energy to really live So you gotta choose to do one or the other Im still going to die But I dont know when and until I go Im gonna try to live every goddamn second We dont truly know how our lives are going to go and we have to make sure some of the what if rabbit holes are good Pardon my rambling musings but its a nice day and Im gonna go sit in my back yard now Thank you for reading and I wish your time in this world to be full of meaning,0,0.9912,1
On 30th of April I quit chemotherapy And a week later I left for India I travelled till my symptoms came They came rather quickly I thought I would have more time Speed forward to beginneing of June symptoms became more serious so I started to get in touch with the hospice I opted for residential hospice meaning I leave in the hospice and I get help 24h It was my choice to be here rather than be home They already started giving me morphin which is quite surprising The other painkillers do not help me anymore I am surprised because I am still able to stand up and move without needing any help I am wondering how long I have left till I become unconscious now that I am getting morphine Doctors dont want to give me an answer Do you have any idea Any similar experience Also if you have questions I am glad to help if I can This book Nothing to fear demystifying death to live more fully by Julie McFadden has helped me understand a lot about hospice and terminal stage care Love you all,0,0.9286,1
I have posted a few times on this sub Its amazing the total lack of understanding people have in this day of modern technology where you can find the temp of a burger in London on the internet but cant be bothered to look up what Terminal means The weather here has been getting better and i was at my camp Some people i never meet before were walkinghiking and stopped for water there is a spring on my property that people get water from its been tested and its very pure and clean We were talking and asked if i would ever sell the place I said no it was going to my niece when i passed I said i would be here now that the weather is better and stop by anytime they see my truck They asked if i worked because i seemed to young to be retired I said i have cancer and now i am disabled due to being on chemo for the rest of my life and it was terminal The woman said thats terrible only having a few months to live I was like HUH Ah no i have a few years yet I will just have chemo for the rest of my life She seemed puzzled and started asking a bunch of questions Terminal does not mean you are going to die tomorrow In my case it just means they cant cure it does not mean they cant control it Some people live for years with cancer i hope i am one,1,-0.9288,1
Hey everyone The last month has been pretty overwhelming As I finish up another chemotherapy option that also hasnt worked my anxiety has been going through the roof Ive been losing my mind a little bit as Im sure a lot of you can relate BUT my beautiful partner has been working his arse off the past six months to save enough for us to go overseas together AND have another month after of time together without him having to work After six years of dating we have never had the chance to do something like this but now we do Im so excited to escape treatment and have some fun albeit it being a little risky with where Im at with treatment I know how lucky I am to have this opportunity but I just wanted to come on here and share because I know this community will understand how special this is to me I have this gut feeling that this will be our last opportunity to do something like this which is very emotional but wow Im just so bloody excited An added bonus is I get to avoid the annoying youll get through this conversations from relatives when my cancer is terminal Wins all round Anyway if you read this thanks for letting me share and listening Idk if I can sleep tonight cant wait UPDATE You guys are amazing thanks so much for the support We landed last night checked into our accom and then immediately went to a local sushi place It was awesome,0,0.9975,1
I was thinking about this and felt like sharing it Understandably lately I feel like I am constantly reminded that its ok not to be ok I understand why But we put so much emphasis on that that I hope we dont forget that its also ok TO BE OK wether you have just been diagnosed are doing treatments in remission or facing a relapse please know that its ok to still see beauty around you For example I have seen so many acts of pure love in the hospital many of them coming from nurses who truly love their job Nurses who cried with me held my hand and hugged me I have been living with cancer for 7 years I have had moments where I felt true dispair where I felt lost and scared but some of the most beautiful moments of my life not cancer related were experienced while I already had cancer Dont assume that because you have cancer you should always be miserable No You can laugh You can dance Give yourself permission to do thateven in the midst of terror Just the other day I was sitting in the oncology clinic waiting room with another girl in her 20s who also had a unilateral mastectomy like me telling her that my fake boob fell off when I bent over to tie my shoes and we were laughing so much I was crying A dear friend of mine who passed away from cancer was making cancer related jokes even in the week she died and I also have sweet memories of being with her in the waiting room laughing together Another friend of mine who lives with terminal ovarian cancer is travelling the world and telling me stories about her dates the other day she kissed a stranger she randomly met on the beach and she says she feels sexy even though she is dying arent we all Someone told me I think you are dealing too well with cancer you must be in denial Fuck off I shouldnt feel guilty for experiencing happiness even when I was getting treatments for example I shouldnt feel like there is something wrong with me for being hopeful and grateful For wanting to surround myself with people that give me hope Hope is one of the most beautiful things in our existence,0,0.9939,1

AUGUST UPDATE SCROLL DOWN I recently found out I had rectal cancer stage 4 via a pet scan I have had no symptoms and today I am going to get my biopsy I have a 2 yr old boy and a wife I love both dearly I am very big into fitness and eating healthy which is why Im in such shock when the doctor gave me the news I dont know what to expect I never been more scared in my life I keep thinking about my wife and son and it brings me to tears I am going to fight this to the bitter end This has been the hardest fee days of my life the first mistake I made was googling DO NOT DO and it just raised my feat to max level I have never cried so much in my life I feel fine I dont have any symptoms except one and its recent that its hard to use tge bathroom My doctor said that if I have lymphoma which he sees in alot of young adults that its very cureable I would like to know if this is the same doctors have to others who are in my situation or have some of you guys been able to beat tgis when its the worse case scenarioI would love to hear stories of people being in my situation and beating this dang cancers butt I am really broken right now and I just need to hear stories of other surviors and people currently in treatment on what to expect I would also like to know what questions I should be asking my doctor and what treatments I should be asking him about when they come up with my plan I apologize for my messy Grammer and paragraph Ive just been having a hard time Can anyone relate to my situation UPDATE BEGINS I went to a top cancer center in the country and they gave me the best news you could ask for in this situation Since I wrote this Reddit Post the next day i finally went to my local oncologist and he pretty much told me essentially he could give me several extra years it was devastating my wife started crying and panicking I didnt accept that as my fate so I started to talk to people in colontown and doing research on everything I could know about the top places to get treatment The 10 following 10 days were the worse 10 days ever no words can describe the fear and hopelessness I felt I just turned 36 a month prior not growing old with my wife who I have been with since she was 18 and I was 19 I always thought what life would be like when I get old with my wife grayed but still my beautiful wifeHow it would be like seeing my son grow and guiding him to manhood Then seeing my Son grown up and married bringing over my grandkids what that would be like Now I was told that wasnt going to happen asked God to guide me and give me wisdom that I make the right call as this is a actual life saving or ending decision Stay locally and enjoy the last bit of time I have left immediately discarded because Im never give up Next choice was this place in Arizona which does unique style of treatment and highly thought of and innovative cancer canter After a few days of deeply considering it I said no to thst one Felt like they sell snake oil Next was the most recommended place in my region recommended to me I said no to this one as well just something in me felt uneasy with this place didnt help my local oncologist did his residency there even though they are considered by many as the pinnacle of cancer center treatment and advancement Couldnt do it Now on to my final choicethe one I said yes to This cancer center is considered as 1B to the previous mention hospital This cancer center for whatever reason made something to the very depths of my soul scream THESE GUYS WILL SAVE YOU DUMMY Still I was on the fence mostly because it was on the other side of the country the which means leaving my beloved wife and two year old for several months potentially This is a fight for my existence I was going to do whatever it takes Then randomly out the blue I had a guy dm me from reddit or the FB groups dont remember which we start talking and we both had similar demographics the same average age sex and diagnosis Immediately after a few moments and he talks about where he got treated and immediately names the exact center I felt so strongly would save me Starts telling me he went with 2 other guys with the same demographic as us sexagegenderdiagnosis and that all 3 of them are little over 3 years NeD After hearing that my top pick got my 3 new friends NeD bout made me immediately start making arrangements to get treated at this place no matter what The trip there was a nightmare I broke my toe I missed the connecting flight Airline lost all my luggage so i had nothing other than whats in my back pack I get to a hotel at 12 am to check out at 4 am to go to the airport at 4 pm that same day I still has to drive to the hotel I booked which was the most reasonably priced and closest to the treatment facility and get booked Then arrive to my hotel and theycanceled my reservation because I was a day late to to check in They finally fixed my reservationstook a hour or so to resolve this I got to my room and I only had a 40 mins until my appointment with the new oncologist I really felt like something or someone was trying to do everything it could do to make sure I missed that appointment I swear I really felt evil forces are stopping me I sat in the room for 25mins before I had to leave and go to my oncology appointment and I sat so hopeless thinking about not going and felt that that I was just going to hear the same outcome my local oncologist gave me A death sentence My appointment was for a 90 mins with the 3 oncologist on my treatment team I told them how I stumbled upon this diagnosis BTW I dont think I mentioned in the original post that my Uncle dying suddenly at a young age from heart attack put my ass in to gear to get my heart check Heart disease is rampant in my family which is why Ive been exercising days since i was 20 So back to my appointment I finishing talking so the 1st thing my doctors said to me was that after reviewing my scans and my the entire case he said this I reviewed what everything your local oncologist records on your diagnosis treatment scans and what would be my ultimate fate They fully DISAGREEED They said with full confidence in their voices that I was going to live and that im not going to die That i was going to eliminated the cancer and the chances of reoccurence rates for the plan they laid out for me was less that 6 That very moment the doubt fear misery apathy I felt since my diagnosis all disappeared I felt my my life breath back into me and pure determination For the Doctor tell me what he said with the assurance and that I was going to be cancer free is very rare Doctors dont deal in absolutes unless they TRULY confident about your treatment outcome The doctors said that I could be treated by them from my home state I would just do telehealth visits and the new cancer team will meditate my treatment plan and my local oncologist will implement my new teams plan and do whatever they need One recommendedation I want to give before I end this is post is that whatever your diagnosis is get the opinion of a top 5 hospitaloncologistsurgeons One of the reasons the top 5 cancer centers are the cream of the crop is because their technology is far more advanced their funding is unrivaled all the top doctorssurgeons radiation Drs want to work there and do work at those places If you have been given bad newsdepressed or you just feel hopelessn dont be I have met many and i mean MSNY people with way worse diagnosis and who have been told theyre terminal some told more than that more than once Yet they didnt give up found a top cancer center or Doctor that gets them Ned and are still I want to stress this again do not play with your life or let your fate be decided by some mid level doctor or hospital,1,-0.9792,1

A relative of mine has cancer a small cell one he has depression and lives isolated he is already medicated for all that Now after decades of smoking he was diagnosed with cancer and since is pretty advance is pretty much terminal he was offered chemo with of course no warranties best case scenario the tumor is stopped for now but will come back the other option is to just care for him until the end he is still smoking eats bad dont do any exerciseis not that any of that will change and the chemo for what I saw is rough he is going to have a very bad time for what can I have some comments from people who had chemo to tell me what is like I think he should choose not to do it is sad but he quit life a long time ago,1,-0.9499,1
Im 30 and going to die soon Ive had a year to come to terms with it Here is how I rationalize it if it can be of help to anyone I was lucky to have so much time to think this over time really does help to accept the inevitable We all know its coming someday It just comes sooner for some People say Im pretty zen considering the circumstances and Id say it is an accurate assessment I certainly wouldnt be this zen if I had just learned I had cancer AND a few weeks to live at the same time I knew every step of the way my chances were very slim and my oncologists were very honest about it Im not saying its a walk in the park either I have serious pain issues Im heavily medicated and I try to beat into submission that stupid feeling of guilt for making people who love me feel sad No its not your fault you have cancer but you feel like the bearer of bad news all the time and that can take its toll I usually just tell my SO my brain is trying to make me feel guilty today and she makes it go away with a kind word and a hug Which brings me to making a small list of what helps me deal with the situation This is the internet after all and we like lists I surround myself with people who make me feel good Not all of your friends and loved ones will react well to your situation and thats ok we all have our strength and weaknesses Identify those who make you feel good when you hang out with them instead of those who will leech your energy without even meaning to Let them deal with their emotions they got plenty more time and energy to spend than you I feel blessed every day that I have the time to say goodbye instead of leaving everyone suddenly by surprise Im a young adult statistically I should die of a suicide or a sudden car crash not of cancer I feel so blessed that I have the time to plan my funeral to write letters to loved ones to say the things that matter and offer loved ones that opportunity as well I think this is much preferable to the alternative but Ive met others with terminal cancer who say they would have prefered to die instantly by surprise so maybe Im the exception Ive already been dead for a few billion years and it wasnt too bad As you can guess from this I dont believe in an afterlife at all For me dying is a return to the state I was in before my birth The year isnt very scary to me even if I did not exist The year isnt very scary to me for the same reasons Nonexistence is my standard state except for that small blimp of life I will have been blessed to experience over the universes lifespan Maybe this is a scary concept to some but it brings me comfort I accept I have absolutely no control over the progress of my illness I know some people have a need for the illusion of control but the truth is that apart from eating well sleeping sufficiently doing you chemotreatment getting a bit of exercise even if its just walking and making the effort to have a social life all of these when possible then youre already doing everything you can Give yourself a pat on the back and try to accept that things will happen whether you like it or not so try to enjoy the ride even if youre not the one driving I have little time it is precious but I must accept my energy is limited and I have the right to rest without feeling guilty I cant let the feeling that Im somehow wasting time if I Netflix and chill take over I have little time yes but I have a right to use some of that time to relax without feeling guilty My body and mind need rest and I need a sense of normality I give myself small goals and projects If I just wait passively for death then I feel like its wasted time Even if I probably just have a few weeks at most then Ill find a small project to accomplish during that time that I can realistically accomplish and be proud of In my case its writing one goodbye letter to every person I love and making a video montage for my funeral For me productive time is a happy time especially knowing it will bring joy to loved ones Ive lived making sure Id regret nothing and Im surrounded by loved ones Now this part is the one that helps me the most but It can be too late for the first part and you may have no control over the loved ones part Im lucky that my grandfather told me on his deathbed when I was 16 that when Id be dying I wouldnt regret my mistakes but instead the things I never tried but would have wanted to accomplish I took that advice to heart and applied it every day of my life Maybe its too late for you to apply that advice but it makes my incoming death a hell of a lot easier knowing I have no regrets and wouldnt change a thing in my life apart from cancer I also understand you dont control if you have a good family and you may not have had the chance to develop good friendships and Im sorry if thats the case There are support groups out there that may help you but I imagine it must be a poor substitute Having no regrets and being surrounded by loved ones is simply what helps me the most through this There I think that covers it I wish you all the best and if a single element in this list has helped someone out there then I consider this post was worth it Good luck

Hello everyone I sincerely apologise for the morbid post but I suppose given that this is a cancer subreddit youre gonna see that kinda stuff Im a 20 year old female struggling with breast cancer but I was only diagnosed about roughly 7 months ago I cant really remember anymore My cancer had been progressed to stage 3 by the time I figured out but my oncologists let me know that because Im young and healthy Ill have a good shot Well thats not really the case anymore As I mentioned I was diagnosed at stage 3 but Im on the brink of Stage 4terminal now I havent seen an ounce of progress since I started chemo and before you ask Ive tried multiple different treatments or cocktails I am feeling worse every day and I can see my fellow team at a loss of what to do Ive had a few close calls regarding death and I feel very scared that my time is up especially with being so young and I have so many dreams Everybody talks about the physical aspects of cancer nausea hair loss fatigue but never the emotional Never in my life have I been sucked into such a depressive state and its agonising watching the people around me have to witness all of this I want to make my family smile again I want to travel the world and graduate university I want to get married and I want to have kids but knowing all of that wont happen is just very upsetting I dont understand I am an incredibly healthy person and always took care of myself and everything that I do Ive never smoked never done drugs rarely ever drink and all that I just spend so much time dwelling on the why aspect of this stuff which I dont think is very healthy Im just posting this to see if anyone can relate and maybe I can reach others who are going through the same thing and we can lean on each other for some support,1,-0.9849,1

Hi guys I had my last round of chemo a week and a half ago My doctor is fairly confident I am in remission In January within 4 weeks of having symptoms I was diagnosed at 28 with primary mediastinal Bcell nonhodgkins lymphoma stage 1 which affects people from 15 to 44 and they do not know why it affects young people But I was close to stage 2 I feel like since I got diagnosed due to the REPOC regimen I went through and how strong it was I was just going through the motions My mom boyfriend and his parents really stepped up and took care of me and I will forever be indebted to them But now thats its done and everyone keeps telling Im cancer free and everything can go back to normal now But nothing feels normal anymore to me I honestly dont even know what is normal In and out of the hospital feeling like my body was giving out on me and I couldnt control it The countless amount of pain and mentally wanting to give up due do how strong my symptoms were The first three treatments not knowing if the medicine would work were so damn scary I pushed forward because 6months before I was diagnosed my 10 year old autistic nephew passed away from radiation complications and if he went through what he went through I could go through chemo Some days I feel so guilty I survived and he didnt I miss him so much and so does my family I felt guilty when I got diagnosed of us having to go through cancer again so soon after even though I knew I couldnt control it I have always been so positive and the funny one But mentally Im not doing well secretly How do you go back to normal after this Its hard accepting what I just went through and how this will always be apart of my journey I fear of getting cancer again having to go through it again or worse being terminal People think the second you finish your last round of chemo its done but its not Im still having symptoms and my doctor said it could take up to 6 months for the chemo to get out of my body I originally was going to be purchasing a house at the end of the year with my boyfriend and start a family next year But Im not sure if I can even have kids now from what Ive been told We didnt have enough time to freeze my eggs and Im slowly dying inside at that I want to be a mother so badly and I wanted to find someone who I believed was the right person If that was stolen from me by cancer I dont know how I will react Sorry this is so long I needed to rant a little I am grateful Im alive with a future ahead of me But getting diagnosed changed everything around me so much and it changed me I just want to be happy and to be adventurous carefree me again Thanks for listening,1,0.0157,1

Im just so horribly mad at this point I think a lot of my sadness is turning into anger Im so sick of having this stupid disease Im sick of people saying how horrible my disease is but also Im the only one not allowed to be upset about it all I see is posts about people dying from what I have and how hard it is for the loved ones but if I say treatment is bad people dont really care or they even say its not that bad whenever I do complain about my symptoms people tell me theyre not That bad andor that everyone goes through them Im sick of people around me even my doctors who I previously really felt cared for me seeming to genuinely think Im the crazy one for not being super happy about living for like years thats what I keep hearing sometimes people live 15 years with this well great lol Im just past 2 so in 13 more I will be 35 why do people think maybe living 15 years is something amazing or at least not something I get to massively grieve over for a while would you be happy to be told your child would best case die in years would you Not worry constantly with my disease its constant posts about 50 people dying and how tragic it is for others not the patient rarely mentioned and I am reminded that the victim is apparently everyone around me and I should be happy to live to a fraction of their age like whatever Im really gonna try to enjoy whatever I get but its hard and I am so sick and tired of people acting like me living to half my parents current age would be some happy story especially when everyone around me gets to say it as a tragedy I get people dont want to encourage a patient to be depressed and mad at the world but I constantly feel like it only matters how everyone else feels countless times Ive searched things like coping with terminal illness coping with GBM etc and half if not most of the results are for people to cope with my existence and suffering it sucks being aware of the fact that youre not the center of your suffering apparently and Im not fighting anything ffs Im not going to lose my battle I dont have great knowledge in experimenting with different diseases and dna and genes and creating new vaccines and chemotherapy a diet wont get rid of my tumor this isnt some fight Im in its something shitty that happened to me that is happening to me and I wish people sometimes would just acknowledge it instead of being so toxic positive while theyre allowed to cry about my death and suffering and whatever edit I dont really have the energy to reply to everyone atm because yeah tired lol but thank you so much for reading and ur words it really does mean something that not everyone thinks Im crazy or whatever,1,-0.9815,1
another post about it but oh well Im tired and hurting both physically and mentally first Im tired of people acting like death will be brought on by a lack of positivity and a fighting spirit its bad science I want to be happier for myself not optimistic all the time because of a pseudoscientific idea that it will cure my terminal illness and this has just been on my mind maybe its just me noticing it but I feel like lately theres been a lot of this idea that theres always a treatment option and its just not true for some of us I wish people would respect that to me being positive is telling myself that my doctors are working daily on trying to keep me alive longer some of us have had second opinions and some with third and fourth and fifth and the result will be the same of course I get helping out new patients because healthcare is a stressful meess but some of us are stage or grade 4 or have rare cancers etc and dont have a multitude of treatments available I feel a bit crazy trying to explain some people really are terminal but we are I havent given up of course I hope there will be something that works for me but I feel caught in this crazy place where I dont check for support specifically about my diagnosis because it is filled with caregivers lamenting about how horrifying it is to even watch but fear talking about it myself because people will tell me that theres actually something that can be done even if there isnt when people live ten years with what I have they get articles written about them in the local papers on the MD Anderson website I go to a good research hospital and wouldve had the same treatment there you cut it out and hope like hell it doesnt come back hope when it does you can cut it out again there are some options but the average survival is still honestly fucking terrible I am not laying down and dying because a doctor told me to I am trying to accept whats happening to me and that has been a long and painful process its been hard to be a bit graceful about it and not want to try and scream about how unfair it is all the time but believe it or not Ive made a fair amount of progress from where I used to be I just wish people would try to empathize with how much it takes to go through that mentally on top of all the physical side effects rather than discounting it with endless false hope which ends up feeling like an accusation really valium i took earlier is kicking in so idk what else sorrythanks if you read this lol,1,-0.9064,1

Has anyone else developed any new hobbies due to your cancer diagnosis My cancers are supposedly terminal and yet Ive been living pretty well over the past 18 months since I found out I quickly qualified for disability which brought me some disposable income that Ive never had before I should also say that I live with my parents since I was diagnosed so my living costs are pretty low Ive decided that I like clocks Maybe its because Im a terminal cancer patient who is obviously concerned with time Ive been buying small vintage clocks from the50s Im up to 14 clocks so I guess Im considered a collector now They are on the wall at the end of my bed and seeing them constantly makes me very happy Ive recently decided I love parrots Not the real ones but the wooden carved ones and the paper mâché painted ones that sit on a hoop I dont know why I like them other than they make me happy I have become a connoisseur of fake presson nails I have about 50 sets in a bin under my bed I the patterns and the colors they make me happy My reading appetite is voracious Sometimes Ill finish 4 books a week or more I love reading about history fictional history social justice nonfiction cancerbased books religious texts and biographies Reading definitely makes me happy I can make beaded bracelets from my ample supply of materials I love finding new combinations and designs I find that this calms my mind And makes me happy I could go on but I think you get the picture Im only doing things that makes me happy Does this make me a glutton I sort of feel like one if Im being honest But I have something inside of me that says you wont be around too much longer enjoy life as it is so that is what I do I wish I could still work Oh I loved my work But unfortunately I cant keep up with the pace I had to retire Looking back at my post I can see now that I have filled up my life as best I can with other varied activities Thank you for reading my long involved post I would love to hear if anyone can relate even a small amount I feel very lucky yes I feel lucky even with two types of terminal cancer that I am able to indulge myself these things,0,0.9983,1
Im 32 I turned 32 the month before I was diagnosed with Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue I knew I had cancer the month before I turned 32 because I did research and obsessed looked up every and any possible diagnosis for what the spot on the side of my tongue could be I delayed getting my spot looked at until the day after my birthday because I knew my life was going to change and not only did I not want that to happen I didnt want it to happen now This was going to be the year I got pregnant and had a healthy pregnancy a healthy baby a rainbow baby to make up for the loss of the two pregnancies I had last year This year was going to be the year my husband and I closed on a home This year I was finally going to get to go to New Orleans and eat real Louisianna gumbo None of that is going to happen this year Cancer happened instead I cried I yelled I threw a book and tore up a magazine I stood in my driveway and screamed at God in my small town Southern neighborhood in front of my small town Southern Neighbors Why me What the hell did I do to deserve cancer As if Im not broken enough And then I took a deep breath and sat down and strapped in to the roller coaster I came here to reddit to see if I could somehow find community in a community I still wasnt ready to admit I was a part of The Cancer Community I have come to learn so much about myself about the strength of human will and the tragedies and victories that bond a group of hundreds of thousands of people together While Im not going to say Im lucky hell none of us is you guys we have cancer I found myself in this group I am certainly blessed Youre all a bunch of bad ass warriors who are doing the most amazing things everyday Youre all fighting Youre all getting up every day doing the absolute most you can to save a life Your life Youre all freaking superpeople Were being poisoned Were being radiated Were being cut into and sewn up and made jigsaw puzzles with our own bodies But we are FIGHTING for our lives and we are doing it with everything we have in us You cant tell me that isnt some Edgy Superhero Origins story type shit The point of this post was to let you all know how amazed I am by each and every one of you No matter what stage youre in no matter what phase of treatment youre in no matter if youve been in remission or are terminal and have been told you wont be with us much longer I need you all to know that you amaze me every day with your strength your will your determination to have come this far I am proud to be a warrior alongside all of you in this battle and I look forward to celebrating your little victories and big wins as well as my own Much love to you all,0,0.9315,1
Doctors were quite unclear and due to the fast paced nature of my wifes 39 F diagnosis rushed to hospital with pain and puking to discover it wasnt her gallstone causing it as doctors had always said but a T4 tumor operated on the next morning etc Sorry if I have not given enough detail but we recently got the first PET scan results and were told the doctors were unsure if they can cure this They have suggested heavy form of Chemo for first 3 months to see if it can be shrunk They mentioned a potential operation but advised against as its very dangerous cancer is near main artery in abdomen So there advice seems to be to try shrink it via chemo to increase survival time but to not operate or intend to cure it I understand them not wanting to come out and say it blankly but we are left not knowing whether to have hope get a second opinion or start preparing for the worst Anyone else experienced this form of cancer spread or know someone who has We see a lot of survival stage 4 colon cancer stories but almost all are from people who had it spread to the liver or lungs and could be operated on without as much risk We dont know what to think given there is a potential operation but its just dangerous and possibly a last resort We also dont know if the chemo could cure her by itself I felt the doctors didnt imply this but we are not sure Thank you in advance for any advice,1,-0.9924,1
dont remember if i posted here before but Im 24 recently turned my partner is 27 He originally had bone cancer that spread to his lungs after an amputation anyway hes terminal Has been for a few months now recently the tumour grew about over of its original size hes still here but is struggling with breathing and chest pain and recently said his lips and fingers are blue aside from that no other signs One thing is though we are long distance us meeting is just not possible due to certain conditions in his country and it just pains me to know that one day he could just stop talking and i wouldnt know this horrible illness finally took him away from me This is the first man who has loved me fully and it just feels like some cruel joke that he just had to have cancer its been difficult i wish i could physically help him i really do but all i can do is be there talk to him hes got chemo in the morning i just hope he truly does live these 5 years hes been told he has left I just dont know how to cope with that the fact that one day thats it that any day could be our last i cant stop crying and i just wish things were different im sorry this isnt allowed i just need to get this out UPDATE I just wanted to update i know its been a month but He ended up with a collapsed lung he went in for that and came out Was fine for a bit you know recovering But then recently he caught a cold And it progressed to necrotizing pneumonia hes currently have an emergency surgery as we speak Im honestly quite terrified it sounds pretty bad ive googled it and theres results saying people can recover from it but idk its just insane man,1,-0.9725,1

I am a cancer survivor and it drives me absolutely crazy when people say things like God healed you and Give God the Glory for your cure Im not cured never will be or my favorite ONLY Jesus can do this Praise God No Im alive because of early diagnosis and SCIENCE Science is responsible and lets not discount my own body for healing after surgery chemo and radiation If God is so great why did I get diagnosed with cancer when my baby was 3 months old Why would an allpowerful and loving god do that The circles they go in to try and justify is mind boggling But I thank my surgeon and science for my success not God,0,0.9482,1
I was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma on this day 19 years ago It was 130 in the afternoon I still remember every detail of that 30minute appointment mostly the look of fear on my husbands face the very sorrowful look on the doctors and me thinking this was NOT how I would die They told me I would only live 15 months without intervention so I took the most extreme intervention available at the time I had my entire left lung removed but ultimately its what saved my life 19 years later Im still here living well with one lung,0,0.1415,1

Yesterday I had my first spinal radiotherapy to reduce my backchest pain from the cancer cells that were found last week in my spine I am in so much pain today ironically that I will definitely not be doing it again The pain is so bad Its so much worse than the pain I had it to relieve and although Ive been told that this pain is temporary but not how long for it is definitely not worth it With every passing moment the pain gets worse I felt I had to post just because of the ridiculousness of it This is so so much worse than the pain it is supposed to reduce I cannot believe my oncologist thought this would be worth it I feel so betrayed,1,-0.9904,1
Just wanted to post an update as I couldnt find a way of updating my original post thank you so much for all your care and responses I owe you all an update at the very least Update I called an ambulance in the end and was given enough meds to tranquilize a horse and taken to hospital Ive been on a lot of morphine since then Im still in hospital on a 24hr morphine driver Plus some steroids etc The pain had spread down to my left hip and now my left leg is gradually developing pins and needles and going numb I think in a few days I will have lost sensation to my left leg and foot completely and of course with my spinal pain not being improved I cant ditch the morphine driver and go home Theres no going home on the cards at all rn Ive been moved to a room thats not on a specific ward so my care can be handled on a palliative basis I wish wish wish I hadnt had that radiotherapy I would do anything to go back and change that I wish I had had more information and more time although even then I would probably have trusted in my oncologist and gone for it anyway tbf Their explanation at this point is that its probably a painflare reaction I dont know ifhow that explains the nerve damage to my left hipleg Or if pain flares are usually that bad or go on for so long But here I am I will openly admit Ive just been saying the cheeriest goodnights I could type to my various family members on Skype as I do every night and Im crying I really wish I could just pick up my morphine driver and go home Update 2 still in hospital back on oral Zomorph plus Pregabalin and dexamethasone pain is roughly back to normal meh unless I move around a lot as soon as I have some reassurance from my consultant that this painflare thing has passed and Im not likely to have another sudden major pain event Im going to go home that could have been tomorrow Wednesday if my consultant had been round today but she hasnt so I doubt it will be until Thursday now Thanks for all your input and love I really appreciate it at tough confusing times when Im lost and dont understand whats happening,0,0.88,1

Hello I recently became deaf in my left ear due to cancer in my necktemporal bone To be honest hearing with only one ear isnt that badsure there are tough days but its not the end of the world The thing is Ive completely given up listening to music through headphones Ive always been a music person always carrying my headphones whenever I could Sure I still listen to music in my apartment through speakers and I still game like I used tojust without headphones I tried using my right ear with them but its just so frustrating and irritating when the audio is streamed directly to only one side My guess is that I adjust more easily when the sound fills the whole room through speakers Have any of you dealt with the same issue Ive read through your posts and from what I see all of you seem to manage just fine with only one ear For me its just really hard I constantly travel on public transport and trains across my country and Ive ended up just choosing silence while reading a book Its just sad,1,-0.762,1

The first kingdom is rich and powerful filled with wealthy prosperous people the second is humbler but has its fair share of wealth and power The third kingdom is struggling and poor and barely has an army The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake as its a valuable resource to have The first kingdom sends of its finest knights clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire The second kingdom sends 50 knights with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own The third kingdom sends their one and only knight an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime with his own personal squire The night before the big battle the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night The knights in the second kingdom arent as well off but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night In the third camp the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree making a noose and hangs a pot from it He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight The next morning the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary unable to get up In place of the knights the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled only one squire was left standing the squire from the third kingdom And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides,0,0.6462,1

I have not done a cancer update for quite awhile now but I feel the time has come for another one About a year ago I underwent a second round of radiation to try to slow the growth of the cancer which was starting to resist the immunotherapy treatment that I was on It did not help Last winter I went back on chemotherapy in hopes that it would slow the cancer After four months of that it was still growing So as a last ditch attempt to get ahead of the growth I was offered this other chemo treatment that only has a chance of helping at all It came with hair loss bleeding and generally feeling like shyte for another three months in hopes of it giving me another three months I have declined this treatment I am still able to swallow most foods I realize that this is my last summer and I want to make the most of it So in leu of the treatment the oncologist is referring me to a surgeon to have a stint inserted in my esophagus at some point to allow food to pass the tumour It will be a bit of a life changer as I will not be able to lie flat or tie my own shoes otherwise everything in my stomach will make a sudden and unwelcome appearance But it should help me retain some quality of life for awhile So here is hoping that I will make it to Christmas at least I apologize if this a bit TMI but I wanted you to know what is happening Please remember to stop to enjoy the journey you dont know when it will come to an end,0,0.9651,1

In my quest to dump USAA insurance I reached out to a brokerthis was her reply Hello I hope you are doing well today I wanted to share some insights on the state of the insurance industry and the factors driving the premium adjustments you might see in your renewals this year Unfortunately this is an industrywide issue that many consumers are seeing The truth is that no matter where you live certain factors have disrupted the market leading to rising rates and difficulty finding coverage Factors leading to the disruption include Higher rebuilding costs The cost to rebuild your home is up dramatically due to the rising cost of materials and labor The supply chain for materials also continues to be an issue We can all agree that everything has gone up in price Carriers simply cant survive paying these higher prices without charging more themselves Higher vehicle repair costs The cost to repair your car is up 20 due to the rising cost of auto parts and labor to fix your car In addition parts in vehicles now include some technology features which are harder and more expensive to repair Severe auto accidents Accidents are way up postCOVID along with auto fatalities resulting in higher litigation and medical costs The good news is there are some things you can do to help you weather the current insurance market Here are a few to keep in mind Dont let your policy cancel or lapse Unfortunately carriers are not reinstating coverage as easily as they once did If your policy lapses they may require your premium in full before reinstatingor depending on the carriers risk assessment your policy could even be canceled This is across the board for every line of coverage so make sure to pay your premiums on time or in advance just to be safe Consider higher deductibles This is not a good idea for everyone but in some cases it can make sense If youre interested Im happy to discuss whether it makes sense for your specific situation Dont overlook tenure Switching companies too often can hurt you in the long run In addition some carriers wont take you as a new client if you have less than two years with a carrier or have filed a significant number of claims in the past Absorb small claims when youre able and save for catastrophic losses Claim frequency is a huge factor in your coverage rates Keep your home wellmaintained Yard debris or overhanging trees can cause premiums to increase or policies to nonrenew Regular maintenance can help prevent potential issues that might lead to insurance claims I hope this provides context for what is happening in the insurance marketplace As always reach out if you have questions or want to discuss this or other related topics,0,0.9437,1
Army veteran James Powers loses out on about 1 a month because of how the federal government calculates his veteran disability benefits Thats money that could be getting my kids into baseball or basketball or dozens of other activities that could improve our quality of life Powers said Weve got enough money to survive so Im lucky that way But after the military we shouldnt just be thinking about surviving It should be about helping veterans thrive Powers traveled from Ohio to take part in a rally outside the Capitol Tuesday in support of the Major Richard Star Act legislation that could provide a windfall of disability payouts to nearly 50 veterans More than advocates took part in the event pushing for renewed action on the long stalled bill Advocates say the money is intended to establish a more fair process for how the government handles compensation for individuals injured during their time in the ranks Our veterans cannot afford to continue losing their full earned military retirement pay because Congress insists on saving money at their expense said Tim Peters an Air Force veteran and state adjutant for the Montana Veterans of Foreign Wars Its objectively wrong The legislation has been a top priority of veterans advocates for several years and passed out of the House Armed Services Committee last summer But it has been stalled in the House and Senate since then in part because of cost concerns and in part because of general congressional inaction in recent months Named for an Army veteran who died from cancer complications in the measure deals with how veterans disability benefits are classified under federal statute Since veterans forced to retire early from the military because of injuries receive both their full military retirement pay and full disability benefits if they have a disability rating of at least 50 The combined total of the two benefits can amount to several thousand dollars each month But veterans in the same situation who have a disability rating of less than 50 are subject to dollar fordollar offsets under federal rules That means that officials subtract several hundred or several thousand dollars each month from individuals receiving the disability support leaving a gap in their income Navy veteran Bob Carey executive director of the National Defense Committee said the practice costs him a month Ive had my disability rating since So thats Ive lost over the years because the federal government says You dont need all that money he said And were the only federal employees who have our retirement reduced that way Members of The Military Coalition echoed that sentiment pledging the efforts of their 35 organizations in getting the measure passed this year Sens Jon Tester DMont and Mike Crapo RIdaho joined Rep Gus Bilirakis RFla at the rally in supporting the bill but also acknowledged that more pressure will need to be put on their colleagues to force the measure to move forward This is long past time Tester told the cheering crowd Weve got 70 cosponsors in the Senate We need to make sure leadership puts this on the floor Lawmakers said the most likely route for congressional passage is inclusion in the annual defense authorization bill currently being crafted by the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Advocates have about two months to convince members to do that If not the measure could pass as a standalone bill but congressional infighting has scuttled all but a few nonessential measures in recent months,1,-0.3831,1

Info Ive been diagnosed with MCAS by multiple drs including ND DOs MDs PAs and in there are EDS specialists rheumatologists cardiologists But purely based on symptoms and basic labs no MCAS specific labs in large part because theyve all agreed that unless youre in a flare labs do not properly pickup the MCAS maybe not the right explanation So I see an EDS specialist who knows and treats the common gaggle of issues that us zebras often end up with MCAS SIBO IC lupus rheumatoid arthritis gastroparesis Shes got me on a wonderful cocktail that keeps me functioning moderately normally with regard to eating and bigger gut issues Cromolyn sodium ketotifen Claritin Famotidine Those are the specific ones for MCAS and related symptoms Im finally going for an endoscopy this week and coloniscopy next week the gastro doesnt want to do it all at once he said it would be way too hard on me I agree Hes checking for many things including mast cells I dont want to end up being told that nothing is seen and it is because the meds are doing a decent job not perfect but pretty decent Im wondering if anyone else has stopped histamine reducing protocols before these procedures If so how many days in advance What about eating foods that kick up the MCAS or other gut issues I have to completely avoid garlic curses foiled again and can only tolerate apples and oats every so often in small amounts Ive thought of eating some the day before so my gut shows off for the dr lol Nothing causes anaphylaxis peanuts do but no way in hell I would go there Just pain gas bloating I know this may seem like a crazy idea but I have spent my life with all of the symptoms of so many things blatantly obvious yet so many drs saying things arent bad enough or based on old lab values that Im fine or for example I have both lupus and rheumatoid arthritis I waited 5 months to see a new rheum For 6 weeks leading up to the appointment I was in so much pain extreme fatigue big malar rashes bad gut flares all of it The day before my appt it all calmed down So I go to the dr tell her this but she says Im fine and dont need help Why Because I appeared fine I wasnt fine Anywaycurious on experiences,1,-0.9581,1

I am going back to my rheum in a few days and need a list of ideas and questions to ask her So a bit of history Ive dealt with so much in my 52 years Some years betterworse than others Autoimmune crud was speculated years ago but didnt show in labs However in case it adds to the puzzle that is me I had scarlet fever 3 times ages 61218 meningitis when I was 31 And have had chronic Epstein Barr since I was 33 I was diagnosed with EDS at 45 finally And all kinds of gut related issues SIBO gastroparesis gerd nausea MCAS plus IC rosacea migraines chronic fatigue Add in late diagnosis of ADHD and prone to depression and anxiety In the annoying often very painful rosacea appeared as a nasty malar rashwhich led to testing and a diagnosis of early stages lupus and rheumatoid arthritis No apparent joint damage I started on hydroxychloroquine and within 2 months the hair loss stopped pain and extreme fatigue lessened After less than a year EVERYTHING flared back up Skin pain fatigue hair loss all of it My old rheum said there was nothing else to do but I was miserable It took a long time but I got in with a new better more progressive rheum Initially my lupus labs showed that the hydroxychloroquine was helping those numbers My RA factor was still high Still no autoimmune joint damage but definite arthritis The rheum said that while my labs werent bad she said that theyre not accurate of the time and that I am clearly incredibly inflamed and need help She pointed out the ongoing lowlevel malar rash very swollen hands and fingers swollen knees and shoulders She said that I am not readydont need meds like Saphnelo or Benlysta yet She wanted to add methotrexate and folic acid to what I am already doing 4 weeks of hell 3 of those were oral doses the 4th was injection I posted about that experience last week was so much worse Despite greatly increasing the folic acid and lots of Zofran I was miserable It is not up for debate I am absolutely not taking methotrexate any more Nope So I keep hearing about the wonders of biologics for inflammation and improved life quality I am concerned that with my current labs looking fine likely due to the hydroxychloroquine and despite the rheum acknowledging my extreme inflammation I wont be offered anything to help Please share ideas on how to definitely be validated or questions to ask that would get me to lead the conversation well And unfortunately I cant do prednisone gabapentin reglan cortisone injectionsthings I have been given for different reasons and had bad reactions to If your journey sounds at all like mine what helped you,1,-0.9935,1
Ive got MCAS diagnosed several years ago For added fun I have EDS SIBO IC chronic EBV lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Ever since the roller coaster of SIBO 10 yrs ago I have struggled with my weight At first I couldnt keep weight on for anything Then in one month I gained 8 lbs and within a year 50lbs All while eating very very little I learned that I have 2 types of SIBO one causes weight loss the other to gain Add to all of that MCAS and autoimmune disease and getting my body in balance is damn hard I avoid all trigger foods that set off various symptoms No I am not on a fully low histamine diet as I spent years low histamine and low fodmap completely careful and felt awful So I just avoid foods that make me miserable Oh and I dont eat processed foods dont do much salt or sugar So I am working with an EDS dr who is also a specialist in MCAS She put me on the following protocol about 20 months ago Oral cromolyn sodium 4x daily Oral ketotifen 2x daily Claritin 3x daily Famotidine 1x daily It definitely helps the belly MCAS symptoms although I have had a lot of nausea in recent months I can say that the cromolyn sodium and ketotifen are essential for me Ive been reading that Claritin and Zyrtec can screw with your metabolism I am curious if anyone has any experience in this Partly out of curiosity Partly because before this protocol I had finally lost 8 lbs and kept it off for a few monthsthen it came back Add to it I ran out of Claritin a week ago so I started taking Zyrtec because my dr said that was fine and I am up 4 lbs and my face is puffy All to end with if you struggle to lose weight and found success what helped most I already workout get the protein I need hydrate dont eat processed foods my calories are decent avg I have worked with an amazing dr to get ALL hormones and thyroid in check So I feel its inflammation causing the issue I have no issue with being a certain number But the extra weight just doesnt feel good on my bones Plus I want to feel better overall,1,-0.0621,1

So I have cancer and have been battling it for years During the fall of I was going through chemo after already having two surgeries Everything seemed like it was going well Then in February I was told that Id need either more chemo or another surgery as they found cancer in my lungs I said Id prefer the surgery if possible They said they would get back to me Then I waited And waited And waited Until late August when I decided I had waited long enough and phoned and asked what was going on with my treatment Oh its a good thing you contacted us Well get you in for a CT scan and go from there Then I had another surgery this last November It was supposed to be two surgeries but in February they told me there was no point in the second surgery as my cancer is now terminal Ive had some time to wrap my head around it and somewhat come to terms But last night while I couldnt sleep a thought popped into my head If I wasnt forgotten about and had received treatment earlier last year would I have avoided my cancer becoming terminal And now its all I can think about Do I have a case I dont know anything about laws and legal stuff Im probably just crazy and overthinking things due to stress right Anyways I should try to at least get some sleep,1,-0.9786,1

Ive been following this game since the first time it was posted on reddit The more I saw the more I fell in love with it and then it released and absolutely lived up to all of my hype Then you released a free DLC which just added to the amazingness The DLC also heavily hinted at a sequel which is where my questionrequest comes in So my back story is Im a 31 year old guy who loves video games but unfortunately I have terminal cancer I was diagnosed when I was 27 and fought it with surgeries chemo radiation the whole works In February they told me I have about a year or two left After weeks and weeks of trying to wrap my brain around the thought of dying before I really got to do the things in life that most people want I managed to stop panicking calm down and I started to think about how I want my last years to go by and how I want people to remember me So I was wondering if you do make more Monster Sanctuary could you add me to the game as an NPC or maybe as a keeper you can fight and if you beat me I give the players an egg that they cant get anywhere else I dont know how long itll be before we see more Monster Sanctuary but I have a lot of friends that Ive convinced to play this game and theyve fallen in love with it too So itd be really cool if they could see me in the game after Im gone Anyways even if the answer is no thanks for reading my story And guys get your butts checked by a doctor You are never too young to be sure Dont end up like me,0,0.5474,1

My friend and I just moved out of an apartment unit last week I heard nothing about the damage deposit so I sent a text and they told us we wont be getting it back They said they had to spend a whole day cleaning after we left and that my cats destroyed the curtains that came with the unit which means we wont see any of the we paid I mean I wont argue about the living room curtains being damaged but the curtains in both bedrooms were untouched I had replaced mine with darker curtains when we moved in and stored the default ones in a closet and my roommate never once allowed a cat into his bedroom due to his allergies As for the cleaning how is that even calculated They didnt hire cleaners so like can they even charge us with that We cleaned the unit to roughly the state it was in when we moved in Maybe we missed some spots but its not like we left a huge mess Feels like theyre just trying to screw us over but Im obviously biased Is there anything we can do Am I allowed to ask for receipts totalling up to the,0,0.2683,1

So Im in this weird spot where Im diabetic so I want to avoid sugary drinks but my cancer is causing me to lose a lot of weight because of my lack of appetite so I was also told to avoid zero calorie drinks which is mostly what Ive been drinking I make myself smoothies that are both high in calories but low in sugar but I cant drink them 247 Sometimes I just want to open the fridge and pull out a drink that I can have immediately without cleaning a blender I thought of milk but after more than two cups milk starts to make me not feel great so I only see it as a partial solution Anyone have any drinks that are low in sugar but still pack some calories,1,-0.9735,1
Been at St Boniface for the last week turns out chemo and covid is a bad mix I swear the things I hear elders say to the people trying to treat them is absolutely horrible The man in the other bed in my room for example Spends all day yelling at nurses and complaining that they wont let him go home with a urine infection Earlier today I heard this conversation Alright heres your antibiotics I dont want any pills But then how are you supposed to get better You can take those pills and shove them up your ass Thats not very nice to say to a lady Youre no lady Then he proceeded to start swearing until she just decided to leave the room Meanwhile Im laying in bed and I feel awful for this poor person just trying to do their job Like bruh shut up and do as youre told and youll get to go home Then theres this banshee down the hall constantly switching between screaming and crying Every single waking moment all I hear is BooohoobooohoohoooAAAAAAAAAAAHHHboohoohooo as she asks for help but then starts screaming DONT FUCKING TOUCH ME like shes being waterboarded whenever a nurse tries to help her I dont know how many rooms away she is but even with our door closed I can hear all this through the god damn walls And those are just a couple examples of what Ive experienced so far and its always been patients who are 50 years old Does reaching a certain age mean you suddenly are allowed to disrespect everyone around you I swear the people who work here and deal with shit like this every day are both insane and absolute saints I try to be the perfect patient for you guys because I dont want to add on to the stress you deal with Just want them to know I appreciate them immensely Rant over,1,-0.969,1

Hey yall I figured Id ask here if anyones had the same thing happen Ive googled and so far come up with not that much relevant information Im also seeing my therapist next week so regardless of what the deal is Im getting to the bottom of it So heres the story The other day I went to dinner with my SO and we had a LOT to drink after I didnt do any other drugs and I havent for quite some time now however I am under active cancer treatment so I receive both radiation and chemo dont even know if thats relevant but anyway When we get home we get into a bit of an argument but we end it off nicely and he goes into the kitchen When he returns Im in the hallway it gets weird All I remember is a feeling of absolute dread Im scared he is gonna hurt me I remember him being extremely aggressive and screaming very hurtful things at me I start to cry a lot and I just hold my hands over my face as I dont know what to do He leaves again When he comes back I exclaim dont come near me as Im fucking scared at this point He is all confused and doesnt understand what happened He proceeds to tell me that this part about him screaming etc never happened Im so confused Ive never had anything like this happen before I go to bed completely shattered When I wake up the next morning I wonder if I maybe have had some sort of psychotic episode It was just that moment it cant have lasted more than a couple minutes but it felt like longer I dont drink every day or even more than once a week most often less I wouldnt say I have an issue with alcohol but this incident has me so scared I definitely wont be touching it for a while and absolutely not in large amounts This is something Ill talk over with my therapist as well to hear her opinion and make a game plan cus fuck that shit Its worth mentioning that Ive been in a relationship with my bf for 5 years weve lived together for 4 we have two lovely cats together and we both make decent salaries however Im on sick leave at the moment I have been a total cunt in the past when Ive gotten very drunk and I think Im starting to realize thats an actual issue I need to sort out regardless but something like this has never happened before Does any of this sound familiar to any of you Id take anything honestly because its seriously freaky EDIT I am in my late 20s Im otherwise a healthy female who eats normally only so drugs for fun far in between last time I did any was in mid December I have been depressed once in my life before but I was never medicated thats 5 years ago Never had any depressed episodes thoughts etc since then TLDR I got super drunk and imagined that my boyfriend was being absolutely horrible to me but apparently that didnt happen and I wonder if I had a psychotic episode or something,1,-0.9961,1
Hi everyone Ive had my Bengal for 7 years hes 8 Hes a neutered male I know its a common issue but I am at my wits end here he is peeing in corners on doors on the floor in the shower really anywhere but where we want him to Hes so so sneaky about it as well its like he knows hes not supposed to My partner and I have combatted this ever since we got him and we thought we finally were rid the issue as he hadnt peed inside for 2 years after we moved houses But now he has seemly recently taken up the habit once again He is not stressed theres nothing physically wrong with him multiple vet trips have proved that He gets a lot of attention play and mental stimulation I have tried pheromones lots and lots of litter boxes moving litter boxes all types of litter under the sun taking him for walks outside which seemed to actually worsen the problem We cannot let him roam free outside as we live in a big city with lots of cars and he would surely get himself killed I dont Know What To Do I am so utterly frustrated This is the number 1 source of the fights I have with my partner and its such a sore topic at this stage we can hardly even talk about it anymore I am so tired of living in the smell of cat pee the constant fear every time I hear scratch noises I dont like having people over because its embarrassing we cant go on holiday as no one can be put to watching a pissing cat I love him so much hes such a good smart little lad He is affectionate and seems happy and loving I am worried its time to consider rehoming him as we simply cant live like this anymore But I cant bear the thought of that either I am so lost Please please help I am at my wits end UPDATE I just had econsultation with my vet and we discussed some options She was understanding but also couldnt give me much advice as weve tried so much already Shes still adamant its not a physical problem as he has been vetted for this already multiple times He does not show any change or discomfort when urinating Diet is ok Anxiety meds were discussed but vet isnt convinced hes stressed or anxious Ive tried pheromones before Will try that again We were referred to a behavior specialist but hes not currently taking on private clients I am trying to find someone who can come and meet us in our home and hopefully advise us on what changes we can make to improve the situation,0,0.4349,1

Starting chemo today Two meds that I cant pronounce or remember Hoping to get approval for immunotherapy soon as well The scary part for me is that I still need to get my pet scan If it comes back that nothing spread we are throwing the kitchen sink at it then going to an aggressive surgeon oncologists exact wording If it has spread however theres nothing we can do Im ready to fight I love a good fight What scares me is there is the chance that there wont be an option to fight Half of me wants to get the pet scan and find out the other half of me wants to not know and just hold on to hope Obviously I will get the scan but damn it all hinges on that Either way I leave my house in less than an hour to start kicking the shit out of this thing LETS GO,0,0.7506,1

I bought my house in The seller replaced the heat pumpac unit completely with a Coleman unit in He purchased a ten year extended warranty but Coleman looked up the sales history of the house and voided it when they saw it was sold in Long story short this six year old unit has now died twice on me In it was one circuit board and now its the larger one Its going to cost me 2 to replace This feels like something that is going to keep happening every few years So now I am trying to decide if it is going to be worth it to replace the entire unit I was quoted at 18 but they also have a plan that covers the unit price installation all regular maintenance including filters and all repair costs both parts and labor This would run about a month over the course of ten years What would you all do Repair and hope for the best replace which I would have to finance or do their a month program Ps NEVER BUY A COLEMAN,0,0.8847,1

Ive been picking up multi ranked opposed to warzone ranked lately and Im wondering whats the skill gap like for sub vs ar Ive been using an AR almost exclusively my entire first season of ranked and Im having loads of success but Ive been kind of mind controlled by that in a way to believe I should pick up a sub In my mind Im like okay I frag like crazy with an AR I should run a sub and frag even harder but usually thats not the case Like yeah their different playstyles but its not like Im foreign to using a sub because thats 90 of what Im killing with in WZ Is the style really that different Any insights on how the roles play differently would be appreciated Lastly Im curious in regards to rankingwhat I can expect This is my first season playing any ranked in COD and Im currently crim 1 in resurgence and rank 16 plat 2 in multi But I soloq only and dont use my mic I believe I can eventually get to diamond playing the same way I am now but Im imagining crim is probably a lot sweatier and I actually need to party up and comm The reason Im not comming rn is because I simply dont know any of the call outs so I wont even be of help But how do I learn the callouts,0,0.973,1
Hitting feels quite odd because Im pretty sure maybe Im just on a hot streak and hitting a peak but at the same time I dont know if thats the case either because this is sort of how I felt after hitting I got stuck around the range for probably a month and then I finally broke into the s and I still felt quite stuck for a very long time around another month But I remember when I was in the s I would face s and get crushed but then one day I randomly peaked into and havent dropped out since and all the s that were roughly equal to me last month feel like easier wins now Now s have taken the place of s being roughly equal But the thing is is I feel like I havent even changed really much in my game and in fact I think I might actually be worse at solving puzzles than I was elo before because my puzzle rating is only but it used to be and I feel like I have actually got worse at puzzles Chess feels like a really hard game to track progress in like sure you may see your elo raise but I dont actually feel like a different player or anything When I was elo if I faced a I would just know I was cooked but now as the player thinking of facing my old self I wouldnt really feel like I have any edge IDK MAN IM IN MY HEAD Obviously Ive improved like overall Im making less blunders and more consistently decent moves but it just feels so weird to see progress but not actually be confident in my skills matching that progress Im really curious if anyone else feels the same way about this,0,0.9588,1
When I first started playing chess I was elo now Im elo 6 months later the progress Ive made can be contributed to the chess habit series by GM Aman It worked really well teaching me the fundamentals of chess and making generally acceptable moves even if they arent the best move Now I feel like Im at a point where petty much all my games are decided by whoever blunders a tactic first I am doing puzzles but apart from sharpening my board vision how do I improve I dont know what to study I dont feel like Im gaining the same value out of the chess habit series as I did previously Is there any YT series course or potentially even a book I can read that can get me to the elo range,0,0.9231,1

Im contemplating the emberlight vs the scorching bow Its quite difficult because I know I will get more usage out of the emberlight but the scorching bow also makes one specific grind quite mindless that being kril I havent done a ton of research on kril and its various methods outside of the scorching bow method that I saw So let me say I currently know the 70 bandos method with bowfa and I think I heard theres a bowfa method for kril as well but if its not as convenient as the bandos method I cba Ive seen a bit of good points for both options in other threads but I am still unsure Im close to 95 slayer so I need the hasta soon and if I dont get the bow then I will probably stop kril ASAP once I get a hasta but if I get the bow I will probably stay for all his drops But outside of the kril grind Im not aware of any other use for this bow as I already have a bowfa and I am already shredding tds with demonbane and arclight So yeah I guess Im looking for someone who has experience with the kril grind potentially with and without the bow that can maybe vouch if its worth sacrificing a synapse to make the grind easier I plan on doing my greater demon tasks at tds till 99 slayer so Im sure Ill get more than 1 synapse along the way but Im just preparing for when I get my first one and if I get shit luck following it Final point The emerberlight would help me in my cerb tasks as I still need my prims and it would convince me to start doing my abyssal demon tasks at sire which would be cool because the abyssal slayer helm is my favorite in the game so it would help achieve that goal Plus not having to charge my arclight ever would be dope,0,0.9733,1

We know we are chosen by God so Im wondering is it possible that God chooses someone to be of the elect but for whatever reason they never become saved because for example they never heard the gospel For example see 2 Timothy 210 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory Paul is saying hes okay enduring being persecuted in prison so that he can still help share the gospel to the elect so they may obtain salvation Does this mean someone may be of the elect but if they never are preached to they may die unsaved Its biblical God chooses us but we have to choose him also Romans 10 If you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved So basically is it possible there are people who are of the elect in say India or China Korea etc that are chosen by God but since they are raised in nonChristian areas they may go their entire life without hearing the Gospel and die unsaved One last question does this also mean that there is a fixed amount of us elected in the history of life I could be wrong but I remember hearing that all who are meant to be saved must be saved before something big happens like Christ coming back or something like that idk It may be somewhere in revelation but I cant find it Does anyone know what Im referring to,0,0.9832,1
I started playing chess 9 months ago and I started playing blitz at elo and I dropped to Then I grinded to and couldnt climb past that point after about a month of playing chess Then I switched to rapid and climbed to in rapid in 1 day then it took me about a week or two to get past elo Then about weeks in rapid Then I struggled was the hardest elo I ever had to improve out of then was not as hard as the previous but still hard then elo was extremely easy And now Im ish and I think Im underrated I just havent been playing much rated lately mostly unrated to refine my openings and just simply not playing a lot of chess Yet every time I play I feel like I have improved since last time I played which makes no sense because Im not even doing puzzles I almost feel like the shackles have loosened and Im playing less static chess and more dynamic chess where I will make moves like using pawn trades to improve my minor pieces activity or trading my weaker minors for their stronger more active minors Im not rushing to win games Im fine playing 50 moves to grind out a win through positional play etc But these are all concepts I learnt through watching higher rated players but never knew how to actually execute but now I feel like its coming quite natural and I dont even really need to try to improve Which makes no sense when I was I put in so many hours watching videos playing games grinding puzzles yet saw little to no improvement and then randomly things just click and now I feel like I could push if I wanted to quite easily What are your guys thoughts Im interested to hear some high rated players and see if maybe they had a similar experience Im just puzzled by this its like Im putting in the least amount of effort in my chess climb yet playing the best chess of my life,0,0.997,1
I play the vienna as white and have a 66wr on it but as black I have a recent winrate of in the last 20 games as black I feel like Ive tried so many openings as black and I cant really find one that I like a lot I find it much easier to play against 1 e4 than 1 d4 Against d4 Ive tried the dutch the pirckings indian QGD Anti london setup the modern etc I think I like the dutch the most against d4 as it feels like it gives me more of a volatile game as black and sort of forces them to play my game which I like In theory my dream would be to learn and get good at the caro against e4 then learn the dutch to a greater degree but Im still wondering if theres something better out there for me Black just feels so much worse to play than white I like to attack fast and Im decent at attacking for my level which is why my wr is so high on the vienna but I cant seem to get that same playstyle playing as black,0,0.9851,1

Hello I am Matthew and as the title says Im a disabled stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer patient with a barely functioning AC Back in near October me and my sister bought our 1st house We had a inspector go thru and said all was good and our realtor sold us on a home warranty and we specifically asked if it would cover the AC if there ever was a problem and of course she said yes Now fast forward to February of i got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer and had to go thru chemo for 6 months so i ended up becoming disabled and unable tl ever return to work due to the amount of damage my body took During that time summer came and we noticed the AC wasnt cooling the house down at all So we called the home warranty and they sent out a tech from a company who defrosted our coils in the furnace room Well that didnt help at all So we had called again and they sent out another tech who said the compressor is not holding pressure and told us it needs to be completely replaced especially since it was under the old refrigerant thats been phased out house was built in 82 Well time passes and Im just misrable in my house with it being over 80F and still doing chemo so i reached out to our home warranty and they told me we are not going tl replace it because of abnormal circumstances which at this point i was too weak to pursue any further and so all i could so was just cancel my warranty So here we are 2 years later and still having the same issue I dont have good credit at all due to everything thats happened to me and with summer starting here in NW Indiana i honestly dont know what to do and overall just feel defeated and helpless We did get 2 portable units since we have sliding windows and those just barely helped at all I am on SS Disability but i mean most of it is eaten up by my mortgage which i am sure many of you can understand So if anyone has any help or advice on what we can do Im all ears and i do appreciate anyone who is reading this and is trying to help I just want me and my sister to be comfortable especially since shes done alot to help take care of me If it helps my unit is a Lennox elite series,0,0.9703,1

Today exactly 2 years ago at my final treatment of chemo my oncologist announced to me that I was in complete remission Stage 4 Pancreatic And Liver cancer 2 years 2 whole flipping years Im being maintained with chemo pills that I will have to take for the rest of my life however that may be sincewellmy oncologist has never given me a expiration date In her words you could walk outside get hit by a car and die Idk if and when you will pass but you need to live your life to your fullest And even tho I have my paranoia Im grateful to know I could live a long and somewhat comfortable life I am 33 now and all this happened right before I turned 31 in Ill never forget that pain that made me finally goto the ER My oncologist did clarify me as fully disabled and could no longer work due to the face Ill be stage 4 for the rest of my life and that there is always the possibility of it returning but until thenI am ordered to live My mom has been encouraging me to maybe contact the Cancer Society and be a motivational speaker so that I can hopefully help others who are scared and alone because not everyone gets to have a support team and that is truly unacceptable Im justscared of being told No But anyway in the great words of Joshua Graham the fire inside me burned Brighter than the fire around me and it was their love In the end there is always light in the darkness If you ever came across a Joshua Graham quote video and saw the YouTuber name drhomer38 das me No Im not a Dr it was just a cringy name from my younger days this video Anyway Have an awesome day and lets clog cancers toilet together,0,0.8542,1

Hello I have been a huge fan STALKER since I found out about the series a few years ago from YouTube channels such as Warlockracy GmanLives and Salt Factory and of course thanks to the mini series Chernobyl and I actually did work in a nuclear pharmacy as a courier and dispatcher disposal and quality control To say games like this and fallout facinate me is well an understatement lol Anyway I started playing SOC bout a year or 2 ago on PC andwell I gave up and got frustrated I did keep giving it more tries but I unfortunately suck at the games unless I turned the difficulty down or watched more gameplay videos Then when the Legends Of The Zone released I immediately got it for my XSX and it was much more of an enjoyable experience even though I havent finished it or anything but the game is so much fun And not to mention the lore I absolutely love the ingame universe Then STALKER 2 comes out and I again get it in XSX andwell I tried playing on Veteran and well i wasnt having funI ended up having to turn the difficulty down to Recruit because I was constantly struggling and dying even with all the patches we have now and I kept blowing thru ammo and medkits I do unfortunately have the bad habit of wanting to just go in guns blazing which I understand is usually a bad idea But Anyway Ive been enjoying the game way more on the Recruit difficulty and even have been getting thru the story which I absolutely love it Butam I really enjoying it or am I just a poser since Im only playing on easy I know it sounds silly but I am still kinda new to all this Lastly I wanna share something very important to me about the series You see Ima cancer patient Terminal to be specific Stage 4 pancreatic and liver Diagnosed in February of And Firelakes Dirge For The Planet played when I was first admitted to the hospital and was the song that I cried almost every tear out of my body because of the pain I was in BTW it was the cover done by Alina Gingertail which her voice just chefs kiss but yeah that song holds a special place as a reminder of the pain and hell I went thru with being diagnosed going thru 12 rounds of hell with chemo and eventually making it into remission But unfortunately not cured because well its impossible and Ill be stage 4 til the day I do go Well thats it I wanted to share my experience with the series and give my love and appreciation for GSC and all their hardwork,0,0.8537,1

Good morning My name is Cherri I was Robbies volunteer doula with the hospice program I am posting here to honor his wishes in providing this message board with an update after his passing I am not familiar with this app but Robbie gave me a little tutorial Please forgive any mistakes Robbie had initially wanted to pass while conscious however he was having increased difficulty breathing Sunday morning He received last rites from our chaplain and was sedated with midazolam at his request at 305 pm He remained asleep and appeared comfortable Agonal respirations were noted by the nurse at 614 pm and suppressed with morphine The physician called time of death at 627 pm Sunday November 15 Robbies passing was peaceful and without pain Robbie spoke often of the kind messages he received on this board I know they brought him comfort His final posting was incredibly poignant and moved even our most seasoned staff to tears He was a quiet man I think his voice was his words It was honor to attend to him in his passing I was attracted to hospice because not everybody breaks a bone not everybody has heart disease but everybody dies It is an honor to be with others as the undergo this universal journey and it was a particular honor to attend to Robbie who had no family or friends by his side I am providing some images on imager that Robbie wanted shared with this board one of him young and healthy the other a final handwritten note Please let me know if the link works I obviously cannot hold onto his phone it will be shut off and filed away with his estate which is being handled by his family who our social workers were able to locate Sunday evening They expressed regret at the news of his illness and passing We are sharing his final posting with them as well One last thing before I go First Robby expressed many concerns about his suboxone As the opiate epidemic continues to ravage our communities we see more and more patients entering hospice on suboxone and methadone I want those of you with opioid maintenance to know that you will never be judged by our staff and your medications are not a barrier for care Our organization consults with a pain specialist physician specifically for these cases We will never let you die in pain Never I hope this posting provides some closure for those of you who have been following Robbies case These fast cancers are always sad but Robbie faced his passing with dignity and grace He was truly a wonderful man and he lives on in our memories With regards Cherri N,0,0.991,1
Had peg put in Monday Had so much pain it was unbelievable They did two further CT scans and said it was all in my mind I am too sensitive etc I have been through some serious pain in my 13 year cancer career and this is the worst They put off my 1st immunotherapy because of it Apparently I am the one at fault Two days later Im still in agony I can only lie on one side but the pain is still there They refuse to admit or look for a problem Instead they close ranks isolate me in a different room and lecture me on how treatment is a gift from them If I dont play ball they will refuse me treatment Wtf Im now attached to catheter and other machines I was only supposed to be here a few days I drive myself here pulled my luggage up to the ward amd was really looking forward to my palliative treatment to lessen the growing lumps in my head and neck Now Im loosing weight can hardly stand and honestly dont know how Im getting out of here to fend for myself Does this get better I am even thinking of giving up and asking for euthanasiaover a peg,1,-0.9244,1
Hi Head and neck cancer since Cured Last year several major operations and now considered incurable The main hospital I was at recommended palliative Keytruda and Cisplatin combined Just before my 1st dose at my own countries hospital the doctor decides to just do Keytruda Any reason why do you think He says its because he doesnt want to hurt my hearingreally I dont have faith in my countrys medical services they always screw me up Eg just now the nurse comes in saying shes here to give me Keytruda and then chemotherapy I said but the doctor just told me only Keytruda She wouldnt budge until I asked for the main doctor to come and explain to me what the hell was going on She went off in a huff and came back saying well he didnt tell me Thank God I wasnt sleeping Any idea why apart from being less aggressive treatment would he just change the orders of the biggest cancer center in Europe,1,-0.9404,1
Undergoing immunotherapy treatment Ive had some quarrels with two palliative doctors over treatment Silly things Im asking them to liase with the main cancer specialists who gave my recommendations for treatment Theirs differe from the other hospital Both doctors are in a huff being contradicted by a mere patient Both have said they have other patients and if I dont like it go elsewhere This is obviously scary as there is nowhere else The other hospital is in another country Any tips on how to break through their childish behaviour Cheers,1,-0.8753,1

Hey guys I had never carried a balance before but the pandemic plus a few family crises left me living off my credit cards and I could no longer pay the minimums on some of them The debt on two of them is set to be charged off next month and Im not sure what the best course of action is I dont currently have the money needed to pay settlement offers but is it better to save up for that or set up a 60month payment plan The payment plan will still report me as being delinquent right So is it better for my future credit to let them get charged off and save up for settlement offers Or does that look terrible to creditors in the future Thank you for any help,0,0.9716,1

Heres some background from my post about this before Basically because of my treatment my nose and mouth tend to bleed a lot if I engage in strenuous activity ie sex or anything that raises my heart rate or makes me strain Aside from that my sex drive was at 0 due to the medicines My husband has been very supportive and hasnt demanded anything of me but I felt bad about the situation and hated that he couldnt get any intimacy So I got a ton of suggestions from people here on the sub and some of them really worked I just wanted to make an update for the good folks here who made great tips We tried a lot of things that didnt work for many different reasons For example anything related to touching me such as cuddling or kissing would instantly result in a nosebleed Basically anything that would make me horny is a nono This was the most significant challenge because his pleasure was based around mine But apparently massages particularly on his buttocks really worked I get no pleasure from using my hands and he hated handjobs but we found out that he really liked being touched all over his body instead and the oil turned him on as well Afterwards I would use a silicone tool for him someone suggested this and its so cool to simulate sex All the while I didnt need to get naked or anything and my heart rate stayed stable Weve been experimenting on blindfolds as well Lastly I found some oral lubrication sprays that someone told me about through DM thank you for that most of all that helped prevent bleeding a lot It allowed me to do oral more comfortably though Im still terrible at it lol Anyway things have improved a lot thanks to you fine folks You basically saved my dead bedroom Even if its just for him its enough and our bond is even stronger now Thank you,0,0.9936,1

Im 40f the breadwinner of the family and my husband voluntarily closed down his business in order to take better care of our daughter and myself I was diagnosed with cancer almost 4 years ago Im fine now story in my profile and living a very active lifestyle I run a successful business and we dont have any financial difficulties whatsoever Even with my diagnosis I didnt want to stop working as honestly it gives me purpose and keeps me positive To facilate this my husband took it upon himself to end his career so that he could always cook healthy meals for me be my physical trainer be my oncall nurse he trained himself do all the house chores and errands and basically always be available at all times whenever I needed to go to the hospital or some other emergency This has enabled me to continue my work without worrying about anything Sometimes though he has a tendency to panic about our familys finances I get it coz he isnt involved in it at all anymore so of course there will be some trepidation I do my best to reassure him that things are fine and we can afford to go on vacations or buy gadgets and whatnot However every time I buy something remotely expensive or I make some investment in anything he literally flies off the wall It feels like he doesnt trust me Im not saying Im some financial wizard or anything but in the intervening years after my diagnosis Ive basically doubled our net worth despite him not working anymore Yet just last night he was questioning me again and panicking about our financial situation I showed him our bank statements but he still feels that we need to save more stop spending cancel our vacation etc I get really annoyed and upset whenever he does this Last night I got pissed when he kept on about it I felt like all my hard work was being marginalized Im not sure what to say or do anymore to get him to simply stop worrying Am I overreacting,1,-0.9309,1
I just finished steward difficulty and it was hell for me I felt like an idiot coz reading posts on this sub had me believing that the game is easy and I just suck Then I took a look at the steam achievements page and found out that Only 3 of players have finished steward difficulty Only 14 of players have finished captain difficulty And even on any difficulty only 25 of players have finished the game Soooo No the game isnt easy especially from steward and above For the vast majority of players like myself its hard as hell I had to play through it 5 times to get to the end Some of you guys 1 of you are just good at the game,1,-0.9502,1
Kind of a unique issue here I hope youll bear with me Ive posted before on different subs about my condition Basically I have cancer Im fine dont worry and the treatment prevents my husband and I from having sex People advised me to seek alternative ways to have intimacy to please him and theyve largely worked massage oil toys etc Thing is even before my diagnosis Ive always had trouble with his size However I was able to figure out various means to deal with it at the time when we were still having sex through changing positions using lube etc But its different now since we cant have sex While hes okay with the stuff I mentioned before hes asking for oral a lot more often now coz of my limitations Ive always been uncomfortable with it partially because Im not that experienced but mostly because hes just big Ive told him various times about this but he asks for it every time anyway almost begging at times I understand of course coz hes had to suppress his desire in consideration of my condition He has never complained about it When I try to give him oral I frequently gag and it feels really uncomfortable Fortunately when this happens he stops me and apologizes and we just try to do some other thing Still the next time we do something he asks for it again and the cycle continues How do I communicate to him that I dont want to do oral anymore or is there some way for me to make this more comfortable,0,0.6865,1

Things normally go really well between us but tonight we really exploded It all started when I forgot my keys and asked him to come open the door I know its petty He told me to come to the lobby so he can hand me the keys as he was in the car with our sleeping daughter and couldnt just leave her there But my feet hurt and I didnt want to go downstairs again so I kinda got really irritated and snapped He then started to semimock me by repeatedly telling me that I could walk 30 steps just to get the keys and I knew I was behaving like a primadonna but I didnt care and yelled at him anyway I ended up getting the keys anyway Ugh Hes right and I know it But I was so pissed and the argument dragged on into the night and all sorts of things got hashed out in the open Apparently hes been really upset that I have no consideration for him and I take his feelings for granted I didnt really realize this and I thought Id been giving him plenty of consideration I admit I have not been spending as much time with him as I used to and I tend to be very blunt about things Also as I have cancer our intimacy has been severely limited Hes been very understanding about it but he tonight his bottle was full and the frustration boiled over It was an awful fight He was crying and I was crying and he ripped his shirt off and we said a lot of stuff we didnt mean Ugh I hated it so much,1,-0.9958,1
For context my first post from 3 days ago Basically I have cancer Im fine so we cant have sex due to my treatment Hed been asking for more oral as a result and Im happy to do everything I can to please him but oral is uncomfortable because hes quite large In between that and just now we had a huge fight which was my fault but it ended up okay I did have to make it up to him I followed a lot of the advice some of the kind folks here gave me Before I would gag and struggle to even get past the head and you all made me realize I was simply doing it wrong I thought that it was necessary to actually suck the thing Instead I focused on licking and kissing and using my hands a lot more Someone suggested coconut oil as a lubricant and it worked wonders I didnt mind the taste so I could lick freely without gagging and focused on tickling and rubbing him with my hands Many told me to keep eye contact and talk dirty but those are still too awkward for me Ill have to work on it Someone also suggested focusing licking his testicles then using my hands at the same time and I think that became his favorite part of the whole thing Anyway it was a great experience for both of us He told me it was better than actual sex And I felt so empowered that despite my condition I could really please his desires this time without any discomfort I know its not my fault in the first place but Ive always had a compulsion to try and do what I can to make the best of the situation Our previous attempts were okay but they did feel sort of halfassed from my point of view he never complained but I could feel it This is really important to me because my treatment is basically for the rest of my life So finding this long term solution I think will improve our relationship over time Ive already ordered some of the sleeves and toys others suggested and Im sure theyll spice things up even more for him I just want to thank everyone for their suggestions and not laughing at my ineptitude I was sort of afraid to post about it coz Im inexperienced and my question sounded stupid in my head Thank you again Edit if you have other suggestions or whatever just dm I appreciate every tidbit of information,0,0.9903,1
For context on my last update yesterday Basically a lot of kind people here offered lots of suggestions on how I could solve our intimacy issue I have cancer and we cant have sex husband is too big for oral full story in my profile and I implemented a bunch of them and they worked out great Many of the other tips I received centered around using tools and toys and today they arrived I cant discuss them in detail but basically I got a sleeve a vibrating ring and a silicone vagina Thank you to the commenters who suggested them But the only thing that ended up helping was the vibrating ring Someone sent me a dm about it and explained how its used so thank you coz it really worked At first it was uncomfortable to put on but thankfully it was stretchable It made him even bigger I didnt think it was possible and harder than usual and I suppose it salvaged the evening for us The other 2 were too small for him to fit and they were already the largest sizes I could find admittedly Im in a rather conservative area sex shops arent so common around here and international shipping is abysmal When we did marginally succeed with the sleeve it irritated him and he described the feeling as like being sucked on by a clammy fish We laughed so hard at that Maybe we just didnt use it right About dirty talk and eye contact Im still terrible Whenever I say anything I still sound like an AI I have a foreign accent so when I speak it doesnt sound natural Complimenting him about his size made me cringe My moans also sounded like sheep coz Im not actually turned on Im not allowed to be coz I would bleed like crazy which is why we cant have sex in the first place This led to eye contact being a problem coz looking at his face filled with pleasure makes it impossible for me to not be turned on which led my nose to bleed immediately Still it turned out well probably better than yesterday coz we were laughing so much while using the toys After my bleeding stopped we just went with what we did yesterday this time while wearing the vibrating ring focusing licking on his testicles while using my hands and added someones suggestion to lick his perineum which drove him crazy Theres clearly a lot of room for improvement though Overall hes having a blast and Im comfortable doing it No more gagging for me Im really happy about the improvements weve made I honestly feel like Im connecting with this community coz somehow you understand my issues forgiving my ineptitude and I appreciate that a lot It might seem like a small issue woman cant handle her husbands size but with my circumstances it means a lot that Ive been able to solve it I love my husband and I dont want him to feel deprived of anything If anyone has other suggestions feel free to let me know,0,0.9964,1
Note This story is about what occurred months ago We are fine now We are currently back to having regular sexual sessions more info in my profile Im posting this first so you would have background on how we got to where we are now Other parts which will be posted later on will clarify In short Im a cancer patient and sex makes me bleed due to the treatment As a result we had to stop having sex HOWEVER Im completely fine now and Im currently beating the disease so dont offer sympathy lol just enjoy the story Ive decided to write about my experiences just to document it and for a lil fun I bleed when I get intensely horny but sex stories seem to be mild enough for some personal fun without the blood First attempt forgive me true 2 embellished Again Im fine Please enjoy the story and dont worry about me I came hard so intensely that I lay in a pool of my own blood unable to process what was happening Panic stricken he rushed to me grabbing me wiping my overflowing nostrils trying to stem the flow I was putty in his hands for a brief moment still in an orgasmic trance until I realized I had blown a gasket Again Every time Every fucking time I cant even enjoy his tongue on my pussy without creating a crimson mask Are my orgasms simply too much for my fragile nerves to handle Truth be told I knew before we started I knew I would bleed again I knew it would get worse as he finger fucked me I knew I was bleeding minutes into him lathering my clit with saliva I knew that tiny vessels in my mouth and nose had splintered the moment he slid my panties off I even knew what would happen before my hand met his huge cock during dinner I even knew it days before weeks before I cant have sex anymore I cant cum anymore Thats just how fucked up life is Cancer is a real bitch Its bad enough that its trying to kill me whats worse is that in the process of me kicking its ass like I said Im totally fine coz Im kicking cancer to the curb its making basic functions more challenging Its hard to eat Its difficult to sleep Its a chore to even get out of bed But Im fighting it and Im winning I dont want any sympathy I just want to live normally However cancer had one more insult one more fuck you to send to me before I could bury it for good It took my husbands big dick away from me That same dick that I fantasize about every day when I touch myself when hes not home The same dick that had once made me cum four times in a row due to its veins pounding my walls as it throbbed relentlessly The treatment causes my bloods platelets to bottom out causing me to bleed easily whenever I strain myself or if my heart rate soars like when he fucks me So I denied it I didnt care what would happen to me I would never allow myself to be starved of the services of his cock After treatment that night I hatched a plan that would defy the odds and I would continue to be railed and he wouldnt be able to stop himself from stuffing me silly I had to be devious hes so careful these days and would outright refuse to fuck me out of fear Right before this I had attempted to lick his ear to goad him into sex He grabbed me and whispered in my ear its okay baby we dont have to Fuck that shit We have to You have to fuck me So I uncharacteristically dressed like a slut and behaved like one all evening I would not be denied As he cooked I ran my nails over his ass His anus was his weakness and I exploited it You like that huh Pervert Mind you Im normally an innocent conservative pure petite lady If you saw me in public youd think Im a librarian or a congresswoman In contrast my husband used to be a basketball player so I barely reach his nipples Therefore perhaps my sudden overt interest in his butt had given him a few convulsions He certainly had gotten himself worked up quite quickly as his dick had become clearly outlined on his pants within seconds of my scratches His size had always fascinated me being such a small girl in both negative and positive ways Its bad that his penis is almost as big as my forearm making it so difficult to suck which presents a secondary problem the image of me struggling with his big head makes him want me to blow him even more despite my discomfort He thinks its sexy to see me gag on his dick and he loves the feeling of my tiny mouth around his girth Its also bad that I need special positions just to fit him inside me Its bad that when hes inside me I cant feel my hands Or my feet Or my brain Its good Its just good I apologize I never meant any insult Mr John what I call his dick May I please you with my pussy today To make up for being a bad girl To make up for saying your dick was too big for my tiny hole No those werent random ramblings I had whispered those dirty words an inch from his ear during dinner You might imagine that he slapped me as he had never heard such words from my innocent mouth before He did slap me Then kissed me His tongue flooded me I felt it squirming not just in my mouth but also down into my esophagus desperately reaching into my core It was not a tongue but a reflection of the big cock I was going to shove into my throat later on and he was merely lubricating the way I was also spreading my own lubrication I had quietly freed his hard rod and smeared his precum all over the shaft I have always loved standing and kissing with reckless abandon with something hard yet soft resting on my palm All the while I kept telling the lesions and tumors in my body take that bitchass cancer But Ive always thought my husband was quite strange in that he wouldnt just take my obvious desire and transform it into his own orgasm immediately He always required tribute A sacrifice that I must pay in order for me to qualify as a worshipper of his big cock He needed me to cum multiple times before he would allow me access It was a requirement There was never any negotiation As much as I would beg him to fuck me he would just lay me down and suck on my clit before anything would occur And that climax would always come Alwyayssdsas Always His tongue is a magnificent creature that feeds on my pussy juice and devours all of its contents ravenously and mercilessly My clit would always respond erect from the first lick and it would take him seconds to find the right spot to make me gush I would blush as a result as remember being a demure lady I mustnt make squealing sounds and animalistic moans like a common slut But in each of these offerings of tribute I become nothing but a servant to the will of his licks The same ritual was about to occur that fine evening He removed my hand and proceeded to brutally caress my panties away He stared at me and mouthed the words cum for me before his lips touched my knees A drop of blood trickled down my left nostril I wiped it away His tongue kissed my inner thigh My heart signaled a warning My pussy silenced it He licked my pubic hair I could taste my life in my mouth I swallowed it all He ran his wet lips on my clit My nostrils were full and I couldnt breathe I gasped He inserted his tongue into my vagina before gliding up my cunt The floodgates were getting ripped open Ripppppepds iopen He began making circles around the head and writing my name in letters I could recognize There were no floodgates left to rip A thousand horses had suddenly materialized in me and rushed out in unison I was nothing and no one Fukckckc I came hard so intensely that I lay in a pool of my own blood unable to process what was happening Panic stricken he rushed to me grabbing me wiping my overflowing nostrils trying to stem the flow I was putty in his hands for a brief moment until I realized I had blown a gasket Again For an hour we tried stopping it in every way we knew how It wasnt the first time after all But this was different He recognized the fear and love and love and love in my eyes and rushed me to the emergency room where they finally found a way to stop the bleeding Shit this guy must really love me huh Because months later we still hadnt had sex again but he never opened his mouth about it He never complained He never found another innocent pussy to torture He never asked me either I never asked him either To be continued Thank you for reading D Part 2,1,-0.9991,1
Part 1 Note Im a cancer patient and sex makes me bleed due to the treatment As a result we had to stop having sex HOWEVER Im completely fine now and Im currently beating the disease so dont offer sympathy lol just enjoy the story Ive decided to write about my experiences just to document it and for a lil fun I bleed when I get intensely horny but sex stories seem to be mild enough for some personal fun without the blood true 2 embellished Thank you for everyone who read part 1 Again Im fine Please enjoy the story and dont worry about me He came hard in my mouth so intensely that I started choking on his thick cum What had begun as some tender playful banter turned into him shoving his dick in my mouth recklessly barbarically It felt like I had been reduced to a hole in the wall I had begun a journey towards making my mouth into his personal cumslut It wasnt comfortable I gagged dozens of times and felt like vomiting However one look on his face made it all worth it It was glorious Beforehand he was fearful and worried lovingly tender and reassuring Its dangerous I dont want to hurt you Its okay we dont have to over and over as if fucking me would kill me Fine it could But by this point it had been weeks since we had anything intimate That trip to the emergency room really changed our perspectives on what we could and could not do I would have to compromise on my own pleasure anything that increases my heart rate substantially or makes me strain will cause me to bleed cancer is a bitch But nothing even that was going to stop me from having his dick We had talked about it and agreed that we couldnt have sex anymore Treatment is basically for life Im a stage 4 patient but again Im fine and as long as Im taking it I will bleed Theres really nothing I can do about it But I love my husband very sincerely and hes done everything to keep me strong and healthy Weve come so far in this journey together that I would literally do anything for him and vice versa Therefore this bleeding problem was just a hiccup a speed bump that we would have to overcome together After all my appetite for his cock was insatiable and I simply would not be denied That day I was feeling especially slutty I knew he had been pent up after weeks of not getting his daily release and I found myself staring at his crotch all day Slow down girl I also knew I couldnt get too horny or else a faucet would spring up in my nose I had to keep a very delicate balancing act that would take him to the edge without necessarily dragging me there with him We manage a real estate business together and he had been pouring his frustrations into work but I could tell that the stress was getting to him It was a warm Sunday afternoon and it was just the two of us in his personal office At that point a form of tension had forced its way between us and we had become more distant Fuck this I said to myself I decided then that enough was enough I was wearing a very professional silk blouse and a tight business skirt while he sported his usual gray suit the one that makes me daydream about getting pounded as a dirty secretary I stood up pulled my glasses down and stared at him I pulled up my skirt and dropped my panties to the floor I sashayed around the carpet telling him I needed his cock with my eyes He stared back with worry and love and fear and lust He wanted it I wanted it I sat on his thigh and he felt my damp pussy messing up his pants Stop he said Keep going his eyes said I delicately placed my fingers on his chest and started massaging him Wait he said Scratch my nipples his eyes said I unbuttoned his shirt and bit them I licked his areolas in a wide circle almost like a tiny cat purring lustfully Meanwhile I forcibly slipped a finger into his mouth That kept him quiet My other hand had unzipped his pants My pussy tingled as I felt his precum on the tip of his massive cock I found myself riding his leg and rubbing my clit on the rough polyester Fuck I was getting close to the threshold Its so fucking huge Fuck I played with the sticky substance with my fingers and rubbed it all over Fuck I could feel something rising in my throat My current state threatened to end everything before it could get started A few drops of blood fell from my nose to his shirt and he immediately sat up and grabbed my hands to stop me I froze He froze He shook his head Its okay baby we dont have to Again Those shitty words But I wrenched myself free from his grip and took a deep breath as I wiped my face clean Zen meditation has worked quite a bit to control my heart rate I lifted my pussy off his soaked pant leg and kissed his hands Gently I told myself I went to his ear and whispered dont try to stop me before sinking my nails into his frenulum He still tried to stop me but I was firm I scratched his glans and his balls and kissed him and drowned him with my lust Slowly his resistance vanished Ignoring my pussys screams of fuck him now I gently massaged the shaft and used my nails to increase the tension But I also knew that my handjobs didnt exactly do it for him Im writing this now pretending to be some sort of amazing whore but the truth is Im quite inexperienced My husband is actually the only man Ive ever been with His cock is the only one Ive ever touched or sucked Im not very good at pleasing him at all His dick is so big and Im so unskilled that I struggle to get even just the head in my mouth I frequently gag and choke whenever I try to suck it However this exact struggle is what turns him on the most He loves seeing my tiny mouth attempt to fit his girth Hes that kind of perverted masochist I love it After another deep breath I got on my knees and spat on the head I turned my tongue in a clockwise direction around it lubricating it loving it I stared daggers directly into his blue eyes loving him giving him his due letting him know that I want him and only him and that even though he temporarily the minute cancer is gone were back to fucking cant have my pussy he can have everything else for as long as it takes I sucked him like I had never done before I ignored my gag reflex and shoved past the head for the first time and worked my tongue on the underside of his enormous shaft like my life depended on it I was hot My pussy was drenched I resisted the urge to touch my clit and it was enough to keep me from bleeding Somehow the difficulty of working his huge cock was balancing my lust and preventing it from gushing overboard But it was enough for me to see his pleasure His love His lust His grunts filled the room as my fingers had both his nipples pinned As I mentioned Im not particularly good at this kind of thing But today I was extra motivated to have him cum for me I would not be denied my prize He grabbed me by the ears and told me he was going to cum I tightened my grip and scratched his chest I went as deep as I could on his cock He attempted to stand up and pull it out at the last moment but I was ready for him I grabbed his ass and scratched his anus His legs shook His salty cum flooded my throat He came hard in my mouth so intensely that I started choking on his thick cum What had begun as some tender playful banter turned into him shoving his dick in my mouth recklessly barbarically It felt like I had been reduced to a hole in the wall I had begun a journey towards making my mouth into his personal cumslut It wasnt comfortable I gagged dozens of times and felt like vomiting However one look on his face made it all worth it It was glorious He had never cum in my mouth before though I had always wanted him to try However he always hesitated to do so out of fear Today I calmed that fear I coughed and had tears in my eyes He sat beside me on the floor and we hugged it out We stayed like that for several minutes before we straightened ourselves up and went back to work All the tension was gone My pussy complained but my overall satisfaction at seeing his satisfaction made it all worthwhile Tomorrow and for the weeks to come he would fuck my throat and I would greedily take his cum To be continued Thank you for reading D Part 3,0,0.5097,1
Part 1 Part 2 Note Im a cancer patient and sex makes me bleed due to the treatment As a result we had to stop having sex HOWEVER Im completely fine now and Im currently beating the disease so dont offer sympathy lol just enjoy the story Ive decided to write about my experiences just to document it and for a lil fun I bleed when I get intensely horny but sex stories seem to be mild enough for some personal fun without the blood true 2 embellished Thank you for everyone who read part 1 and 2 Again Im fine Please enjoy the story and dont worry about me He came all over my face so forcefully that I flinched and hit my head on the desk Honestly sucking his dick had become quite a chore Recently weve been doing it daily and its quite difficult when youre a tiny girl with cancer and your mans penis is monstrously large Im not complaining though dont get me wrong I absolutely worship his cock I wouldnt have it any differently Im just being honest about the arduous process of sucking him off because we cant have intercourse Like I said previously I would do anything to please my man However the blowjobs were starting to wear me down and I had to come up with something different to ease the process He simply doesnt fit my tiny mouth as well as my tiny everything So I did what any selfrespecting inexperienced woman would do I asked Reddit my posts are still up in my profile My husband would kill me though if he found out I was talking about our sex life were very private people It was actually a thrill for me to publicize semi coz Im still anonymous around here my problem and ask various strangers how to deal with my husbands big cock I was both nervous and excited about the concept and some of the tips I received made me unconsciously horny for some unknown reason thankfully not enough to make my nose bleed I was told by lots of kind redditors that the secret lay with licking tickling and positioning I could please my man without having to actually suck his dick they said Some people were very gracious and gave detailed accounts on what I could do with my fingers and tongue some to the point of them sending unsolicited dick pics but on the whole the experience was both enlightening and hot I was secretly touching my clit lightly through my panties while imagining what I could do to my husband I was all wet while I typed responses to a guy who showed me how his girl licked his big black cock and how she sucked his balls while playing with the shaft with her fingers What made it hotter was how clinical he was about it Focus your tongue on his perineum its the spot between his testicles and his anus I imagined my husbands balls I never really gave them much attention before Hm his dick is bigger than this guys I thought to myself while I masturbated I nearly rubbed myself to orgasm But dont worry I knew when to stop I imagined how I would do it and even practiced on my dildo that afternoon I hadnt used it in awhile but I thought a few runs with it would help While doing it I realized that all this time I never really used my tongue all that much Being a very conservative girl I thought of sex as something very formulaic I suck he licks we fuck He was obviously the same in that he never really asked for anything different or he just loved my tight mouth and pussy so much that he didnt need to Weve always been very vanilla so trying these new things now made me extremely horny I imagined my husbands scrotum and how Id stretch it with my lips I thought about what his face would look like Hes fucking handsome He always has the best orgasm faces My dildo was drenched with saliva when I was done and so was I This is kind of dangerous My husband and I are both serious gamers in our free time After dinner he was playing Diablo on his desk and I was sitting behind him pondering when I should initiate his daily milking session Usually I just grab his hand and he knew what time it was Id lead him to the room and suck his cock greedily until he came in my mouth But I also thought about how we could spice things up while implementing my new plan so I did what every gamer has ever fantasized about God Im becoming so slutty I love it I moved his chair slightly away from the desk He looked up at me with a quizzical yet expectant look it was 9pm which was his scheduled blowjob time as I slowly knelt down in front of him I lifted my skirt up just enough to show him I wasnt wearing panties I know I cant cum but the visual was still important as he loved seeing my hairless pussy I didnt touch him at first I wanted his expectations to build I hadnt done anything at that point but his cock was already standing against his shorts I followed another set of suggestions from another kind redditor with a big dick I bit my lips put my hair up slowly and tied it behind me licked my fingers rubbed my nipples through my sports bra itsy bitsy spidered my way up his crotch kept eye contact A huge wet spot formed where the tip of his penis lay He was motionless Silent Unmoving It was almost as if he was shocked that his innocent little wife was willing to do something hes probably dreamed of all his life Play your game I told him He casually pulled his chair forward and got clicking I was so fucking horny but kept my breathing Zen saved my life there I slowly pulled on his shorts and he obliged by lifting his butt up slightly His cock bounced up as it went free I hesitated Ive sucked him so many times but every time I see it I still salivate I put two fingers on the shiny tip and held it up away from my face Then with meticulous care I kissed his left testicle His scrotum immediately shriveled up Then I licked the right and put it in my mouth His balls actually were disproportionately small compared to his huge cock so I didnt have any trouble sucking them He gasped The clicking stopped I pinched the head and stopped as well signaling that I wouldnt continue if he didnt keep playing The game went on I then lifted his ballsack and got to work on my prize I mentioned before that his anus was his weakness and I was used to scratching and caressing it It never occurred to me that there was a more sensitive spot right in the middle I licked him testily right above his asshole He froze I licked it again this time closer to his balls Meanwhile I had begun to stroke his shaft with my fingers His legs shook I looked up at his face through my thick glasses and found that he had his eyes closed Seeing him in such pleasure fucked me up bad I was dripping wet My nose started too I quickly mopped my face up and took several deep breaths His trance immediately broke and he crouched down to help me I waved him away with a smile and a kiss and pushed him back onto his chair It was a cathartic moment for me being so comfortable pleasing him as previously it had always been difficult Maybe to you this was just a small thing But for a girl like me and my conservative background it felt like such a victory I crawled back into position and buried my lips into his scrotum Being so close to his balls was addictive I was licking and sucking them alternately like I was possessed while his precum dripped all over my lips I had wrapped my hand around his dick and had started to pump it vigorously staring at him him staring back his game all but forgotten Im gonna cuummm he whispered I then followed another suggestion from another big dicked redditor I positioned his big head onto my face He came all over my face so forcefully that I flinched and hit my head on the desk Honestly sucking his dick had become quite a chore Recently Ive been doing it daily and its quite difficult when youre a tiny girl with cancer and your mans penis is monstrously large Im not complaining though dont get me wrong I absolutely worship his cock I wouldnt have it any differently Im just being honest about the arduous process of sucking him off because we cant have intercourse But this tonight not having to struggle yet getting an even better result I cant put into words how it felt Of course I was burning up with no opportunity to cum and that sucked but I felt extremely validated I was

Its a setback sure But since when does the white house dictate who you are and what you do Today youre still a good person who cares about hisher family Tomorrow youll still be that same person In 4 years youll be even better when America votes for a better leader Trump has been in this position in and the world didnt end America is still America You are still you The amount of damage he can do is overstated and exaggerated Remember why youre here Its not because of some silly election Youre here for your loved ones whether the person sitting in the big chair is wearing red or blue It doesnt matter what color they got on You are still you,0,0.9564,1

I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer terminal almost 4 years ago It had spread to my pituitary gland spinal cord and adrenal gland full story in my profile Recently scans showed that most of the tumors have disappeared while the one in my pituitary is stable Then today I got my most recent blood numbers and my white blood cells and platelets are the best theyve ever been The platelets are still below the normal range but when Ive been struggling with bleeding for so long seeing that 3 digit number is amazing for me Spreading hope to other patients out there,0,0.7814,1

Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Note Im a cancer patient and sex makes me bleed due to the treatment As a result we had to stop having sex HOWEVER Im completely fine now and Im currently beating the disease so dont offer sympathy lol just enjoy the story Ive decided to write about my experiences just to document it and for a lil fun I bleed when I get intensely horny but sex stories seem to be mild enough for some personal fun without the blood true 2 embellished Thank you for everyone who read part 1 2 and 3 Again Im fine Please enjoy the story and dont worry about me Suddenly he came on my oily outstretched hand so smoothly that at first that I didnt even realize he was cumming Feeling his sticky cum made me come back to my senses We had developed a convenient routine for draining his balls He basically cums on my command now Even though its now a onesided affair his satisfaction has somehow become mine as well Whenever he cums for me it almost feels like Im having an orgasm as well Since I dont need to strain myself anymore because of the new techniques I learned with my tongue and hands the process has become expedient However that hasnt stopped me from wanting to learn more But thats only half the story Beyond learning I had discovered that I get really horny when strangers teach me about sex but not hot enough to make me bleed A guy showed me how he rubs his thick cock in an effort to teach me how I should touch my husband I kept the conversation platonic but secretly I was touching my pussy through my panties Ive been doing this for weeks now My husband doesnt know and I feel somewhat guilty So why not just let him touch me but control it and stop before I bleed No its impossible Ive been trying to explain in previous parts of this story that Im obsessed with his massive dick Im obsessed to the point that whenever I feel even the slightest bit horny I forget hes a person and think of him as just a piece of meat made to fuck me Every time I suck him I have to take deep breaths and imagine the ocean just to prevent myself from exploding If I let him touch me Ill probably end up in the hospital again No its enough for me to have these little innocent conversations Theyre learning experiences I swear I have no ulterior motives Im a slut for my man and only my man Mmm I suppose theres this one girl Im not lesbian who taught me about the benefits of using oil She told me all about tantric massages and showed me several videos on how to please a mans penis and delay his orgasm She also showed me how she would put her mans dick between her big tits and how he would cum all over them I got dizzy watching her I rubbed my wet clit imagining me doing the same but then I remembered I didnt have the tits to pull it off I only have one now due to surgery Its fine he doesnt mind He loves sucking my one nipple This girl got me thinking Maybe Im bisexual Or maybe Im just curious Who knows The point is she made me want to try it on my man I got a bottle of massage oil and got set to practice with my dildo The majority of the experience is supposed to be more about teasing and prolonging his pleasure so I set myself to the task I learned to touch lightly almost featherlike and use my nails with the intent to graze to make it feel like an accident He always gets hard in public when I happen to touch his crotch I love how he can never hide it because hes so fucking huge Massaging my dildo made me so hot that I just had to take off my clothes I was entranced I had one hand on the shaft and the other on my pussy I also discovered that the oil on my fingers made rubbing my clit more comfortable and it enabled me to rub it less slowing down my orgasmic tendencies Fuck I thought Fuck fuck fuck I tend to cum multiple times really quickly but that could just be because my husband is so good at licking my cunt I stopped just before my orgasm built up I was so fucking happy that I wasnt bleeding Before my husband got home that night I made some small preparations I placed a towel and a donut shaped pillow for his face on the bed I lit a couple of scented candles I put on some spa music I decorated the room a little with some plants and a tiny fountain I placed a humidifier around his head area Finally I put on a sluttylooking cheongsam a Chinese traditional outfit with fish decorations and a high slit that showed my nonexistent curves Fuck it he likes that Im petite When he arrived I welcomed him like a receptionist would Welcome sir I said with fluttering eyelashes He instantly understood and let go I whisked him by the hands towards my carefully crafted massage parlor and carefully removed his jacket My hand lingered on his chest I unbuttoned his shirt He smelled of manly sweat I led him to the bathroom I knelt down and unbuckled his belt His hard cock pushed against his pants I pulled them down slowly taking in the view of his shaft struggling against his boxers I looked up at him smiling He looked down at me smiling I gently pushed him towards the shower With his back turned I put my hands in his waistband and pulled down his underwear taking care to accidentally scratch his backside and hamstrings He gasped I turned on the water and took the showerhead to wash his ass I ran my fingernails through his asshole light enough mind you to almost not be noticeable I used my new featherlight touch all over his butt while kissing his back with the same lightness I was fucking thrilled I had never done anything so erotic I had him face me with a professional smile His hard dick was already leaking and I hadnt even touched it yet Good I poured some body wash on the base of the shaft More precum gushed out I stroked it gently with one hand while the other went to his testicles Soap bubbles were all over my fingers My beautifully prepared outfit was now soaking wet So was I I washed the soap off his cock and turned off the water He protested and clearly wanted me to keep stroking him I smiled and toweled him dry before dragging him back to the room He had his hand on my ass through the slit on my dress I slapped it away I had him lay on the bed face down which was slightly difficult due to his big dick being in the way I spread his legs and sat in the gap I lathered my hands with oil and rubbed them together Cold hands may make him lose his erection I remembered the girl telling me Shes so fucking hot I wonder how it would be if she were here too Now warmed I started my strokes I ran my hands on his asshole just like in the shower but the heat and the oil made him moan and his body twitched hard He thrashed around on the towel as I ran my fingers on his perineum and the edges of his scrotum I could see his hard cock peeking on the side That must be uncomfortable I had him raise his crotch with a gentle tug while putting a rolled towel underneath to support his weight I then pulled his penis backwards so that it was now pointing at me You like that sir I whispered into his ear then licked it He could only moan his approval I poured oil all over the shaft and proceeded to lightly tickle it with the back of one hand while keeping the other playing with his butthole and balls just like the video showed me I was a good student He couldnt lie still His legs were crushing me and I loved it I pinched the base of his scrotum and started pulling on his big cock towards me in steady strokes the oil made my movements extremely fluid and smooth such that I didnt have to work hard at all I was so fucking wet I was soooo fucking wet Nonetheless I knew he didnt have much time left but I was enjoying it so much that I lost focus on what I was doing and started rubbing my clit on the towel underneath I was losing my mind Suddenly he came on my oily outstretched hand so smoothly that at first that I didnt even realize he was cumming Feeling his sticky cum made me come back to my senses We had developed a convenient routine for draining his balls He basically cums on my command now Even though its now a onesided affair his satisfaction has somehow become mine as well Whenever he cums for me it almost feels like Im having an orgasm as well Since I dont need to strain myself anymore because of the new techniques I learned with my tongue and hands the process has become expedient However that hasnt stopped me from wanting to learn more I almost came too Fuck My trance broke completely and I finally realized that he had been yelling my name over and over and now he was crumpled I went over and kissed him Deeply It was the kind of kiss you give to a lover you havent seen in years and the kind that you burn into your soul as proof that you love him All my desire vanished I was filled with love To be continued Thank you for reading D,0,0.9989,1
4 months ago I made this post here A lot has happened since then Basically my cancer causes me to bleed when I get excited preventing us from having sex My husband and I have experimented on a lot of different things many stories in my profile if youre interested Over the past few months weve been doing a lot better with me at least being able to satisfy him in various ways Today on new years eve we made another significant step After an incredibly long time we finally got to have sex again The cause of the bleeding is my platelets being too low due to chemotherapy Being stage 4 my therapy doesnt have an ending However over time I had steadily made progress on increasing my levels through extreme diet and exercise Today I tested myself and finally got back to normal lowest end of normal but fuck it I worked my ass off to get here and I fucking love life So this morning I simply went for it I dived back into bed upon receiving my results and I shoved it in his face But it wasnt just the sex It was like a celebration of our journey together and all the sacrifices weve made I cried while making love It was just Finally Im not trying to gloat or anything and I apologize if I offend anyone I just wanted to share to perhaps provide a little hope as well to everyone else struggling here Its possible even for someone like me with an incurable disease Happy new year everyone,0,0.9482,1
Im debating between 2 schools of thought 1 Palpatine was so powerful that he was directing the space battle manually as he sat on his chair using the force to control the commandersships This is why the empire was winning while he was still in control and they started losing as he got increasingly distracted by the VaderLuke fight That would mean that had Vader not killed the emperor the empire would have won the battle Or 2 Palpatine wasnt really in control of the battle outside and the empire was just winning at the start due to the surprise advantage The rebels started winning on their own regardless and the emperors death had no influence on the battle whatsoever That would mean it was just as Luke said that Palpatines weakness was his overconfidence Im about to explain this to my daughter whos asking me this irritatingly good question What do you guys think,1,-0.2718,1
Solo Rogue One We started with Solo and Rogue One not for story reasons I wanted her to have a positive first impression of the series from a tech point of view shes a kid exposed to great graphics I was afraid episode 4 would look too antique for her and I also wanted her first dip into the series to be notsoserious Episode So we didnt start with episode 1 because obviously I wanted her to have the I am your father moment unspoiled and it worked She was completely O faced Episode 1 the Mandalorian then Then we went to the prequel trilogy to provide context with the Mandalorian squeezed in between 1 and 2 for Fett I personally think that arent all bad particularly for worldbuilding and getting the kids engaged Ending with episode 6 I really wanted to end everything with episode 6 and leave it at that 6 ends so perfectly and caps the story so well and I dont want to ruin it with the Disney shenanigans If she wants to see in the future thats on her,0,0.9767,1

All this ham stuff seems to just push Luke away from the dark side even more as saying them made Luke realize what hes doing Every time he talks Luke stops attacking I can feel your anger turns away from palpatine Strike me down and your journey towards the dark side will be complete turns away from palpatine Good Use your aggressive feelings boy Let the hate flow through you stops attacking Vader i wont fight you father And just as Luke was about to strike Vader down Good Your hate has made you powerful Now fulfill your destiny and take your fathers place at my side looks at his hand and stops fighting i am a Jedi like my father before me I mean If youre so mad yet some guy keeps narrating how mad you are Youd feel less mad right I think Luke wouldve finished Vader if Palpatine hadnt kept reminding him of his hatred,1,-0.9684,1

I actually agree with most critics and sane posters the game is great The ages are fantastic as they motivate me to finish games even if Im losing or winning The streamlining of concepts is great The music is awesome And they included my favorite person of all time as a playable leader But the UI is really really really a mess Im not a young lady anymore and my eyesight isnt great so I have to make the text bigger which then makes the text fall all over the place That was the first OMG moment for me I had never seen something like that before Everything looks blurry I cant even see what units are on a particular tile as the icon is so small The tech trees are so amateurish looking that my daughter remarked she could design a better looking one shes a kid Im so confused about everything despite me actually recognizing that the game is better than civ 6 I Dont feel that one more turn feeling because Im so pissed at having a hard time understanding whats going on and looking at shitty buttons and numbers that dont have context I keep thinking what the hell is this number for I keep scrolling over stuff that I shouldnt have to when in civ 6 everything was just so obvious I always criticize people who announce that theyre quitting a game and here I am doing that very thing shame me But this is a little different I love civilization so much and Ive been defending it prerelease and I currently love the game too but the UI defeated me I thought people were exaggerating at how bad it is but Even as a lifelong fan from civ 1 the UI must be fixed before I return Rant over sorry Edit to clarify I refunded the game out of pure rage at the UI Maybe that was a bit of an emotional decision But Ill buy it again if they fix it,1,-0.9883,1

Without trying to start an argument here I love The Crown because I find their portrayals of the characters interesting In my opinion it doesnt paint them in a good light at all And I agree with that portrayal I am Irish after all and the royal family are not praised much over here But I see a lot of fansdefenders of the royal family on this subreddit and honestly Im surprised Are we not watching the same show I would see The Crown as having the message that the monarchy isnt needed But maybe Im biased What are your opinions on the royal family and how do they compare with how you view the shows portrayal of them Im not trying to cause an argument here I really just am surprised that most didnt have the same views as me after watching the show So I just want to hear others opinions,0,0.8237,1
Maybe Im being a bit too negative here Im watching episode 4x09 Ted Koppels Big Night Out the one where the Gilmores go to see the Yale vs Harvard football game And Richard just keeps going on about his time at Yale when him and his friends forced a guy out of his residence by basically bullying him every day when he said he was naked for basically all of his sophomore year in protest Then he joins in and sings songs with the current students at the game these men are in their 20s why is this random old man coming up to sing with them in a parking lot He is obviously longing for his old glory days at Yale It just reminds me of this awful pretentious old money frat boy toxic masculinity glory days mentality that prestigious universities give some people and makes me like Richard even less and my bar for Richard is very low already I think it just shines a light on the boys will be boys thing that was more prevalent back then although still is today I guess its not that deep but I just think hes a bit sad Edit I maybe am a bit dramatic in this post but I still stand by it I just think Richard trying to glorify his old immature ways shows a lack of character growth thats all I am sorry to anyone I have offended there is nothing wrong with loving your college its just Richard that I have an issue with,1,-0.5399,1
Having a bit of a moan Im incurable Not ideal it is what it is Anyway I have Ewings Sarcoma a relatively rare bone cancer that about 1 in a million people will be diagnosed with each year I hate when people tell me that I should have hope because science is always advancing or something and cancer treatments are always improving That may be true for common cancers but when you have a cancer as rare as mine it just isnt true They dont do enough research on it They dont have enough patients to do the research on it It really feels like rare cancer patients are left behind in the research because they are I guess Its not the fault of the researchers obviously youre going to work more on the cancers that affect more people It just sucks Anyone else with a rare cancer get told this Would love to hear others give out about it lmao,1,-0.9191,1
Hey everyone Ive been on treatment on and off for Ewings Sarcoma for a while now The chemo Im on now is kind of working kind of not And I have a feeling that Ill soon be changing treatments My doctors offered me some alternatives which seem fine But Ive read about treatments such as bulsafanmelphalan with a stem cell transplant and I have brought this up with him before but my doctor kind of just dismissed it and didnt give that good of a reason I was considering bringing it up again now that this chemo seems to not be working as well as hoped Of course I will get advice from my doctor on the matter but just wondering if anyone here has received this kind of treatment Honestly I kind of just would like to hear others experiences because its hard to find much detail about it online as its not the status quo of treatment Thanks,0,0.9237,1
Hi everyone Ive been having pretty bad back pain for a while but CT and MRI scans havent shown any cancer there So my oncologist put me on zoledronic acid to strengthen my bones because they think it could be due to bone loss I had my first dose of it on Tuesday along with my first dose of a new chemo and the next day my back was THROBBING I was feeling achey in my chest ribs and back My temperature was rising for a bit but then went back to normal eventually The pain felt very similar to the back pain i get when I take neulasta so thats what makes me feel like it was related to the zoledronic acid and not just my regular back pain And it feels now like I have a big knot in my midback that needs to be massaged Not fun Anyone else get side effects like these,1,-0.6032,1
So I just reviewed the notes from my MRI that I had on my arm Not only is the growth on my tricep a recurrence from the same spot it recurred twice before but the tumor that attacked my lymph nodes the reason why I was on chemo has also came back And now I have the new mets to the lungs as well I fuckin hate my life,1,-0.887,1

So Ive been looking into buying a smart watch to pair with my android phone I found this smart watch on eBay and I reached out to the seller to see if they could answer a few questions like can it act like an Apple Watch thats paired to an iPhone Meaning can it get notifications from other apps on my phone and display them on the watch can I make phone calls from the smart watch and get text message alerts on the watch as they come through from my android phone and lastly am I able to pair Apple Airpod Pros to the smart watch via Bluetooth Needless to say I havent gotten any response from the eBay seller so Im jumping on here to see if anyone else had any luck with it and could offer some helpadvice This smart watch is essentially a mini android phone from what I can gather so it shouldnt be an issue But still if anyone can offer any insight before I make the plunge that would be great Heres a pic of the smart watch in question,0,0.9665,1

Hello friends I just this last weekend attended a chöd empowerment offered through a Zoom livestream and I have a few simple practicalityrelated questions that I would like to ask the lamas Essentially I want to ask about the proper order of the practices The two organizations hosting the event Dharmata and the Abhaya Fellowship understandably dont have upfront ways of contacting the lamas How would you recommend reaching out to the teachers Should I include a written request with dana Reaching out through email or Facebook I want to be as respectful of their time as possible and avoid imposing on them If you have any experience with these organizations or teachers please let me know Edit If you have experience with these teachings and would like to offer advice please shoot me a PM,0,0.9371,1
Hey bros I did a scary thing today I broke up with a girl Im not very assertive especially in matters of heart so its kind of a big deal for me I dont know how to feel Weve been texting each other since March and it was really good for many months Recently though she pretty much quit texting me back and so even though she wasnt properly ghosting me I felt abandoned and unimportant I explained that it was causing me to struggle to stay happy and asked her for increased emotional intimacy but she replied that she was taxing herself too much to text me back every day and that she didnt have the interest or energy for increased intimacy her own mental health reasons That really hurt bros Im housebound from COVID and terminal cancer but thats not really the issue here and I struggle with the loneliness and isolation Whats worse is that we met though mutual best friends they all went to the same high school and I met our mutual friends in college so while Im not completely without a support system its complicated because Im afraid I cant vent my feelings honestly to my best friends I sat on it for a few days unable to decide if I wanted to go on a break her preference or break up entirely my preference I put it to her that I wanted to break up and she understood We talked just a little bit more about what went wrong between us and when she expressed a hope to remain friends and I said that I would like that after an appropriate healing period and no promises made Bros this was like two hours ago and Im already wracked with regret Im doubting myself hard When she ghosted me I would wait by the phone and simmer resenting her and desiring her with equal measure Now Im afraid that I actually would have been strong enough to go on a break and that I just threw away my last chance at romance bc cancer At the same time Im afraid that is we hadnt broken up I would have just repeated the same cycle of simmering waiting for her to warm up again I think I chose right I think Im just confusing the pain of separation with the pain of choosing wrongly I hate that I hurt her with our breakdown of communication months ago but also that I hurt her by choosing myself Im so frustrated but I dont think she and I can ever get to where we wanted to be I feel like we both let each other down I dont know if I want advice or comfort I just feel like I need another human to know whats up tonight I broke my own heart trying to save it Hope you bros can forgive my crytyping I love you bros Edit fixed a word,0,0.8359,1

This is something that occurred to me that I wanted to ask more for curiositys sake than need of guidance As I continue practicing meditation and studying the dharma I notice that Im more aware of whats happening in my mind and am better able to account for what Im experiencing This is the case for small mundane things as well as more significant glimpses into things like suffering For example simmering latent anger from traffic this morning still making me impatient with the dog or realizing that more dessert wont satisfy that subtle barelyperceptible dissatisfaction in my mind Obviously with annattaemptiness the self that is known here is false a fabrication But that leads me to my question has your progress on the path enabled you to know or to ignore your self more easily I see basis for both positions in the teachings of the dharma My impression is that as wisdom and insight increase one would better understand the processes and functions of mind which leads to a decrease in suffering at least in my limited personal experience My next impression is that the increase in selfawareness would lead to understanding of nonself as these mental patterns and formations become better understood What do you think Is knowing yourself of value for practice Has this been addressed in the textsscriptures Im not asking for guidance so much as just curious what people here think,0,0.9728,1
Ive taken to sleeping on the ground recently partially because my bed hurts my back and joints but also partially because its a recommended practice for the Uposatha days And hey cant forget to sleep on a low bed for the full moon if you sleep on a low bed for every stage of the moon Ive found that a memory foam pad underneath my sleeping bag greatly increases how comfortable I am and improves my sleep somewhat My question is this would the foam pad invalidate the idea of sleeping on the floor for the Uposatha How would something like a foam pad be evaluated in terms of the Vinaya I know that Im not a monk and therefore not bound by the Vinaya But IIRC it provides descriptions of the kinds of beds to be used by renunciates so I guess it would be a good measuring stick for this particular practice I believe the rule concerning beds is that it can be no higher than 8 fingerwidths off the ground which I assume is in reference to a wovenstyle bed on a wooden frame Im not necessarily worried about my bed necessarily breaking Vinaya rulesUposatha observances just curious about how the Vinaya would interpret my sleeping situation,0,0.943,1
Hey all Im in a bit of a bind in terms of access to the only drug that would ever help my cancer Some background I have an extremely rare and aggressive cancer possibly one of the most quicklygrowing and treatmentresistant solid tumors known to science Ive been on a clinical trial for a little over two years which thanks to the trial is abput 18 months longer than I was told to expect to live One sideeffect of my drug is that the enzyme which indicates heart muscle damage in healthy people troponin appears to be falsely elevated Or rather it is elevated without any evidence that there is actual damage to my heart it looks perfectly healthy on all the echocardiograms EKGs xrays you name it Because of this elevated chemical the drug company is preventing me from taking the drug and they refuse to give me permission to start again until the troponin level goes down All fine and good except that my levels have been elevated for a week now and we dont know if its going to go down again My doctor disagrees with the companys decision on this She feels that my cancer is a significantly greater risk to my health than a little heart damage and I agree with her I would rather live for longer with an imperfect heart than die in a few months with an intact heart Its about how you set your goals Im scared that by the time my levels dip down to normal my cancer will have started growing again Its been stopped in its tracks for most of the time Ive been on the trial but when it takes off again oh boy When the tumor was on my jaw it doubled in size every week So its a matter of getting the company to understand that my heart is less important here than my cancer and making them understand that prolonging my life is the goal we should be shooting for Has anybody had a situation like this Is there anything I can do to help my situation Or do I have to wait for some pencilpushers across the ocean to decide whether I die next month or next year Edit Thanks everyone for your concern and advice It turns out my doctor was secretly working on Compassionate Use paperwork but was kind enough not to get my hopes up while it was still in limbo If all goes according to plan Ill be using the drug on a compassionate basis in about a month,0,0.9596,1
Does anyone here have advice on strengthening your connection with yidams My teacher said something yesterday which motivated me to post Ive received and have been contemplating an extraordinary ngondro for about a year now and Im satisfied with how its going Something Ive been curious about though is the relationship with my yidam I can feel her presence when on the cushion and have an inkling of devotion for her off the cushion as well Should I strive to strengthen this feeling of devotion How would I go about it Offerings Remaining in that portion of the sadhana for longer Basically what should I be shooting for What is the kind of relationship I should cultivate towards the yidam Is my line of thought here misguided Is this something I should be thinking about at all Im open to any and all advice be it texts teachings or otherwise Additionally as always if the answer should be kept private you can PM me as well,0,0.9699,1
Hey all newbie here Ive made contact with a few teachers who belong to the same schoollarger organization and I hope to begin classes soon To my inexperienced eyes I get a mix of legitimate kung fu and McDojo vibes from their website The curriculum listed seems developed enough to suggest legitimacy and they have a section dedicated to lineage the style predates the Cultural Revolution but has been kept in the family until now On the other hand its suggested that one can work up to a black sash in at least three years for most skilled people and mention is made several times of the opportunity to become a teacher to share these teachings in America I live deep in the heart of the Midwest so I my choices arent necessarily abounding but I feel that their instruction will be legitimate enough that I can at least get a good basis for further training if the opportunity presents itself down the road The main question Im asking is this how can I identify quality in kung fu training What are the signs of legitimacy in curriculum and training If anyone has heard of them its the AmericanChinese Martial Arts Federation which teaches 8step Praying Mantis style Id like to add I mean absolutely no disrespect to any here who practice this style or are a part of the organization Id just like to understand how to evaluate quality in kung fu training The schools website can be found here EDIT fixed a word,0,0.9743,1
Hey all I posted a few weeks ago and I was pleased to have recieved a lot of reassuring responses about the legitimacy of my local kwoon I figured Id give you guys a little update The school seems legitimate and the teachers do too There are no overweight middleaged guys handing out blackbelts for a quick buck Heck I havent seen anyone wearing a belt at all The sifus explained that fitness requirements are part of advancement between sashes and they practice what they preach They do the aerobics with us during warmups Even more promising they come across as experienced in the teaching aspect of kung fu instruction I mean that theyre more than just advanced students theyve been taught how to teach Even outside of all yalls advice these are good signs that the school produces welltrained authentic instructtors Im looking forward to learning under their guidance I also wanted to share an achievement I can straightleg kick up to a 90degree angle Its not much I know but its a sign that Im making progress and that training is working Ive historically been very inflexible so seeing any change at all is heartening Every time I train the jumping jacks are easier my bow stance is steadier and my bodily control is smoother and quicker For the first time in my life Im loving being active Im really enjoying learning kung fu and looking forward to hanging out here while I do See yall around,0,0.9699,1
Kind of a second progress followup post but I just had a really satisfying training session and wanted to share I love kung fu Every day Im stronger and the movements are easier to do well Im starting to actually apply the instructions my sifus have talked about deeper stances better balance more fluid movements In addition to feeling better and being in allaround better shape Im starting to understand what the sifus say about learning and forming better qi patterns too Today when I was starting on body formations I stood up correctly kinda by accident and it almost crackled The balls of my feet connected with the earth and I felt the energy flow just like they say it does It was refreshing and I was able to keep a better balance and flow between the positions I hope this doesnt verge on mall ninja shit but my practice is starting to pay off and my enthusiasm seems to double each time I train I ended my session today with a grin ear to ear They wont always be euphoric like that but Im pumped about the changes learning kung fu has brought to my life and the ways itll continue to make it better,0,0.991,1
I think the purpose of this post is to see how far offbase my thinking is and to get feedback or see if anyone relates Background Ive considered myself a student of the Vajrayana specifically the Nyingma schools Dzogchen teachings for a little more than a year now The reason for secrecy around Dzogchen makes sense to me and I dont have a problem with that Potential students should be vetted Ive received pointing out instructions from two fairly wellregarded lamas one rather traditional and one very much not I think the pointing out instructions might have worked to some extent which leads me to my first question Can pointing out only kind of work Ive reached out to both lamas hoping to start a conversation about this Both times I got a rather lukewarm noncommittal answer which didnt help This has left me exasperated as to where I stand with either of the teachers On the one hand putting their instructions into practice hasnt yielded the breathtaking transformative experience that Dzogchen teachers speak of but on the other hand what Im experiencing on the cushion isnt nothing This has led me to begin exploring the ChanZen schools more closely I know that Are Dzogchen and Zen the same is a relatively common question asked here and its not necessarily my intent to raise that topic But Im aware that both traditions make a path out of first experiencing and then embodying Buddhanature or Tathagathagarbha Im curious to see if any can weigh in and see if Im completely wrong about my conclusions Meido Moore Roshis books have been my entry point and he explains that kensho the experience of Buddhanature can be either deep or shallow He continues to explain that once a student has had a kensho experience the teachers task is to provide practices which increase a students familiarity with it and make it easier to embody the experience off the cushion too So a relatively small kensho can be worked into a bigger kensho Can it work similarly in Dzogchen As I mentioned above my experiences have been more than normal wakingstate experience but less dramatic than how teachers describe it It doesnt seem to be a blackwhite binary but Ive tried to initiate conversations with both teachers and have been left feeling ignored I guess I really havent gotten the chance to explain this halfway position Im stuck in and thats what frustrates me Heres where I need feedback to see what I might be misunderstanding To bring this around to the rest of my questions I think the reason Im attracted to Zen is because it seems to have a larger window of admittance to practice In Dzogchen as well as Mahamudra you shop around for teachers taking pointing out instructions until you meet your root guru the one true teacher for your lifetime who cracks you wide open and gives you that full kensho experience I dont know if theres an equivalent Tibetan word for direct experience of Buddhanature and you study with them for at least the rest of your life In the Zen approach it seems to be less utterly dependent on the one teacher students can have deep or shallow kensho experiences on their own without having ever met their teacher However Moore Roshi explains that only a qualified teacher can confirm legitimate kensho and that true progress on the path can only occur under a teachers guidance So it seems that in Nyingma Dzogchen the path only begins with a big enough kensho experience of n 1 whereas in Zen the path can begin with a kensho experience of n 1 It seems that Zen embraces smaller kenshos and works up to bigger but that Dzogchen only recognizes a direct Buddhanature experience that is big enough breathtaking and transformative like teachers and masters describe I know this sounds crazy especially the mathematical language and Im not sure it works like this but hey thats why Im asking questions here So my final questions are Should I bother the lamas again and explain that I need better guidance Am I completely out of touch here All this has been the culmination of a period of questioning whether the Vajrayana is right for me and Im more and more seriously considering Zen I just dont know where I stand EDIT Forgot to mention a few things My intention is not to make anyone look bad or to badmouth any tradition Also I posted this here because I want the perspective of both Zen and Dzogchen practitioners Also I accept answersresponses in the PMs,0,0.9425,1

I was reading Omori Sogen Roshis Introduction to Zen Training and this passage resonated with something Im wrestling with in my practice now In his youth Baso did zazen diligently every day Seeing this Priest Nangaku Ejo asked Baso What do you expect to accomplish by doing zazen Baso answered I sit because I wish to become a Buddha He had forgotten that zazen itself is Buddhahood and was probably trying to become a Buddha through zazen To demonstrate his mistake the priest began to polish a roof tile vigorously while Baso was doing zazen Baso became puzzled and asked What are you doing Im thinking of turning this into a mirror replied Ejo Will a roof tile become a mirror if you polish it asked Baso Priest Ejo glared at and answered Can you become a Buddha by doing zazen Ejo continued his admonition You students are you trying to learn zazen or are you trying to learn sitting Buddhahood If you are learning zazen Zen is not sitting and lying down If you are learning sitting Buddhahood Buddha is not a fixed form According to the teaching of nonattachment or nonsettling down you should not try to adopt this or reject that You students if you try to become a sitting Buddha you kill the Buddha and if you become attached to sitting you will not reach that principle If we interpret this literally it probably means the following You students Are you trying to learn zazen or are you trying to become a Buddha If you are trying to learn zazen you must not be taken up by the form called sitting because Zen is something beyond sitting and lying down Again if you say you are trying to become a Buddha you cannot become a captive to the one set form called sitting because Buddha is something absolute Omori This passage occurs amid Omori Roshis discussion about correct motivation for Zen practice but for me it spoke to the subtle ways dualism can sneak into practice even when were trying our darndest to step outside the dualistic framework Something that becomes clearer each time I sit down to practice susokukan is the subtle notion of Oh here I am sitting I am meditating This is me transcending dualism Here I go Even though these ideas dont necessarily appear in my mind as verbal thoughts the dualistic idea that an individual self is sitting down to accomplish something is difficult to escape What I find particularly difficult is setting aside the tendency to evaluate how the sitting session is going The irony is that obsessively fixating on the quality of my sit oh this is going well Im doing it or bah youre undisciplined and lazy why else cant you do this one simple thing is absolutely whats distracting from successfully practicing susokukan Ejos point seemed poignant so I thought I would share it here,1,-0.5596,1

In all honesty not today but last weekend I had the opportunity to visit the local ish monastery and meet the Roshi there He invited me to join them for supper and the evening sits So for those of you who are not aware myself included Zen monasteries have very strict discipline in how you conduct yourself theres a way to stand up a way to sit down a way to walk and a way to stand A special way to do everything Oh and it should be done in complete silence too So naturally everything you do is highly ritualized which is the ideal environment for practicing meditationinmovement and for embarrassing the new guy Heres the FU Supper is no different you set out your row of bowls and wait in silence while the cook dishes out the food in what I assume is order of seniority Portion sizes are determined by a say when system but instead of using your voice you use a flick of your hand to tell them to stop dishing you food But they wont stop unless you flick your hand correctly So by the time I figured out what do I had a heaping bowl of white rice at least the size of a softball more than I could hold in my hands Supper is a silent affair but also a fast one You eat as quickly as you can in order to get back to the zendo and sit for a while before dokusan And nobody leaves until everybody is done So I was scarfing down my food as quickly as possible enjoying the pepper tofu stirfry and completely forgot about all the rice Which meant that once I had finished everything and everyone else was done I still had this massive bowlful of rice to work through Dry plain white rice And nobody goes back to the zendo until all the food is gone The brother in charge of discipline wont bend the rules for me its all gotta be eaten Just put as much in your mouth as you can he says Mind over matter So I do Im sitting there surrounded by five other fulltime practitioners in total silence while I try to shove as much rice in my mouth as I possibly can There is no sound in the room but the noises of me coughing and swallowing struggling to eat two meals worth of cereal grain with no water to wash it down There is nothing happening but me fighting myself trying to force my dry dry mouth to keep chewing bite after bite of plain rice For what felt like 10 whole minutes I became one with the embarrassment I know it took too long because when we got back to the zendo our butts were on the cusions for maybe two minutes tops before we got up and did walking meditation I was embarrassed for interrupting their schedules but at the same time I was cracking up at myself You always feel out of place when everybody else knows whats going on and this was no exception It was really a nonissue and definitely not the biggest faux pas that visitors have made but I felt so sheepish for taking too much rice and making it everybody elses problem Guess I gotta learn to say when sooner Really though they were all super welcoming and understanding Everyones patience while I bumbled around and struggled to match pace for walking mediation Rinzai goes fast and tripped over my legs trying to remember to bow leaving and entering the zendo really meant a lot to me Hopefully it goes smoother next time and I hope I gave them something to laugh about,0,0.9752,1
For the Americans here if you arent already planning to go protest please reconsider Their argument is that the reasoning behind Roe v Wade is flawed and they went out of their way to explicitly mention Obergefell v Hodges marriage equality and a handful of other cases which depend on the same reasoning This is not entirely correct see the edit below Even if you cant get pregnant show up for people who can Lend your voice loudly to the commotion This could very quickly become a and then they came for kind of thing Even if protesting doesnt help with this particular issue you will make more connections and friends in the movement Invest in the community We will need it if were going to weather the next few years EDIT Some commenters kindly pointed out my mistake in the above paragraphs I misread what my research had turned up and I apologize I posted the relevant selections in a comment below but I will put them here too From the opinion draft None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion They are therefore inapposite They do not support the right to obtain an abortion and by the same token our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in anyway and And to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion All that said please still show up for the protests and make it clear that the Courts rolling back of rights will not be tolerated The isnt necessarily beholden to us in the way Congress is but that doesnt mean making a lot of protest hurts anything either Remember Stonewall only worked because people backed Marsha up,1,-0.7991,1

New doom enthusiast I got into OM from the tranceraga side and dont listen to a lot of other metal but theyre my alltime favorite and Im going to go see them in a few months Ive never been to one of their shows or even a metal show at all so figured Id ask here Honest question what are the shows like I know they give an awesome performance but whats the vibe Are people up and moving around or is it a muted navelgazing energy Should I dress up like Burning Man,0,0.9754,1

Hey bros Thanks for listening Im working on being better at emotional intimacyhonesty with my loved ones but I reproach myself for depending on them I know this is cultural baggage from toxic masculinity but how do I balance getting my needs met without demanding too much from them Especially since Im having mental health difficulties and my needs are elevated at the moment How can I tell when its a legitimate need vs depending on outside validation Im a few weeks into my therapy journey and its going well Forcing myself to regularly take stock of what Im feeling and comparing it day to day is beginning to help me understand a lot of whats going on in my mental landscape I used to have a large circle of friends but as Ive gotten older its become a small circle of deep highquality friendships My understanding is that this is normal Im also talking to a person Id like to see as a partner one day She feels similarly As I become more aware of whats happening in my head Im starting to notice some patterns around emotional intimacy and leaning on my social circles for support Ill want to send a meme or a cute flirty message or ask if someone wants to hang out on a phone call and immdiately start kicking myself My bad selftalk will say youre always bothering them or theyre not messaging back because you said soandso I understand that bad selftalk is a dynamic in my head and Im starting to get better at identifying it But its also confusing me and making it hard to trust whether what Im asking of my friends is reasonable or not On the flip side theres an awareness that others have their own lives and needs with limited time and resources Theyre my friends and they love me but its also not their job to supply me with happygoodtimes thats a skill I need to continue working on But how do I know when that impulse for selfreliance is a measured consideration of others and when its mental health toxic masculinity telling me to man up and not bother anyone with your shit,0,0.9879,1

I need a little more cushion than the standard 3mm Gaiam bangers you find at Walmart but a cushy 34 mat makes keeping a solid base tricky I went to Target and got a 5mm mat AllInMotion Premium What I like about it is that the top is a firmer plastic that feels almost like woven jute It allows for a more solid base and provides the perfect amount of cushion for me However as soon as my skin touches it I feel a little perspiration and I start to slip and slide around Its so bad I cant even do downward dog I have to fire my core muscles to maintain anything like the proper shape Does anyone have experience with this mat or suggestions for grippier similar ones Can I do anything to increase the grip of the surface Buff it down with sand or hotwaterwash off a protective coating I like the firmness and feel but dont want to build up incorrect muscle habits Thanks,0,0.9537,1

Hey friends I want to make a daily ritual of journaling and taking stock of my emotions but Im not sure when I should fit it into my schedule Im to the point of therapy where your head finally breaks above water and the deep dark of it fades away Psychologybased selfhelp literature have been really helpful as has spending time taking stock of my emotions and journaling The trouble is Ive been squeezing reflectionjournaling time in whenever I can and Id like to cement it into my daily schedule a little more Its a bit of a strange question but Im looking for your experience and suggestions and feedback If youve got a journaling habit when do you work it into your schedule Have you found that it works better at certain times of the day I already meditate in the mornings and afternoons and practice yoga just before supper Im unemployed at the moment because of some longterm health issues so my schedule is very flexible The idea is to make this part of my day into a habit so that I can track my emotional health from day to day and so that I always stay on top of it,0,0.9519,1
Im in pain and it fucking sucks you guys They took me off treatment for an extra week to radiate an honestly inconsequential tumor While I was off treatment the tumor in my spine started growing Its pushing on my spinal cord and practically tap dancing on my femoral nerve So my leg hurts A lot But what really really pisses me off is that I cant sit on my comfy cushion to meditate The angle and the pressure on my back and thigh makes the nerve pain in my leg absolutely sing Cold fire from knee to hip It makes concentrating difficult much less finding any peace And Im so mad cause meditation is the most important thing I do in a day I have all this freetime to dedicate myself towards the spiritual practice that gives my life meaning but I cant put it in practice for longer than 7 minutes at a time Sometimes it feels like Im cursed It feels like god or whatever is singling me out Like as soon as I find a source of joy or meaning this fucking cancer finds a way to get in its way After diagnosis I spent three years unsubconsciously fearing my body Because of yoga and meditation I started loving it again And then this shit comes up and makes me start hating it all over again Im not tired Im just pissed Im normally a happy person and thats the biggest casualty of my cancer I can have good and happy days but it takes so much goddamn work I just wanna wake up and drink my coffee I just wanna cultivate a little peace in the time I have left,1,-0.9771,1
I just finished the first book and while I really enjoyed it Im left feeling like the story petered out in the last hundred pages Really I felt that the entire Part Three The Prophet was disappointing and I think its cause Herbert didnt write the story I was expecting Ill try to avoid spoilers but the ending of the first novel makes it almost an entirely political story Aside from the unique political power of his station as Muaddib Pauls alliance with the Fremen his journey of becoming Fremen is basically irrelevant to how he resolves the conflict of the book He could have achieved a similar result through any other kind of political arrangement with the Fremen prophetical powers notwithstanding I guess its just puzzling to me that Herbert skipped over what I would consider the most interesting parts Fremen culture and religious life Things like the mysteries of the Makers the wisdom gleaned from the hard balance of life in the desert what it means to be a part of that environment ecologically as well as spiritually It just seems like Herbert teedup all this fascinating stuff and then skipped it Literally skipped it Pauls entrance into Fremen culture is breezed over in a timeskip Maybe I just got the wrong impression from how the franchise is being marketed I tend to gravitate towards science fictionfantasy that has spiritual themes and undertones and I thought Dune was the holy grail I know the story Herbert tells is far from over and that there are a lot of books but is there more of what Im looking for in later books I can appreciate a certain depth of worldbuilding but if Im looking for a story about culture and religion that goes beyond just their significance in politics will I be rewarded by reading more of the Dune universe,0,0.9881,1

Zen lurker here Ive been playing with introducing chant into my practice and have been wanting to memorize the Heart Sutra which in turn has me curious about the contexts where its mantra is used Most other mantras are associated with a specific deity Avalokiteshvara Guru Rinpoche Tara etc and chanting the mantra establishes a connection between you and the deity But the Heart Sutra mantra isnt connected to a specific deity AFAIK unless everybody has been ignoring for a long time So what does the Heart Sutras mantra do Why and when do people use it,0,0.9287,1
Has anyone else had weird phlebitis that seemed to get worse over time I got my second round of chemo cisplatinetoposide around 10 days ago all three infusions in my right forearm Now I have firm tender bumps in what I think are my veins The GP I saw said phlebitis and told me to treat with baby asprin and warm compresses but that was a few days ago Now there are two more bumps in the original vein and one larger one in an adjacent vein Anyone else had this Im not terribly concerned but its just weird and I dont know what to do,0,0.6894,1
Bit of an odd question here has anyone had yoga help with spinal cord compression Will my slightly weaker right leg be stabilized and strengthened with time Ive got cancer with some metastases in my spine One of them appears to be eversoslightly pressing on my spinal cord enough so that Ive got a mild case of nerve pain So far I havent noticed any loss of function with my leg but when Im on the mat particularly towards the end of the practice I notice the affected leg is a little weaker I have more shake compared to the other side and I cant hold a given position quite as long Does anyone have any experience with neurological issues like weakness improving Any advice Im hoping that the strength and bodyintegration can even out the imbalance between my two legs,0,0.3351,1
So as far as I can grasp entirety of the Path is to punch through to emptiness and see your true nature then practice deepening and living in that mindstate until you become a buddha But what exactly is the mechanism by which that eliminates suffering Is it just that when youre awake to reality emptiness you dont identify with the things that made you suffer before Or that you have the freedom to choose not to Edit to add This is all rather abstract But how can zazen and its insight end my suffering in this life too,1,-0.9032,1

I was paralyzed in early October and Im just now getting around to feeling like meditating and pursuing spiritual work again But sitting is forever changed for me because my legs dont work Getting down and up off the floor isnt really possible anymore What do other wheelchair users do Should I get a big ottoman Should I invest in a lift for getting down to the floor What about just a good padded bench I can probably make my wheelchair itself work well enough but I liked having a designated space For that matter space is another issue My bedroom is now on the ground floor of the house and its partially a shared space the rest is my dads office What are some options to set aside a little space in a room thats already hurting for extra space How can I transform a multiuse corner of my bedroom into my meditation area Im thinking of getting a thangka and hanging that to demarcate that this is a special area but I need to store other things in that space too Tips and suggestions especially those from wheelchair users and other disabled folks are welcome TIA,0,0.9776,1
I seem to remember either Messiah or Children mentioning that for people with some limited prescient abilities it sort of pushes them over the edge and awakens this or helps them to see But since a geriatric isnt a real class of drug it got me wondering what melange does for people without any such ability whatsoever My mind goes to Stilgar for example He seems excessively grounded in the present moment of reality I doubt that hes got much for prescient ability So what would melange do for him As a sort of related question why do the classic Fremen that is of MuadDibs time put spice in everything I understand that for Leto II theyre trying to overload him but whats the purpose of making coffee with the most valuable substance in the universe especially since I assume most people are like Stilgar Is it to keep people slightly entranced all the time Perhaps I missed something basic in the first book I remember struggling so much to get my mind around Herberts world that I think I need to give Dune a reread But maybe yall can answer this in the meantime TIA,0,0.63,1

Im about to start this unexpected battle I never thought I be in I am looking for hope from other who have fought and won I need to know their is hope that I can neat this Im trying looking across the country to figure out what doctor or clinic will actually try to save my life I have a 2 year old some and I want to be here and help him become a man If you did become cancer free tell me what you did and what treatments you did Im looking for help Please help me fight sp I can see my little boy grow up I know its going to be a very hard fight but I know its possible I met people who have beat it Please give me your story of how you won,0,0.9394,1
So I was diagnosed in June and this is really hard I keep telling myself I can beat this I have mets in lung and liver around 6 total in lungs and 5 spots on liver I responded well to treatment with was capox the first rd then capavastin My oncologist doesnt want to do surgery I scheduled a thoracic surgeon appointment Monday in another state he also does lung suffision So Im going to talk to him because the one thing I need to have a chance to beat this is surgery It sounds like the thoracic surgeon wants to do surgery and if thats the case Im going to do it I am trying really hard to fight and try to become cancer free I want to see my son grow up to a man and grow old with my wife and I just have to try do whatever it takes ro beat this,1,-0.1709,1
So my oncologist doesnt want to do surgery but I spoke to a thoracic surgeon named DrTodd Demmy to see if he will do my surgery and from are initial call ir seems he wants me up there for a visit Then I need a liver surgeon Im thinking Dr Wong Im truly scared if Im being honest I dont want to die I have my first child 2 yrs old a baby boy like I always imagined and wanted now the thing hat I wanted for so long likely to be very shortened Im trying my best to find a way to get ned as I heard alot of people with my diagnosis beat cancer after being told inoperable 2 weeks to live maintaience therapy yet they decided to get aggressive and find surgeons who will operate etc Im going to do all that and I feel like I can beat this But I think realization is setting in that I will likely not win or the odds are not in NY favor I had 1 rd of capox very effective now Im doing avastin and capecitabine My oncologist said no surgery because since itd in the liver and lungs but Ive seen many people here get several resection so I decides to go to Rosewell with Dr Todd I going to do the surgery regardless of what my primary oncologist says His goal is just maintaience I am 5 months diagnosed and the idea of not being here with my wife who I had been with since I was 20 and she was 19 My son my dear boy I want to see him grow Im trying to stay faithful that Im going to beat this but its hard Please anyone who has had my diagnosis mets lungs and liver I need you to give me strength to fight this please I need to hear this isnt a waste of time and that fighting can actually change the precieved outcome My goal plan is cure I dont care that Im stage 4 Im going to try and find surgeons willing to try though who are known to be good and aggressive Please I need postivrw stories from people with my diagnosis Pray for me,0,0.9815,1
So I have lined up a thoracic surgeon and a liver surgeon I hope the liver surgeon has a Dr who can do my colon as well I spoke to DrDemmy Todd and I sent him my scan and from the talk he wanted to have a appointment so we can talk about surgery I meet with my liver surgeon next week who is aggressive so Im that after he sees my scans that he will do surgery or give me a road map to being a candidate I was going back and forth on if I should wait until my 2nd scans to look to try to get surgery as my oncologist did I was inoperable I know that can change but after talking to surviors they all wanted surgery found surgeons who would do it and now they are cured Please have me in your thoughts that I find Drs who are willing to do the surgeries I really think i will and I honestly feel like I will beat this if they can just get this crap out of my body I know a recurrence is possible but I truly feel I can beat this if I have surgery,0,0.9052,1

Ive known this person for more than three decades Weve been through a lot togetherboth good and bad Ive witnessed several of his downfalls and hes often been called selfish by nearly every partner I saw him hit rock bottom The family context is complex but now that Ive been diagnosed with ADHD in I see things a bit differently We talked about the changes and he also has ADHD hes currently undergoing treatment for another neurological disorder that had a huge impact on him in the past Ive taken some of his words to hearthis justifications for certain actionsand I realize he might not see that hes falling into the same patterns He tries to do his best for everyone making decisions that affect others while assuming everyone will be okay with it because the people involved get along But when things go wrong he becomes overwhelmed with guilt and anger He feels like everyone is against him I think hes masking the fact that hes doing whats easiest for him trying to please everyone I told him that good intentions still have consequences and facing them is part of the process Its important to put yourself in others shoes beforehand to avoid these situations Not everyoneno matter how cool they aresees things the way he does Its frustrating to hear him complain and its hard for me to tell him that hes also responsible Its not just that the world is unfair and that hes always the victim,1,-0.2871,1

My 2nd mastectomy is going to be on Oktober 18 Some days I almost forget sometimes I become very anxious thinking of the upcoming surgery I remember how painful it was the first time and how I was surprised about that fact I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder against hospitals I take meds I have therapy sessions weekly and a group session which is also weekly So Im doing whatever I can to make it easier I dont know how I manage those things because actually Im very depressed at the moment You guys have any advice on what to pack in your hospital bag for a mastectomy,1,-0.8439,1

Hello all I recently purchased the Arctic Nova Pro wireless headset for my PC Beyond happy with this product in terms of audio quality and comfortability However the last few days I have noticed an uptick in Audio distortion while playing games after diving deep into reasons that it could be Ive read that the 24GHz frequency could be getting interrupted with your phone being close by modem router being in the same room which it is and if this is the case to go within your router settings and disable 24GHz However the only inconvenience with that is my Samsung TVs are wirelessly connected via 24G WiFi along with my houses security system thermostat etc so you can see my issue Has anyone else found a resolution or a way around this,0,0.5423,1

can you imagine if you went to an AA meeting and it was mostly family members of alcoholics speaking what if half the people at every meeting came to announce that their loved one died from alcoholism gave the graphic details of how awful it was and then left and addiction is not a choice but in this case even with meetings and strength and support I cant avoid dying from my disease I never realized everything centered around other peoples experience with cancer you cannot easily find a support group for people who only have cancer how odd is that when you have cancer I suppose everyone is your caregiver is my mom still my caregiver she works so I mostly threw up by myself all day while on radiation she makes my step dad dinner every night hes healthy is she his caregiver she washes his clothes and goes shopping for him am I inherently more burdensome because Im ill was I my grandmothers caregiver when I just visited her and hung out some are really caregivers of course but the term is overused imo some people are relatives or friends I am taking care of myself Im left to fend for myself Ive learned that cancer is a balancing act of what to say dont talk about the bad side in a cancer support group or with friends or with strangers thats negativity your suffering is scaring people no one likes to think about that grief posting is fine though cancer is sad and people have to get it off their chest I have watched people so many times tell those with cancer that they need to stop crying they need to get a grip and grow up and move on I dont advise that we should all wallow in it but when are the grieving supposed to move on do you respond the same way to them I read that said someone was my age and they felt it was not fair that their loved one was dying after all they said they were only my age not supposed to lose a loved one when youre that young their life is over its unlived I dont disagree its very sad and needing of support somewhere but its an interesting thing to read when you are the same age the one who will die relatively soon the one who will not live that life and are regularly told your life is not over stop saying it is you are making a big deal out of things why are you even sad about this you need to move on and pretend you are not dying until you do die When I posted about how I do not feel particularly lucky to be dying at the same age I got a response that duh stupid cancer patient they are saying you are lucky that you will not die in 3 weeks be grateful Im simply surprised that attitude is not extended to those who are not ill at all most days I hate that cancer is such a cultural Thing I struggle to think of the perfect analogy I dont know if there is one but people die parents die grandparents die Im not arguing that it isnt terrible and upsetting but it is odd to me that people with a disease have to exist in spaces where people are allowed to flit by and say x died from this specific thing and it was so terrible your disease is terrible and deadly dont people regularly complain of saying omg x died of cancer why is it so different in a support setting where most are vulnerable patients are not handled with the same kid gloves when they are it is seen as unfair coddling to those around them seen as exclusionary everyone has a right to be as involved in your cancer as you are and if you have a complaint a rant the classic line they only want the best my mom today complained about how my grandmothers oncologist spent all his energy on the patients I had a bit of an internal laugh about that one I know that its awful to have a loved one die and I know caregiving is not easy but you dont know what its like unless you have it you dont have the right to say treatment is easy when you havent been through it Ive been called cruel for literally simply speaking about a grim and deadly disease and saying that treatment is in fact not fun or easy by someone who did not have said disease Im certainly aware that its grim though if I called my own disease that I am sure I would get many responses that stats are outdated and useless and I may live forever my question there is this if treatment is so easy and painless why do you describe yourself as a caregiver do healthy non suffering people need caregivers if survival rates are so outdated and do not apply to anyone why are you mourning in advance if having cancer is so terrible for everyone around me why is it not terrible for me to have it I remember being a very depressed young teen and having a really dark thought I wish I had cancer I wish people understood I was suffering If I had some illness they would understand they would empathize with me It wouldnt all be in my mind As I grew up I mostly realized that was bs But you really dont realize how lonely cancer is until you have it some days I miss being alone in my suffering without people thinking they understood and speaking on my behalf I dont disagree that caregivers ever come to cancer spaces fwiw I appreciate when people are seeking to help a loved one with diet choices or pain relief And I understand that its devastating to watch someone go through something terrible there definitely needs to be support for all My dad is disabled and suffering and thinking of it makes me instantly cry I do things for him a lot I just cannot imagine going to an amputee support group and going up to the mic and saying hey so I still have all my limbs but I just wanted to explain that watching you go through this is really hard for me It makes me very miserable to think about how you guys are suffering I also know someone who died from amputation and it was very terrible to watch But you guys should be strong and get through this Im here to answer questions because actually my dad had it really easy he never even cried to me Ta idk as Ive said I dont think we should be told to wallow in our misery but I often feel pretty gaslighted if everyone around me is suffering by virtue of watching me suffer how am I lucky are they not lucky too after all their loved one could die in 6 months some have 3 weeks pick your head up I feel like if I said that to the grieving parent Id be pretty immediately knocked down a peg and rightly so I doubt anyone will read this all and if anyone does Im sure I will be met with a lot of disagreement but whatever Im grateful for the kind people Ive met this isnt particularly coherent because I have so many thoughts on it all I speak for myself but I will say I find it funny that if you go to a chat people will largely say they do not check support groups anymore I just wanted to say my peace before I prob leave this area or take a break at least because no place feels made for patients at all Maybe thats cruel But cancer is cruel and a very lonely thing no matter how many people are around you and no matter how badly theyre suffering,1,-0.9997,1
I posted on the gen cancer board but forgot that every time I rant there the same person blames me for everything I honestly do just want someone to be like wow that sucks Im sorry for you instead of telling me everything is my fault idk who will read this and im probably going to cringe later but im upset lol Ive been struggling so much trying to get psych care I got diagnosed with GBM in yes its the good kind and Im not dead yet but it feels like my own body is trying to kill me because it is and I feel trapped and really broken by all the treatment and just Tired a nurse who Im friendly with she isnt in oncology but I see her for something else asked if I would do optune or similar when I have recurrence and I was just like I am so goddamn miserable as it is I cannot imagine even doing the treatment I did before again let alone that Im not really worried about recurrence as a general thing but if I had one tomorrow I think I might be brave enough to be like fuck no youre not dragging me through this again Its been ridiculously hard to find a doctor I had one at the cancer center who barely did anything for me anyway tbh but at least we tried some new meds then he randomly sent a letter saying he left anyway and then the new one isnt covered under my insurance naturally I understand my cancer center not being able to help in a different state but a palliative expert neuro oncologist being like haha well good luck with that about finding psych help makes me cry to think about like its really a joke to everyone maybe because Ive been sad for so long they just dont think its a major issue but like I just feel worse and worse and no one gives a fuck unless they can operate on me everyone says to ask for help even me I tell people that and then I cant even get myself a single psychiatrist appointment after six months I was so proud of myself for finally telling my cancer center how bad I felt and I felt totally dismissed today I was so relieved we finally seemed to get through to the right place and it turned out the doctor referred me for some speech therapy type exam not counselingpsychiatry and theyre like again its a really long wait at what point do I not have to wait like I literally do not want to be alive and have access to medicine fairly regularly and I HAVE been waiting for six months im sick of the distress forms and the pain scales and making it clear that i dont like being alive and i wish i wasnt and then when you ask for help theyre like well its apparently such a long wait that we cant even give you a date i wonder who actually gets in or maybe terminal just puts me at the back of the line bc they figure ill die anyway i literally WANT to live my life and do better and go to school or something but i cant do that when im so depressed and anxious and tired and unfocused im just trying not to kms in the meantime while someone decides its my turn im just so tired sorry I wish people just sympathized instead of telling me that its my fault and that I have to suck it up because everyone else is dealing with the same thing i think no not everyone is dealing with the same thing i feel so isolated and like alienated and even if im not the only one which i know im not it doesnt mean it doesnt suck to be like begging for help and everyone is just living their life it feels so awkward even saying i have cancer like as if ive done something wrong idk if im supposed to call the place now and rant that i need help Now or if they wont even listen to that if I call about my shoulder replacement I can have an appointment in 3 days but you hate your life and cant even get an appointment in like a year apparently i dont know what the hell to do to make doctors listen that i CANT wait anymore,1,-0.9942,1
feel like Im saying it all the time here lol but I have a brain tumor the thing is the prognosis is bad and I just get flat shut down by people when I talk about it I keep deleting a whole very long paragraph about the stats bc its so hard to summarize but basically its for it to not come back at all the outlook is generally not good for me and this is not a case of stats being very outdated when standard of care for this has not changed in 20 years its still being debated if they should even bother giving people like me the standard of care chemo an even newer debate is if there was even a point of me taking the chemo during radiation so yeah recurrence in 5 years or so 2 now doesnt directly mean death sentence I have friends who have made it through one but its still really bad not a lot of options beyond hoping its not a lot worse and you can get it with surgery and thats just ignoring treatment symptoms and focusing on actual time left whats frustrating is most of the time I feel SO alone because its like no one will acknowledge this even if I talk about it I dont want to be reminded daily that Im kindofdying but Im also frustrated at feeling idk the word gaslighted comes to mind even though I dont want to misuse that but close like as in I know the facts yet people esp my mother go so hard just telling me youre wrong youre wrong its fine youre going to live forever those stats arent real and Im a little like oh am I crazy like I think Im terminal but honestly I also feel like I dont even know terminal means likely to die right and I am I believe and everything says that but also people make me think Im somehow wrong even when I know the info like I cant confidently make a statement as if Im somehow misreading its crazy bc if a caregiver for this speaks in brain cancer groups then suddenly oh its really scary and terrible and death comes on so fast and no one survives this and blah but if I talk as a patient oh well you know be positive about it its all fine even when I ask my onc any q along the lines of survival I feel like it annoys him that Im being negative thats prob largely my own self consciousness but it just feels like no one wants to talk about how bad it is unless its a caregiver oriented discussion in which case oh its dark as hell like somehow I have a cancer where when opting for a hip replacement the doctor is like oh um this is personal but is there like a prognosis and nurses and PAs and whoever cant hide their shock or sadness or we when I say it where any support group they have to explicitly be like pls stop posting pics of your relatives on their deathbed yet everythings definitelyyyyyy going to be fine idk this is so long though I tried to make it not if anyone reads and has any words Id appreciate it I guess like does anyone feel similar or get it Im just tired of feeling crazy tbh like honestly I know there are worse things but I feel like I dont even get the default omg cancerterminal pity its like oh Im delusional for being sad which makes the sadness worse not like I want to live every moment thinking about dying thats part of why i take breaks from here etc but idk I do have a psychiatrist whos trying meds for me but Ive been on a therapy waitlist for several months lolllll apparently being idkamiterminal doesnt bump u forward or anything I already have to deal with like getting my GED and maybe a job and away from my parents or something knowing its probably not even going to last itd just be nice to have like understanding kindness tbh instead of the positivity that makes me doubt my whole reality yes ik I may live 20 years but for one thing Im 23 and my parents are in their 60s so 20 isnt making me feel super hype sorry but even then 20 isnt likely at all and I just feel exhausted w people not or pretending they dont understand that,1,-0.9815,1
idk I just need to share this where a couple people will listen because damn I hate US healthcare and not having support IRL whenever I mention cancer anywhere else its silence doctor today explains my bone is like almost broken due to steroids they gave me for my brain cancer so yeah this is about cancer unfortunately nothing to say it wont collapse soon but for now its not doesnt really matter to me because it feels just the same as it did when it was entirely fractured they cant give a shot to relieve pain because that will collapse it and make it emergent which I logically understand what hes saying but also I can barely walk it is already kind of emergent to me hi only solution is surgery he suggests keeping activity low I say I can barely get out of bed I have no activity level hes just like they scheduled surgery for dec and told me that everywhere in the area was booked too and that even the december 20th date would most likely get moved out to january or later had to sit there sobbing in front of two med students while we scheduled that spicing up their ortho rotations for sure not that I wouldnt be upset about that too but they didnt even bother telling me to try OTC pain meds or something asked if theres anything at all they can do for the pain and he was like nope I just get to deal with it LOVE TO need to have insurance pay well over 40k for a hip replacement ANDDDDD wait several months last time insurance sent me a letter saying if I didnt prove the surgery wasnt due to a car accident etc then Id owe like 48k immediately thank god we dont have scary socialized medicine I know they cant control scheduling but its just infinitely upsetting to me that everyone is so eager to keep the fking tumor from killing me but if I rate my pain level at an 8 and I have had a hip replacement brain surgery I know what pain is by now theyre like well idk sorry we can maybe help you next year if you are miserable in the mean time we cant even give you a pill or something Then he told me to have a nice summer lol I cant help but feeling like its worse because its just me saying Im hurting vs a bone sticking out you know I feel like I broke my arm and theyre telling me well you can consider a cast but we cant do it until January and we cant give you pain meds Im terminal I just want to not be in pain lol everyone including this doc today keeps telling me omg youve been through so much and its like yeah can I at least have some pain relief then lol my mom kept basically telling me to calm down about it and was joking with the doctor like okay I get that we cant do the surgery right now because I must be actually cursed but can I not be in pain Im so tired of being in pain every day I can barely even walk at all its like cancer wont stop ruining my life and everyone thinks Im fine because the tumor isnt there but life feels worse than when I had the damn tumor because at least with that people kind of cared if I felt awful,1,-0.1152,1
hi again actual good news this time lol they moved my surgery up to january 30th since the last time I got a THR at this hospital they got the mako stryker robot they said its going to assist in what the surgeon does Ill get a CT scan sometime soon and theyll use the robot to make everything a bit more precise for hopefully an easier recoverybetter results though my last THR has been good so far I did have a harsh recovery but I finished chemo the month before that so not surprising that was posterior otherwise normal THR no robot just wondering if anyone has any recovery experience with this kind how easy was it Im 24 and I guess average health not really looking to be discouraged from this route or anything because I do trust this surgeon and just want it done asap but ik people here usually have things to share Ive read a lot of stories about posterior in general but idk if anyone has had the robotic and thinks that made a significant difference thanks,0,0.9604,1
I guess just wondering if I am alone in this and if Im not if anyone has had luck with coping Im sitting in the ER and im trying not to cry because i know it will make me feel worse but my hip replacement hurts i cant take my oxy because itll be wasted and i need my aspirin twice a day as a blood thinner but i threw it up twice today migraine wont go away because i cant hold down water or take meds i feel so short of breath and my heart is racing not asking for medical advice like that bc im at the ER already i couldnt cope but sometimes it just feels like im such a baby now i had brain surgery and 4 joints replaced i should be able to handle vomiting and migraines right but they all feel like an 8 or 9 to me idk if i am over sensitive or it just hits me harder but im too weak as a person to deal its like every surgery recovery i do pretty bad too idk i guess this is mostly a vent too so thanks if you readsay something kind im just tired i feel like my brain tumor iss the thing causing the least problems now its just my body hates me and i cant deal with being sick my mom offered to take me to the ER because she couldnt see me like this I was here just earlier this month too im sure theyll be annoyed but i feel so bad and couldnt try out new meds while waiting to get my bone fixed,1,-0.7163,1
I asked The Question again today not really expecting a very specific answer and my doctor told me he thinks theres like a 1 in 3 chance mine comes back in like the next ten years at this point since Ive been lucky enough to not have it back yet I started sobbing in the car tbh and my mom was like what are you all upset about I said what do you think And she went but you already knew it was like this thanks yes I knew it was bad 4 years ago but it still sucks and its like it ruined my life or at least my 20s and now Im supposed to be happy that I maybe wont die til Im like 35 I get to stress about moving out of my parents place and getting a job all very socially late lol just in time to lose it I feel so alone in this its like it physically hurts sometimes side note does anyone else constantly get told by nurses omg youve been through so much along with the shocked and sad faces and pity I dont necessarily find it offensive because I realize theyre trying to be empathetic but I feel so frustrated with this disconnect this oncology nurse spends five minutes gasping about how pitiful my life is and then everyone around me irl wont even ask me if Im okay idek,1,-0.8933,1

February 19 On February 14th I was officially one year cancer free Its a big deal I know but hold your applause It was a date I almost missed a date that went along without any pomp or circumstance because I am not better Dont panic This isnt a post to let you all know that Ive relapsed again or that some other scary disease Im looking at you UCLA superbug has taken over my body This is a post to talk about something Ive mentioned before but definitely not enough Being cancer free does not mean being better On February 3rd I woke up at 6am because I couldnt breathe Id had a sore throat for a few days that Id been ignoring but that morning I had no choice but to acknowledge that something was wrong There was a pain in both my lungs so sharp that it was almost impossible for me to get in any air I took my temperature I called my cancer center who told me to call an ambulance I called for the first time in my life surprising I know and was taken to the closet ER Here I need to go off track for a moment and talk about how privileged I have been to have received treatment from some of the top hospitals in the world Ive always known how lucky I am to be treated in world class hospitals by doctors who are not just brilliant but kind doctors who listen to their patients In the ER of a downtown Los Angeles hospital which Im not naming because I dont want to get sued or something I dont know how this works I received a sharp awakening call I told them my medical history all while still fighting to breathe and explained that something similar had happened before and that a very specific pain medication would eradicate the problem long enough to start looking for what was wrong with me They ignored me I listened to them repeat my medical history incorrectly she had some kind of transplant they removed a tumor from her chest without the breath to correct them I sat in a hallway while patients with various illnesses walked around me and no one offered me a mask despite my insistence that I have an autoimmune disorder When my IV was accessed the nurse didnt cap it properly and blood poured from the tube until I brought it to his attention When my regular oncologist found out where I was he told me to tell them I was feeling better so I could be discharged immediately and to come to the center at Cedars The doctor wrote me a prescription for a fucking ZPAK and sent me on my way I made it to my hospital and have never been happier to see such friendly competent faces People who know me and care about me I will never stop reiterating how grateful I am to these men and women who take such good care of me I was given the proper medicines admitted to the hospital and eventually diagnosed with RSV a respiratory virus only children get my immune system still isnt fully grown up yet I was in the hospital just over a week missing 7 classes But then came the fun part recovery Because when you leave the hospital you arent just better For 3 days I sat in bed watching Netflix while Ben my wonderful wonderful boyfriend made me soup and brought me tissues and let me cry when I got frustrated because just walking to the kitchen felt like running a half marathon We had plans to go to Palm Springs that weekend for Valentines Day and despite my poor health we decided to keep those plans My doctor even said as if I were a s housewife that a break from all the smog and stress of the city would be wonderful for my health So we went And we came back And I still wasnt able to go to my classes this week And that is where things get tricky Being better is all about perception A weekend in Palm Spring should mean Im well right I posted pictures of us laying by the pool we even went out to dinner one night I must be fine But thats not how it works That hour by the pool was the only time I got out of bed that day and after dinner After dinner I had to wait in the car while Ben made a Ralphs run because I felt like I was going to pass out if I walked more than 20 steps I have a bad habit of posting my good days on social media Or maybe its a good habit because I post the days I want to remember But the problem is that every day is not an Instagram post Ive had to bail on birthday dinners and friendly brunches because I literally cant get out of bed without falling over and Ive gotten responses like you were fine last weekend or you seemed okay when you were drinking that sangria the other night Some days I wake up and feel great and go for a jog Im kidding that part never happens and make it to all my classes and do all my homework and have dinner with friends and pay all my bills on time but some days I wake up and everything hurts and just getting out of bed to pee feels like the hardest thing in the world So no I am not better Im posting today because all of this really came to a head this morning I was planning on going back to classes today I even made an appointment to meet with one of my professors before class Dane if youre reading this Im sorry and Im emailing you next I didnt get as much work done as I wanted to yesterday but I was still feeling okay I woke up early to do some more this morning and about an hour in I started to panic What if it wasnt enough What if I never caught up What if I tried to walk to class and passed out on the way because I hadnt tried walking that far yet What if I passed out IN class What if something happened and I wound up back in that emergency room And so I had a panic attack I cried in the shower for 15 minutes and tried to calm myself down but I couldnt breathe and couldnt make it stop so I took a xanax and just kept shaking and crying until it kicked in and I fell back asleep And I missed another day of classes I dont want this to be a sad post I dont want this to be a pity post Because I am getting better Im just not there yet So when I cancel on plans or dont answer your text for a week or never and then insist that Im doing fine when I run into you on campus just keep in mind that my recovery is a lot of things but black and white isnt one of them,1,-0.8092,0

So crazy to think that two years ago I was sitting in an Oral surgeons office waiting for news about my biopsy For two years I So crazy to think that two years ago I was sitting in an Oral surgeons office waiting for news about my biopsy For two years I had been told oh nothing is wrong except an infection or you need a tooth pulled when in reality it was so much more Finally i found a dentist who referred me to a great local Ora surgeon I got the scariest news of my life That I had cancer The cancer I had was one no one local had seen in a 21 year old at the time I was told it was something a 60 year old would have gotten Therefore no one would treat me in my area I found a great surgeononcologist who I hated as a person and he and I have butt heads many times He was rated TOP Doctor several times and he was arrogant about it and I was determined to make him less arrogant Although I didnt see it at the time He was quick to schedule me to have the tumor as well as part of my jaw removed to help me into remission Because of him even though it was stage two and radiation was suggested I only needed surgery In less than a month I will be 2 years cancer free thanks to this man It literally took me until 6 months ago to get along with him and be able to be civil He is literally my favorite doctor at this point other than my primary Feeling so many emotions today It hasnt been the easiest of recoveries because of all of my other health issues loose teeth and jaw issues from the cancer and because Ive had several cancer scares along the way but hes been there to do what he could to make sure it hasnt returned even though he was almost certain that it would because he found precancerous cells But I am beyond grateful even if it were to come back because I know I made it this long and I could do it again Especially with the help of my wonderful wow not a word i thought Id ever use to explain this man haha oncologist,0,0.9597,0
Complete Remission I found out 2 weeks ago Im in complete remission from leukemia Because of the chemo I had ATRA and arsenic trioxide I need to wait at least a few months before trying again to get pregnant Im thankful that my fertility wasnt completely lost due to cancer but the wait is agonizing I have my next follow up in June to ensure that the leukemia is still in remission and I think were aiming to try and start ttc after that appointment Theres always a chance it could come back but the odds are in my favor that it wont All my oncologist has really said was that the treatment wouldnt impair my fertility but hes never personally had a patient go on to have children that he knows of The kind of leukemia I had was so rare and the treatment I had is so new There are a few clinical studies Ive dug up of successful pregnancies over the last few years following the type and cancer and treatment I had which gives me some hope My fingers are crossed that the reason we couldnt get pregnant was because I unknowingly had cancer and my body just knew what not to do,1,-0.1307,0
Why I have recently found out that one of the sweetest people I have ever met in my life is sadly losing her long painful fight against cancer Even through her illness she always makes people smile and tries her best to participate in everything like the other kids She is a very strong girl she has always been and has fought through her battle hardHeres a bit of her cancer story Emma was nine years old when she was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer on 1st October after a short illness She had an immediate surgery to release the pressure on her brain caused by the build up of fluids and shortly afterwards had a second surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible The second operation removed of the squash ball sized tumour Immediately after the second surgery Emma started a grueling course of radiation therapy which lasted six weeks With a short break over the Christmas period to recuperate from the radiation therapy Emma then commenced a six cycle chemotherapy regime that was to last seven monthsThe treatments were administered at British Columbia Childrens Hospital in Vancouver During the treatments the Emmas parents stayed for short and long periods at the Ronald McDonald House in Vancouver often away from their son Charlie who was seven when Emma was first diagnosedIn August after further MRI scans Emma and her family were told that Emma was in remission and that there was no evidence of cancer Emma began her road to recovery from the ravages of the radiation and chemotherapy treatments which had taken their toll on her body and mindEmma seemed to be doing well but in August started to have spells of being unwell culminating in suspected meningitis The illnesses did not recede with treatments and as the family became more anxious further test were made On 1st October exactly two years after the first diagnosis Emma and her family were informed of the devastating news that cancer had been found in Emmas spine Emma was officially in relapse and very ill After a short round of radiation therapy Emma was once again placed into a chemotherapy regime I know that I and many others are fearful she will not make it through I am so sad that the amazing Emma hasnt got to have a normal life and grow up without a worry but it seems that some of the most beautiful souls have to leave us behind too early I know she will remain with us in our hearts minds and everything we do we love and will miss you Emma thank you for all the great laughs and smiles if you would like to read more about her story or fund her campaign here is the link,1,-0.1207,0

Story of Sai A TwoTime Cancer Survivor By Marisse Lee Sai Belloan a young lady aged 21 is one of those souls I happened to meet by serendipity in the virtual world of Facebook A twist of fate I would like to call it that way If you check out her FB profile she would strike you as just another normal young woman who likes Game of Thrones and most likely has a crush on Kit Harington lol now who wouldnt anyway dogs Justin Bieber oh go and love yourself Friendsagain who wouldnt and must have once recently fall madly in love with KDramaKorean drama TV series and the Kendoll like Korean actors Pretty much like everyone in her age in this country I bet She is blessed with a lovely face and a lovely family She is the youngest of two siblings borne from a family who earns their living from manufacturing shoes and bags She was therefore living a normal and comfortable life until this huge challenge came along in her life at the age of 15 She was afflicted with Hodgkins Lymphoma The Mayo clinic described it as a cancer of the lymphatic system which is part of your immune system In Hodgkins lymphoma cells in the lymphatic system grow abnormally and may spread beyond the lymphatic system As Hodgkins lymphoma progresses it compromises your bodys ability to fight infection Its symptoms include fever night sweats and weight loss and oftentimes the presence of a nonpainful enlarged lymph nodes in the neck under the arm or in the groin area Feeling tired and itchiness may be felt by those affected with this type In Sais case the symptoms consisted of itchy skin persistent dry cough for 3 months the phlegm was laced with blood in the latter stage fatigue and a lump in her neck that was biopsied via sample taken thru needleaspiration but with negative result However after surgery and another biopsy the lump turned out as positive She went through a treatment consisting of 4 cycles of chemotheraphy Note that HL type of cancer has a high survival rate especially in the case of young patients She recovered and was cancerfree for the next 4 years She graduated valedictorian from high school and went to University of Sto Tomas to study BS Finance She was enjoying a carefree life like any teenagerbut BOOM Just like that cancer reappeared Everyone had one time or another a brush with pain and sorrow We all learn to deal with it let go and then move on However nothing will ever prepare for anyone to have another tryst with the same demon That would be devastating to say the least You already looked this devil in its eyes You weathered the stormand yet it is back Staring you in the face Initially Sai worried that she might undergo stemcelltransplant a treatment that is being touted as highly effective in treating cancer cases I have different unexpert opinion on this matter but it is irrelevant to discuss it here so let us save that for another day but it is quite expensive in the Philippines approximately 50 or more Fortunately financially speaking her doctors put her under the firstlineofdefense treatment which means she had to undergo 6 cycles of chemotheraphy to get rid of the cancer cells A trip to the hospital for each cycle which is equivalent to 2 sessions is a trip to hellaccording to Sai She was in constant pain What with being poked by needles so many times to insert the IVlinewhen a battered vein refused to take in the meds they will simply poke another one to go on with the treatment I will never understand how a 21year old was able to handle all that But she did After each session she would hurt from the side effects of chemotherapy bonemusclebody pains shortness of breath and soreness of veins Alongside with that she had suffered moon face steroids side effect uncontrolled eating and insomnia But thanks to God she is again in remission free from cancer once more Now why the heck am I writing this story Well people cancer is not just like having a flu recovering from it then going back to your routine NOT AT ALL Sai was in college when her HL cancer recurred She was building her dreamslooking forward to finishing school because she remembered how happy and proud her parents were when her older sister graduated from the university She wanted to make them proud of her also A typical dream of a child who dreamed of somehow paying back their folks sacrifices She hoped to get ahead in life as that is what we were raised to do One has to make a place under the sun Cancer provided her a choiceless choice but to quit school She is cured yesstill she lives life with Damocles sword over her head afraid that the cancer may recur a third time She is scared of having dreams for herself again because one day she might wake up losing them once more She worried about her parents because they are getting old and she would not like to see them earning and putting up money for her treatment She posted a long recount of her cancer tale on 22 July putting up a brave face against this oddwhat she did not tell you much about is that she lives everyday like someone near a cliffanxious frightened to fall in that abyss Cancer changes a person It makes you brave because you have no other recourse but to embrace courage It makes you treasure life more because you have tasted what it is to almost lose it It makes you cherish the people in your life because you are not sure how long is your time to share and spend with them Nonetheless at the same time you always live with fearless for yourself but more for the people you love and might leave behind It is a harrowing tale that will continue to unfold every day of her life It will take a very long while for her body to completely recover and regain back its maximum healthit will probably take double that time for Sai to be completely confident that things will be really okay She is thankful for the friendships she gained strangers and otherwise while she has been going through this challenge Misery loves company true It may be misery but from there compassion and love bloom that only show our humanity in the face of adversity Right now she is taking her time to recover She would have wanted to go back to school right away to avoid the additional two years thus additional expenses she may incur as a result of the implementation of K12 Program in the Philippines However I tried to reason out with her that there are more important things other than college educationand that at this time priority should be given to her health it being given back to her for yet another chance I love to mention here that Sai learned watercolor drawing by herself from the YouTube University pun intended while she was sick When I asked her the other day what is she keeping herself busy with she said Painting my bedroom Oh the kid must be doing a Michelangelo on her ceiling who knows She also continue to share stories of her friends that are still battling with cancer and seeking financial assistance in the hope that by sharing their posts she might be able to help find a charitable soul who may be willing to extend help She established a Facebook group for HL and nonHL cancer patients which you can find through this link Lastly Sai never lost her faith that God is there for her and her family My goal in writing her story is not to educate you about cancer Google can provide you with tons of information if you would like to read about itneither am I seeking pity and consolation from you although understanding and compassion is very much welcome If you are reading this I am knocking at the door of love and kindness that reside in your heart please hear my prayers 1 I am begging you to show support to people who are suffering from cancer by sharing their stories especially those who are in need of financial assistancethat is the least we can do By doing such perhaps our efforts might lead to someone who has the means to help It is shooting in the dark yes but who knows an arrow might find its way to the right heart 2 If the cancerpatient is selling items to raise the money required for their treatment we can either patronize hisher product or again help in the selling campaign I do not have to remind you though to check authenticity of any such campaign before diving into itHeaven knows how the Internet works these days 3 If you have the financial means kindly donate to their GoFundMe 4 If none at all sincere prayers will do Humans are beings made of energy Prayers are energy You get the picture Having said that please start with Ramon Christopher Casi Ramos Burgos He is Sais friendanother soul suffering from nonHL cancer that she happened to befriend in the cancer community Originally we intended to write a story for Casi but he has been confined in the hospital and not available to provide details that we need By sharing Sais story you will be sharing Casis battle with cancer as well If you are able please check his GoFundMe at Your financial help whatever the amount will be most appreciated Or if you are interested in ordering cancerawareness tshirts you can check this link to place your order PLEASE I BEG YOUshare Sais story and by that sharing Casis plea or kindly repost Casis GoFundMe link or help him raise the US50 it only has so far a loooooong way to go by promoting the sale of his tshirts A simple click a simple share is all we are asking from you Maybe somehow somewhere it would get result,0,0.9946,0
Remission After my doctors appointment today its official Im in remission All presurgery tests I had done along with the labs they took today all support the fact that I am currently cancer free Generally speaking if there is going to be any reoccurrence the chances are highest that itll happen in the first 2 years After that it drops off dramatically until year 5 which is when they really start to consider throwing the c word around To be clear the c word I speak of is cured We are a long way from that But like most of this I am not even sure what the really means anyway this isnt like I had pneumonia or the chicken pox All said though all positive news In terms of next steps I do have a scan scheduled as a part of my now diligent monitoring regimen in late DecemberEarly January This also happened to be a really good appointment from the conversation I was able to have with Dr Desai So much of the focus is obviously put on the physical removal of the cancer and to eradicate its chance of spreading but now that we are past that piece currently no one lives in a vacuum There are all kinds of outside elements that continue to influence and affect us as human beings Now how do we go about fully assimilating back into normal every day life with those factors involved And thats not to say that I have felt unassimilated More so however with what is it going to take for one to operate in a healthy fashion within the new normal that will be continuing dealingthinking about things that people never having cancer fortunately dont have to experience These new realities arent as he said easy things to flip a switch to Instead to think of this total recovery as a dimmer switch with a gradual turn up of light rather than the simple light switch of OFF then ON My physical recovery is still something that is still very active albeit for the most part internal As he again reminded me we are just 3 months since my last chemo treatment and just a month outside of this last surgery the body biologically takes time to recover Much like training for a marathon slow builds week over week over week is the key Whats funny is that as the doctor telling me this Ive heard this all before from many places in life From personally in family friends to professionally from bosses and all the way back to baseball coachesbasics of the road to success Incremental gains One brick at a time I suppose it is human to lose sight of this now and again What I realized however was that in this rush to get to and feel I ended up losing sight of the gains that truly have been made That this as he again reminded me has only all just been slightly over a year A blip in the radar of life Once the all the physical is restored over the course of the next months the perpetual psychological journey continues Dr Desai also gave me some really good tips today about the continued slow ramp up of exercise diet meditation and certain acupuncture treatments to help in complete holistic health The challenge of finding the right alchemy and balance of it all only fuels my passion while continuing to make small little gains every day,0,0.9964,0

A Shocking Revelation Meagan and I want to have a threesome with NED NED as in No Evidence of Disease There are lots of terms referring to ones status with respect to cancer Cancer free cancer in remission currently under treatment but stable and then of course I have cancer With melanoma there is probably little prospect of ever being declared cancer free Its characteristics capricious prone to sudden outbursts after laying dormant the lack of therapies that convincingly eradicate it or durably eradicate it its immune system connection mean that what one might hope for optimistically is to get rid of all evidence of it through surgery shrinkage and disappearance of tumors through whatever biological therapy you are on Weve got to set ourselves up as having a chronic long term disease but one in which there is no evidence of disease for a long long time And hope that maybe the last therapy really did the job and it truly is gone Then we need to scientific community to continue to move forward and truly find a cure So we want our threesome with Mel to be over We are a nice couple wed have a great threesome with NED,0,0.9699,0

Words From A Cancer Survivor First off Id like to say that that is such a wonderful fucking phrase to be able to say I am a cancer survivor I beat cancer kicked the everliving shit out of it and chased it back to the island of misfits toys That being said the whole experience really tore me up And its going to be a long time before I feel normal whatever that means again The physical part of it was pretty bad Not being able to sleep constantly throwing up and just lots of overall pain Staying in hospitals and surgery and MRIsCTs suck But what really kills you is the mental aspect of it all The constant worrying about well everything School friends your family wanting to eat because youre starving but you physically cant emotional imbalance crying your damn guts out And let me be the first to tell you people will let you down during this process They wont be there for you and that sucks It really does But you start to really appreciate the people who are there for you But for now Im okay Theres a chance it could come back in a few years Theres a good chance And even if it doesnt its possible that my brain was adversely affected by the whole process But for now I am okay There are still sleepless nights and tears and anger and all kinds of emotion that I cant even describe But for now I am okay So please if you need someone to talk to someone to lean on or just someone to listen to you cry on the phone for hours tell me and I will not hesitate I understand,1,-0.8088,0

Last Month I woke up today and I realized something BIG I dont know why it didnt hit me before but it did today in a big jolt It is my last month of chemotherapy Wow time really flies by fast when you are having fun On March 29th I was given the news by my oncologist that I have no more cancerous activity inside of me You would think that when someone tells you that you have no more cancer you would go through this insane dramatic moment where you are probably doing the hakuna matata on top of your bed Instead the only response my doctor got from me was a very catatonic oh alright Dont get me wrong I was and am definitely grateful but for the longest time I had absolutely no idea how to emotionally feel about this news Its hard to forget the past six months of my life Probably 10 of the 14 days I am given in between chemo sessions I am in bed too sick and in pain to get out although my body has gotten stronger with each passing chemo session and 10 has shortened to 7 Probably if I didnt have pictures of me from before cancer I wouldnt have remembered how I looked with hair Probably I have spent so much time hooked up to an IV machine that the scars from the needles will never completely fade away In that instant when I was given my remission news I realized that even if cancer wasnt inside of me anymore Cancer and I will have a lifelong relationship But with each passing day the news sinks in more and more and I can finally feel myself nearing towards the end of cancer Its been really tough but I have gained more perspective of the real world in the past couple of months than I have in my entire life If I could give one advice to anyone touched by cancer its be patient and take it one day at a time And DONT loose faith ever On a seperate note I know I havent written a cancer post for quiet a long time I promised myself I would document this phase of my life and write for myself and for others I did a terrible job at that but I will still be updating this blog with cancer posts just many of them might be in the past tense,1,-0.9846,0
Not a fan of today already Ive been cancer free for almost 8 years now Today the doctor calls me and tells me all my results came back pretty much fine Only thing they noticed is some stuff with my heart Not a big issue at the moment just something to be looked into I dont want anything bad happening Ive been doing so well It scares the shit out of me even though its not a big issue No cancer still which is great but now and until the day I do die I have to worry about what the chemo has possibly done to the rest of my body As if dealing with cancer wasnt bad enough theres always more that can happen And that blows,1,-0.5098,0
On one of the reviews someone left on my story they asked me if I had done my research I wanted to punch the computer AND they asked me like 29 questions but they have PM turned off Oo They have NO idea how much research I have done I know more about biopsies then I ever wanted to Ive seen videos I know what happens after I know what not to do before one I know a shit ton about MRI machines Do you know what the difference between an MRI and a CT scan is No I do I know ALL about it I know how MRIs work I know what the best brand is I know what freaken sounds you hear when inside I know about wigs Fake hair vs real hair I know the general costs ways to take care of it and style it how many times it should be washed a week I know about the general path of lung cancer I know how it starts I know the procedures to try to get rid of it I know how it spreads I know how fast it spreads I know where it usually spreads I know about chemotherapy The side effects how long the side effects last how long the chemo session takes I generalized on the amount of time it would take for her to go into remission I read four articles about remission yesterday because its different for everybody I have it at 6 rounds of chemo which is 12 weeks so about 4 months I know its short but thats what I wanted and I found it fairly reasonableplus for my readers that I know followed me on here its not gone forever soooo So tumblrers do you think Ive done my research,1,-0.9001,0

Update on my personal life new place Years ago I sat down in an office with a doctor who Update on my personal life new place This one is a little darker fam Years ago I sat down in an office with a doctor who wrote on the back of test results I didnt understand with the word CANCER in all caps She proceeded to show me the stages and tell me which one I was in A few days before Halloween in cervical cancer stage 2 I have never felt so tired in my life I have never felt so helpless because it was something I couldnt control I have never felt so lonely because I didnt know anybody who had it this young I was diagnosed before I turned 30 I have never felt so frustrated I was mentally done and everybody was breathing down my neck with questions harping on me on how I should beat it and harping on me for the simpliest of things like staying up late I have never felt so this is my life now everything else is out the door because my main goal was to beat it I had dreams I had things I wanted to accomplish I had places I wanted to visit I had life goals I cried for a solid 3 days before I could even pick myself up take the medicine that I was told was going to make me sick I thought it was a bad dream as cliche as that might sound I didnt want to do it As simple as that I didnt want to do it But I had to And I fucking did it I lost a lot of my hair my skin had hives I was paler than Ive ever been I lost a lot of weight and gained it back quickly it fluctuated out of this world and I just couldnt look at myself in the mirror I bought wigs I relied on eyelash extensions so I could feel normal I cut my hair short so it didnt look like I had a mullet I airbrushed my skin a few times just so I could have pretty arms and legs until I took a shower I lived in hoodies because of how forgiving they are no matter what weight my body wanted to be at that week I watched my money go at a time I discovered chemotherapy was a heartless but logical bitch I couldnt make myself feel beautiful no matter how hard I tried I felt ran over and thought I looked dehydrated and used up I didnt want to do it I wanted it over with But I fucking did it I am STILL recovering from it all Its hard to see pictures of yourself before and see how much a thing like cancer took from you A bastard like cancer People will tell you you are so beautiful but its a process To have long hair again That would be the dream To know for a fact that Ill never have to go through it again That would be the dream To have a place on my own despite the medical bills and the setback it put me at That would be the dream A damn dream A dream I thought that would never happen many times while I took those godawful pills But here we are A new place I can breathe here I can decorate how I want to and look at every single piece thats in my house and smile saying heh remember when you thought the only room youd get at one point was a hospital bed Look Yes the fear of cancer coming back is always in the back of my mind But right now I can breathe here I am proud of myself If anybody is the most supportive and proud of myself its me Ive always got me I can be selfefficient In the words of Lizzo and her song Soulmate Im my own soulmate I know that Im always gonna hold me down And thats been proven time and time again Ive been told by a man that I would never have my own that I was worthless And he beat the shit out of me And I had cancer tell me the same also suffocating me But I have proved those words to be false even if my brain might want to say otherwise sometimes I just want to look them both in the eye one day and say But I fucking did it,1,-0.4299,0

Last Year I thought I was Going to Die Before the age of 21 I can say I never really thought about death If I did it was in an almost hypothetical manner As if the odds of myself or my friends dying anytime soon was about as likely as a global pandemic overcoming our planet and closing our nightclubs for two yearshar har I never really thought about death until it decided to wake me up one morning and stare straight into my face with its huge overcoming darkness Since its first appearance 14 months ago it has taken on various shades of black There have been days where its been so dark I could not see my hands in front of me There have also been days where the sun miraculously appeared and my life stretched out as infinitely as I had once believed it was Now I realise this is what life has always been Life precancer had always been an anxiety ridden race to some unknown finish line I always thought if I graduate from university I will be happy or if I lose a little bit of weight I will be happy or i f I find a boyfriend who doesnt treat me the way his resentful father treats him I will be happy but Ive learned it simply does not work like that I know it does not because I have attained the golden ticket that one is only blessed with when their life flashes in front of their eyes the realisation that life will never be the perfect dream weve dreamt nor will it be a freakish nightmare Life to me is an accumulation of struggles and the make or break of the overall verdict in your experience resides in exactly what you want to focus on A cancer diagnosis will change your life no matter what way you look at it If you are lucky enough to be considered curable you realise that there must be a life after all this suffering After the chemotherapy and the scans and the pain and the worry you must pick up your life where you left off You must move on You cannot become a professional patient But how can you do that when all your world has become is thoughts of the after world How can you do that when you wrote letters to your friends in case of your death to tell them just how much you loved them When you lay all alone in a hospital bed thinking you were about to die and all you could feel was a delicious relief The truth is I dont know yet I know I have experienced hurt but I have also gained this divine euphoria that I had never felt in life before Life has become totally and utterly intoxicating Even as I sit typing this Ive been stopping to look up from my laptop to just breathe Very cliche I know This kind of euphoria cant be passed on or traded Im not even sure if people who havent felt the dark can know truly what this feeling is I hope maybe this is something my fellow cancer patients can relate to I hadnt thought of death until I had to I hadnt contemplated death until it stood in front of me and asked me to describe it I hadnt smelled death until it wafted through my pores my body pumping out toxins as it tried to sweat out my cancer I hadnt thought about death but I also hadnt thought about just how fucking beautiful life was As Eckhart Tolle has put it The secret of life is to die before you die and find that there is no death,0,0.9057,0

Hello Gamers Hello Gamers It has occurred to me five seconds ago that I should probably tell you all an interesting and riveting story that is currently happening to me So here we go Trailer This is health related I will be fine dw lol So on the 30th of March this year a wednesday I woke up to a blind spot in my left eye It was like this little semicircle of despair right about the centre of my vision I figured that it would probably just go away on its own so I didnt worry about it too much and went to class that day Fast forward to Friday and it was still there being an annoying little shit It was at this moment that I was like hey I should get this checked out probably Lucky for me I had a very convenient prescheduled optometry appointment the next day So I go to this appointment and am offered this optional test for 25 Canadian dollars and because that is the only cost for the appointment today subtle brag I go yes please Its that fancy one where they take pictures of the back of your eye How neat That happens and I go into the actual exam bit with the optometrist tell him about my eye and then he sits down to look at my pictures They are funky So he tells me that I have two swollen optic nerves and additional swelling in the adjacent vasculature Theres also this weird other swelling stuff thats going on that he cant explain It turns out that the fuzzy spot was caused by a preretinal hemorrhage so basically there is blood in my eye and that is not poggers He thinks I might have high blood pressure but the additional and weird swelling confuses him so he sends me to the emergency room of a hospital across town to have some tests run So much for the rest of my Saturday So I go to the hospital and get a CT scan and some more eye pictures and meet with some specialists and a bunch of other little tests like a colourblind one for some reason and they send me on my merry way The CT scan didnt show anything so that was pretty neat but they kind of ruled out high blood pressure which meant more tests I would like to note that I paid no money for this brag Sunday April 3rd I go for blood tests at this other place again free They took 12 vials of blood Had to piss in a cup Was wack Monday April 4th I have like a 730am appointment ew so early gross with an eye specialist I repeat some of the tests that happened on saturday and then they sit me down for this dye test where they inject me with a yellow dye so they can see how the blood is flowing in my eyes and then take a whole bunch of pictures The first one failed which was a wee bit painful but on the upside my piss looked like a blended up minion for the next couple days Very surreal After that test I finally got to meet with the specialist in this nice little corner office He was really nice told me that the hemorrhage would probably get reabsorbed so I didnt need to worry about that its gotten a lot better now actually which is nice still a little bit there though He then went through the blood flow pictures and couldnt find anything funky there And then he brought up my blood tests This is where things become a lot less cool Cringe even Basically he tells me that my white blood cell count is incredibly high Like super duper high He tells me that the regular count is supposed to be like 20 and mine is at nearly And this is a symptom that coincides with leukemia Shit Let me tell you that day was not poggers Nothing is confirmed yet though so I go home and proceed to have a very unexpected day I message all my profs and was like hey might die please give me extensions thanks and then I got them I got a call from a hematologist later that day to go over the testing plan going forward It included things that sounded not so fun The next day was my birthday Turned 19 though that was neat Before I go on I would like to mention that the very first thought I had when that eye specialist told me it could be leukemia was Im going to need so many bald jokes Because you know Chemotherapy Wednesday April 6th I go back to the emergency room This time I go to a different place where I get my very own hospital bed in the corner D The game plan is simple In no particular order 1 get an MRI 2 get a bone marrow biopsy 3 get more blood tests and 4 get a blood transfusion What actually happened 1 super quick blood tests less blood this time neat 2 bone marrow biopsy fuck that shit was so weird it wasnt painful because of the freezing stuff but hguieanbcbneuia did not like would not recommend 3 MRI could take a few days to be scheduled and they dont want to keep me overnight 4 ultrasound to look at my spleen and liver 5 no blood transfusion because apparently my hemoglobin count went up since last blood tests so hell yeah 6 I went home What I learned that day 1 i hate bone marrow biopsies they suck donkey balls 2 my spleen was twice the size it should be 25cm instead of 12cm 3 I now need to go for blood tests twice a week I got to sleep the next day Liked that part I dont remember when I got the next phone call from the hematologist shes been fantastic btw I would definitely recommend her very helpful and great with explaining things to stupid little me but it was subpog Basically I was officially diagnosed with CML chronic myeloid leukemia Its pretty rare in people my age and makes up for about 15 of total leukemia patients iirc Its caused by a freak mutation in your chromosomes and has three stages chronic accelerated and blast I got caught in the chronic stage which is the super treatable one and where most people are diagnosed I dont have to go for immediate chemotherapy and if Im lucky I shouldnt need it at all rip bald jokes L Its treated with these fancy little pills and there are like five or six varieties for me to try which is neat I should start those soon Right now I am on two other drugs though The first one is called hydroxyurea and its designed to bring down my white blood cell count I think I peaked at by whatever measurement they had but it was down to like on April 21st so thats some neat little progress right there Ill probably have my dose doubled soon to get that count to come down super fast but for now Im still too white for my own good The second drug is called Allopurinol and its designed to preserve my kidneys because the first drug could make things toxic down there and I would like to keep those body parts thank you very much Everything is going swimmingly so far though so thats good I need to drink like 2 and a half litres of liquid daily though so my toilet is very busy rn I have to take these drugs at 930am every morning which sucks though I just want to sleep in I think thats everything And thats the story of how got a new zodiac sign If you have any questions or good jokes please let me know I will respond to them Please dont pity me though you would not believe how much of that I have gotten in the last couple weeks it is frying my mind I just want to make fun of myself TLDR got cancer fucking L on my part very treatable taking many drugs,0,0.9987,0

Cancer Patients and Oncologists Faced Exceptional Challenges During Pandemic MedicalResearchcom Interview with Katherine Garcia MD NYU Langone Health MedicalResearchcom What is the background for this study Response Studies on cancer patients during the COVID19 pandemic have shown a decrease in new diagnoses delays in care and a shift to later stage disease presentations Considering that NY has been an epicenter for COVID19 in the US we investigated its impact on new cancer diagnoses at the two campuses of NYUs Perlmutter Cancer Center and hypothesized that there would be a decrease in presentations during the peak outbreaks in NY MedicalResearchcom What are the main findings We conducted a single center retrospective analysis of new cancer diagnoses before during and after the peak of the pandemic between Dec 1 and Aug 31 During the initial COVID19 peak there was a substantial decrease in new patient visits with statistically significant differences seen by age and certain cancer types including breast skin and hematologic malignancies In all cancers there was a decrease in the proportion of new patient visits among those over age 75 during the peak When confining analyses to breast skin and hematologic cancers we saw a significant increase in the proportion of younger new patients at the peak period We also observed an association between age and stage with an increase in new stage I diagnoses in the younger age population at peak Telemedicine was most utilized by the younger population during both peak and recovery periods MedicalResearchcom What should readers take away from your report Response In this retrospective analysis we found that during the initial COVID19 peak prior to vaccine availability outpatient visits for hematologic and solid malignancies decreased at our cancer center in NY The decrease in the proportion of all cancer types in elderly patients during the peak was likely related to hesitancy among this vulnerable population to seek care The widespread use of telemedicine also likely contributed to the increased incidence in new patient visits in younger patients MedicalResearchcom What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work Response The effect of the COVID19 pandemic has blanketed the health care system For Medical Oncologists there have been exceptional challenges to overcome Lessons learned from this experience can help guide outreach to vulnerable populations during future outbreaks particularly by fostering telemedicine use among the elderly I have no relevant conflicts of interest Citation ASCO abstract Consequences of the COVID19 pandemic on new cancer visits to a comprehensive cancer center in New York The information on MedicalResearchcom is provided for educational purposes only and is in no way intended to diagnose cure or treat any medical or other condition Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health and ask your doctor any questions you may have regarding a medical condition Some links may be sponsored and no links are warranted or endorsed by MedicalResearchcom or its parent company Eminent Domains Inc In addition to all other limitations and disclaimers in this agreement service provider and its third party providers disclaim any liability or loss in connection with the content provided on this website Read the full article,1,-0.9564,0
Soggy From The Chemo a sickangstfic Soggy From The Chemo a sickangstfic TW for cancer descriptions as well as chemo and addiction I tried my best to depict it as realistically as possible but lemme know if theres anything I need to change in the future I wanted to get a better idea of what Im going to be putting my boy Elijah through in this novel of his and the start of the fic had been sitting there for a while so I decided to finish it I hope you enjoy if you decide to read An overwhelming sense of heaviness sat unabatingly across Elijah as he sat halflaying on the leather seat which made up a part of the ring circling the entirety of the sterily formulaic chemo room It was a feeling he had become accustomed to in the month which had dispersed since his life had ended To the vision of hourglass grains it may appear to have been just another gentle upheavel of a day but to Elijahs unilateral vision another reality was conjured No more was Wednesday merely a day or a headache merely an inconvenience now each Wednesday burnt his veins with sickened throes of dread from diagnosis association and each headache faded blindly into the next and left him in a constant state of turbulent vibration and bone nausea Eating was a chore sleeping was a dream and living had effectively halted He had tried to continue working but all he was able to manage was three days a week on a really good week so that left leagues of time spent of him wasting away in his flat trying desperately to maintain some sense of normality This came in the form of him throwing himself into his painting and drawing anything to keep his brain off of the topic of itself of the cancer which festered within itself He had stage 3 smallcell carcinoma with brain mets The newly formed brain tumour which had incited the need for a diagnosis had only been an extant result of a bigger problem he had never paid attention to while it had slowly developed within him It was one of the biggest cancer killers for veterans and it looked like it had gotten ahold of yet another Who even knew how much dirt shrapnel chemicals bonefragments and active warzone inhalants he had drawn into his lungs during his deployments or how many cigarettes he had smoked through to keep his hands from shaking from the memory of it He always chalked every one of his early symptoms to the smoking it made sense for his chest to hurt and for him to be set off coughing at random right For his lungs to produce acidic rust and for him to have to sometimes fight for breath Surely he was just losing weight due to the stress and the trauma Like the fucking idiot he was he had ignored everything until his condition had advanced to the point it had metastasised elsewhere so that he could no longer ignore it It demanded his undivided attention and boy fucking shit did it have it now A constant physical sense of dread weighed down upon him now never having let up since first hearing Michelle gasp out that word through her tears and certainly remaining steadfast atop him now as the amber chemo syrup slowly dripped into his veins from the IV in the top of his hand knowing deep in his aching bones that he would be completely laid low once he got home that night as if he ever wasnt low these days Perhaps he had thought that each infusion would become easier because he would have a better idea of what to expect each time but that had turned out to be a total sham every single session he was left feeling worse than the last and could expect to be glued to the couch his bed or the bathroom floor for at least the first four days afterwards He had begrudgingly taken up knitting to craft himself some personalised beanies to hide his barely peach fuzzcovered head and his mouth was a constant bleeding mess of sores he still couldnt work out how to combat His complexion had seemed to permanently lighten from the gorgeous deep brown it usually was perpetually washed out in appearance with a face once nicely toned left puffy and swollen Everything he tried to put in his mouth was coppery in taste and never wanted to stay His clothes which were now practically always heavy and winteryintended constantly became heavier and grossly damp from the treatmentinduced sweats and he trembled with a fever he could never seem to break His chest and head constantly hurt to the point of tears and sometimes blacking out and he had a total of six more grandmal seizures since his first His mind seemed to have come to a complete standstill so foggy he could barely speak at times and when he did it sounded as if his voice was totally alien to him as if someone else entirely was steering his ship They hadnt passed their aptitude test however and they steered him into walls and sent him to the ground it seemed every time he tried to walk to the point Michelle who had become his biggest support system and makeshift caretaker had suggested they look into a wheelchair for him This wasnt a big deal for her she already used one spasmodically for her MS when it got particularly burdensome but Elijah was extremely unimpressed with that idea he hadnt even needed one when he had returned home disfigured from war why would he suddenly start using one now That was an ongoing fight between them but aside from that Michelle was entirely in his corner taking him to appointments getting his groceries caring for him where no one else could He knew his family so wanted to be with him in this but by this point they had scattered all the children now independent and many had ended up returning to Italy Two of his siblings Bella and Mattia still remained in the country but they were nowhere near him it would be an insurmountable task trying to get to him and it wasnt something he could expect them to do He didnt have any friends outside of work he could actually trust Michelle really was the only one he had and he couldnt be more grateful for that He nervously sucked on what was so lovingly called a cancer pop a warmtasting turmeric and cinnamon popsicle he was always given every infusion and despite it hitting his stomach awkwardly and making it twist in protest it was like practical heaven on his soreinfested mouth He had managed to down a warm almost sickeningly sweet tea and a few digestives since sitting down as the staff insisted he eat as much as he could during the sessions probably due in part to the fact they knew he found it so hard to do so while at home and while the actual chemo hadnt started making him feel sick just yet you werent exactly given a lot of time to recover between infusions he was still fighting off the last dose Plus every time he didnt spit out the bloody mucous he produced regardless of whether he had been coughing or not it just got swallowed and went straight to his stomach Swallowing a concoction like that would make anyone green around the gills not to even mention he did it multiple times a day As he ate his popsicle he found he stopped breathing while performing the sucking motion and thus when he would eventually stop and swallow what he had worked off the stick he would have to fight to regain some of the oxygen he had missed which with his cancerriddled lungs was an extremely hard undertaking He got out of breath so easily merely sitting still and not moving at all just doing nothing but breathing he would get winded tiring out just by the mere effort of pulling air in and pushing it back out They were currently in the middle of assessing whether he needed supplementary oxygen but apparently he didnt quite meet the threshold just yet Elijah couldnt help but be stuck on the distinction yet How encouraging Youre fine for now But how long would that last He had unknowingly left his cancer simmering within him for quite some time what seemed like a drastic and rapid outcome had in actuality been a long time coming He hadnt just woken up one day with stage 3 cancer it had once been a vague tickle in his chest probably a year ago where he had just chalked it up to smoking a bit too much Well he hadnt technically been wrong Because this wasnt the paediatric oncology unit and he and Michelle werent married or in that kind of relationship it was encouraged that she didnt accompany him to the sessions where he and everyone else there were severely immunocompromised and were already putting themselves at risk just by being there to get their medicine Michelle entering the hospital unnecessarily would up the risk of either carrying or coming down with all the various illnesses they generally tried to keep away from the cancer patients which would in turn put Elijah at great risk of getting sick and with his lungs was a very dangerous situation Thankfully thus far they had been successful in keeping from infecting him but that wasnt due to luck he and Michelle barely took off their face masks and everything in his flat had been disinfected and redisinfected again They were putting their all in keeping him as healthy as they possibly could and that included him being alone through these awful sessions He always left with a little less of himself a part he knew he would be slow at regaining if he ever did manage to Another part Michelle would never get to see again If he got through this and went into remission which was admittedly a farcry when he had only started receiving treatment when it had already metastasised he wouldnt come out of it whole He could almost feel the holes this poison drug burned through his veins right to his skin He returned from war only to walk himself right into another one that only he was a member in There would be no Reggies or battle mates or even Iraqi girls to carry him to safety now He started this new war and he was the only one who was able to fight it Although he guessed he had a new battle mate Too bad she had to wait in the car Hey Eli tried to keep the car warm for when you got out How you doin can I get you anything Her reassuring voice was a blessed anchor he could grab onto as he stumbled in a miserable haze from the sliding doors and fell into the passenger seat of his car He always left these sessions hollowedout nothing behind his tired eyes except exhaustion and utter emptiness As he sat panting damply hand resting on his heaving chest he fought not to be swept beneath the waves he constantly struggled against because Michelle didnt deserve that He was already at the mercy of his brain tumour to lash out still struggling to keep some of the Elijah he loved so dearly around Where would he be to accept all this help from her when she didnt need to be doing anything for him just then to verbally abuse her and curse her out for only trying to help But it was so fucking hard these werent conscious decisions he was making to act out given literally any other alternative he would take it in a heartbeat So unable to look up into the pure expression of concern he just knew would be drawn across her face he swallowed thickly tasting blood and murmured Thanks it was fine I just really want to go home now I want Private Private was his blond fox terrier and without fail he would lay either in his lap or beside him or at his feet every single time he came back from chemo and just that tiny gesture meant the world to him always at least got him a little bit emotional which frankly wasnt hard these days All he wanted right then was his couch and his baby Private just seemed to have that ability to warm him when nothing else could in more ways than just one and he definitely wanted to get in some muchneeded cuddle time before the chemo would catch up with him At least give him a few minutes After a brief shower in which he just stood beneath the water unmoving he immediately changed into his comfy pyjamas and a huge hoodie along with a few dozen blankets and parked himself on the couch and much to his joy Private wandered over to him and jumped up beside him heading for his lap as if on autopilot He laid down beside him with his head and front feet draped across his lap and Elijahs hollow heart swelled oh so subtly working his real and prosthetic fingers over his almost cottony fur smiling for the first time that day as he murmured Hey boy you keeping daddy company Of course why wouldnt he want to Michelle giggled as she walked around the couch to set the bucket which had been appointed specifically to after chemo and nothing else by his feet the plastic liner within it rustling with each movement She also placed down his freshlyfilled Glospee water bottle the ice within rattling most satisfyingly a glass of also iced ginger ale and his webster pack Ill start making dinner when Im finished up here but can I get you anything before I do Your sketch book or your switch Elijah still couldnt handle the look he could hear in her voice so didnt meet her gaze when he requested Probably just the remote today I am he paused to catch his breath and rub at his face so so very tired tonight Michelle smiled sadly down at her very best friend What she wouldnt give to be able to cure him she so deeply ached to see that old smile of his back on his face one which told absolutely no tales of what he had seen in life She hadnt seen it in so long even before he had been diagnosed because the old him had already been in the process of being sapped Why had this beautiful man had to have been the one to be laid low by his own body like this Why hadnt it been her Why were her own symptoms beginning to go into remission when no one was sure if Elijah would ever have that chance If she kept standing there she may just speak that sentiment aloud which wasnt something Elijah necessarily needed to hear not at least when he was meant to be resting She reached down for the remote on the coffee table and handed it off to him her hand lingering on his as she felt her eyes growing warm a painful mass forming in her throat It just wasnt fair It really wasnt fair Elijah had eventually turned the tv on to Netflix and had been getting lost in The Haunting of Hill House while Michelle cooked in the background but gradually he was losing the ability to concentrate on it and all his focus was instead on how cold he was Even with all the layers he currently had on it was doing nothing to gift him any warmth and he was left violently shivering while pulling all the blankets around him as tightly as he could manage Private eventually moving himself to be sitting fully in his lap and stretching his head and front feet up to rest on his stomach up to his chest essentially hugging his person Elijah would be totally remiss not to hug him back and making sure the blankets were still covering every possible inch of him he wrapped his arms around his fuzzy body nuzzling his face against his babys He made sure to try and keep his teeth from chattering while he was so close to Privates mouth he couldnt risk being licked anywhere near it He knew then logically that he shouldnt be allowing him to be so close to him but cuddling with Private was some of the only physical contact he made Michelle refused to risk it where possible so he was totally touchstarved not to mention that his puppy was like a walking heated blanket how could he possibly keep him away when he was sometimes the only form of warmth he was able to experience He begrudgingly ate the chicken noodle soup Michelle had made her goto the first dinner after chemo grimacing at the thick taste of metal cloying the experience and at the warm food touching the sores in his mouth Michelle sat in the armchair across from him silently eating her soup mostly watching her friend struggle with his own She was proud of him for trying to eat he still tried regardless of how much it would soon bite him in the arse It always did like clockwork and yet he gave it a go every time She hoped his tv show would be a distraction to him when it eventually did go south Until then she would watch him and make silent plans to race for the heavyduty gloves as soon as she was needed to intervene At least two hours later Elijah had decided he was too tired to remain sitting up and changed tactics to be curled up in a tight cocoon of blankets his head resting on a pillow which was wedged between him and Privates back Michelle had turned the heating up until she was almost dripping with sweat when he had asked her to but still somehow he was shivering like his life depended on it He kind of wished he had gone into this as a more overweight person because at least when he would start unintentionally losing weight he would have a longer time to go before he was skin and bone He wasnt entirely there yet but he was by this point far thinner than he had ever been and just on that front alone he had next to no heat reserves This utter cold however did nothing whatsoever to combat the sweat which soon became forming It seemed to take absolutely no time after its inception that he was thoroughly drenched Every single article of clothing he had on was at least damp and still more dripped from every inch of his almost hairless body finding no pause between that and the shivering which found a similar amount He absolutely hated this part it was almost as if he had developed a new layer to his skin made entirely of slippery humidity and it always left him totally disgusted No matter of drying off or showering or fucking anything slowed it down and all it did was cool him down more He was so freezing He clutched himself beneath the blankets his hands slipping on his exposed skin and moaned He knew what the next step was And soon it rushed in seemingly freefalling into him Nausea swelled in the pit of his stomach tightening his upper torso and worsening his trembling This nausea burned his essentially traumatised stomach lining the contents within seeming to churn in a circular motion like an overfull blender while he himself was trapped in a washing machine He was becoming dizzy and the familiar taste of metal was blooming across the back of his quivering tongue two more signs he was going to throw up and soon It didnt necessarily scare him but he knew how much it hurt every time and how out of breath it left him It was such an uncomfortable process and one that wasnt relieved with its fruition he would left at the mercy of that process for days to come more often than not over a week He was nauseous and vomiting more often than he wasnt these days he was admittedly used to it by now but that didnt make him any more thrilled about it He tried to swallow it down and ignore it laserfocussing on the current episode he was on but even though he had rewatched this show hundreds of times he couldnt work out what was happening as if this was his first viewing He hadnt really even broken his attention from it but that didnt matter to his foggy knackered brain it was as if he hadnt been paying attention at all and trying to now was just tiring him out more than he already was But anything anything not to focus on the godawful feeling in his belly But it wasnt exactly something he could just will away his reaction to the medicine and to the disease itself wasnt exactly in his control and soon enough he felt so sick that it hurt to breathe and he knew he should start the process of sitting up to grab his bucket it wasnt safe for Michelle to come into direct contact with his bodily fluids so the moment he began feeling the possibility of vomiting it was just safest to either grab his bucket or run to the toilet When Elijah began sitting himself up Michelle knew exactly what he was after could already see the nausea in his face She quickly got to her feet and crossed over to him grabbing up his bucket and plunking it into his lap before sprinting from the room to get her gloves Elijah was gagging almost as soon as he was upright clutching to the rim with both hands in a whiteknuckled grip while his stomach visibly pulled inward H retched desperately panting just before his ab muscles squeezed hard and a flood of his dinner drained from his mouth and nose splattering noisily into the plastic liner Huh you actually kept that down longer than I thought you would Eli congrats Michelle halfheartedly joked as she reentered the room and sat down beside him rubbing his soggy back as he gutturally gagged a gurgling growl preceding another thick dousing of dark orange vomit to burst hard from his mouth leading him to pretty much shove his entire head into the bucket to keep the possibility of a mess to the absolute minimum The explicit sting present in an inordinate number of points in his mouth was made even more obvious when the next time he threw up blood from his oral sores mixed with the acidic sick to colour the already offputting orange into a downright panicky red If it werent for its blatant reason he was sure Michelle would have had him in the emergency department in a heartbeat If he werent mistaken he was sure she would already be thinking about it regardless further evidenced by the subtle tightening in the muscles of her hand he was trying to focus on present on his back Between the ice in his bones the fire in his mouth the tight nausea swirling in his belly the clammy spinning in his head how much it hurt to breathe and how badly his body craved to be unconscious it was all just too much for him None of this was fair why the fuck hadnt he just died in combat instead of coming back disabled at the mercy of his body eventually killing him anyway He had fought so hard to stay alive for what Just so his own body could kill him later and far slower What had it all been for when his own worst enemy was himself What hadnt killed him certainly hadnt made him stronger Why had he done this to himself From deep in his battered chest he sobbed hot tears flooding his eyes just in time to choke up more seemingly pure acid The effort of forcing it up and then feeling it on his wounds was an agony he wouldnt wish on anyone and one he wished he coud be far away from He begged his body to cease please he just wanted to sleep but it took many more mouthfuls of vomit to be expelled for him to get a break finally coming to a stop in a totally breathless state fighting for air and sobbing raggedly He knew he should try and calm himself down so he could better catch his breath but that didnt mean he knew how He was in such an acute state of misery he wished he could be hugged but that wouldnt be safe That was why he couldnt even have an ungloved hand rubbing his back Why couldnt he just be normally sick where sure you didnt necessarily want to pass it on but it wasnt as if your bodily fluids were essentially corrosive in that situation He could be held without discretion with bare hands not instead handled like some sick animal Michelle may as well be wearing a hazmat suit to Elijahs skewed perception and there was something really dehumanizing about that which burned him down to his very soul He knew these precautions she had to take were only for a few days after each infusion but that still didnt mean it didnt somewhat hurt that was when he needed her the most He had been quick to accept Michelles offer to be taken to bed after he finally stopped vomiting for the time being but had had to be halfdragged halfcarried to his bedroom from how absolutely drained of energy he was sagging heavily on her shoulder while she led him slowly down the hall and to his bed which he practically fell into In the time he had been up and walking the temperature had seemed to lower still and by the time he got to his bed he was seeing double from the shivering his teeth surely going to break from chattering so hard He miserably crawled under his blankets and removed his prosthetics while Michelle rushed to grab the rest that were still on the couch laying them down across his trembling form He felt so incredibly awful folding his hands over his still loudly churning belly and groaning He was getting a headache A disgusted shudder ran down his spine curling up on his side and whimpering trying not to start crying all over again God please just let him sleep he was begging now It wasnt fair Michelle brought through the freshly scrubbed and lined bucket and sat it on the floor beside his bed resting his water bottle on the beside table which was cluttered with various pill bottles and boxes There we go sweetheart Ive let Renee know Ill be staying over again so Ill be right here if you need anything at all Just try and get some rest now you so dearly need it she said softly so wanting to run her fingers through his hair curl up beside him and hold him until he fell asleep but not wanting to risk hurting herself If she were also being honest with herself she was stressed for obvious reasons and desperately wanted a cigarette She had continued smoking them back at home so to keep it away from him as best she could but she really desperately wanted one right then broaching more into the realm of needing it But where would she be smoking while looking after her friend with lung cancer This was an internal fight she was steadily losing at however and she was already in the process of figuring out where she would sneak to after he was asleep to get her hit How could she be so weak How could she do this to him and to herself If not the entire reason Elijah had gotten sick it was at least a high contributor so why couldnt she give them up knowing this was an option for her fate to lead her towards Well they were both addicts Addiction kind of has a habit of overpowering every morality you have to see itself fed She truly didnt want to hurt Elijah She was just too weak to not Chelle Yeah Eli Please stop smoking Okay sweetheart Michelle ran this exchange over and over in her mind as she sat huddled in her car lighting a cigarette in her clasped hands before inhaling and blowing out its toxic cloud This had been the last thing he had said before falling asleep and not even five minutes later here she was having actively lied to him and doing exactly what he had asked she stop Tears ran down her cheeks as she sucked on the filled paper holding it in her mouth before letting it billow out as she sobbed on the exhale hiding her burning face in shame What the fuck was she doing How could this stupid little thing have such a hook on her when she was actively being shown what could happen to her down the track She was betraying him truly she was and betraying anyone else in their situation and betraying herself He had asked her to stop and she couldnt She wanted to grind the cigarette under her foot stub it out and be done with it but the thought made her so nauseous that she had to hurriedly take another drag to calm herself down Quitting was not a likely outcome at any point in her future Im so fucking sorry Elijah she moaned in inner turmoil as she tremulously inhaled pure cancer directly into her lungs blowing it out in another even louder sob Shed need another cigarette to calm this crying down,1,-0.9998,0

One out of three are suffering from cancer in USA Know About Cancer 1 in 3 people in the United States have cancer You or someone you know may have cancer Here is some information to help you better understand what cancer is You are made up of trillions of cells that normally grow and divide as needed throughout your life When cells become abnormal or age they usually die Cancer starts when something goes wrong in this process cells keep making new cells and old or abnormal cells dont die when they should You may be locked out This makes it difficult for the body to do its job Cancer is successfully treated in many people In fact more people than ever before are living full lives after cancer treatment Cancer is not just a disease There are many different types of cancer Cancer can occur anywhere in the body and is named after the part of the body where it occurs For example breast cancer that starts in the breast is called breast cancer even if it has spread metastasized to other parts of the body Mainly he has two categories of cancer Blood cancers are cancers of blood cells such as leukemia lymphoma and multiple myeloma Solid tumor The most common solid tumors are breast prostate lung and colon cancer Although these cancers are similar in some ways they may differ in how they grow metastasize and respond to treatment Some cancers grow and spread rapidly Others grow more slowly Some are more likely to spread to other parts of the body Others tend to stay in the first place Some cancers are best treated with surgery Others respond well to drugs such as chemotherapy Often he will have two or more treatments for best results What is a tumor A tumor is a lump or growth Some lumps are cancerous but many are not Lumps that are not cancer are called benign Of the nodules those that are cancerous are called malignant Cancer cells may slough off where the cancer started These cells can travel to other parts of the body and eventually end up in lymph nodes and other body organs causing problems with normal function What causes cancer Cancer cells arise from multiple changes in genes These changes can have many causes Lifestyle habits genes inherited from parents and exposure to environmental carcinogens can all play a role Often there is no clear cause What stage is the cancer Once cancer is found tests will be done to find out how big it is and whether it has spread from where it started This is called the cancer stage A stage lower than such as stage 1 or 2 means the cancer has not spread much A higher number such as level 3 or 4 means more spread Level 4 is the highest level The stage of cancer is very important in choosing the best treatment for the person Ask your doctor about your cancer stage and what it means for you How does cancer spread Cancer can spread from where it started the primary site to other parts of the body Once cancer cells separate from a tumor they can travel to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system Cancer cells that travel through the bloodstream can reach distant organs Cancer cells can travel through the lymph system and eventually reach the lymph nodes In either case most escaped cancer cells die or are killed before they can grow elsewhere But one or two can colonize new areas start growing and form new tumors This spread of cancer to new parts of the body is called metastasis The cells that form metastases are the same types of cells as the primary cancer They are not new types of cancer For example breast cancer cells that have spread to the lung are still breast cancer not lung cancer And colon cancer cells that have metastasized to the liver are still colon cancer In order for cancer cells to spread to new parts of the body they must undergo several changes They must first be able to separate from the original tumor and then adhere to the outer walls of lymphatic or blood vessels It then has to pass through the walls of blood vessels and travel with blood and lymph to new organs and diseases Symptoms such as fever and bleeding can be seen and measured by others Symptoms such as pain and fatigue are felt or noticed by the affected person The signs and symptoms of cancer depend on where the cancer is how big it is and how much it affects nearby organs and tissues If the cancer has spread metastasized it may cause signs and symptoms in different parts of the body How does cancer cause signs and symptoms Cancer may begin to grow or invade nearby organs blood vessels or nerves This pressure causes some of the signs and symptoms of cancer Cancer can also cause symptoms such as fever extreme fatigue and weight loss This is likely because cancer cells have used up much of the bodys energy supply Alternatively cancers can release substances that change the way the body makes energyCancers can also trigger reactions in the immune system in ways that produce these signs and symptoms What are the common signs and symptoms of cancer Most signs and symptoms are not caused by cancer but may be caused by other causes If your signs and symptoms persist or get worse see your doctor to determine the cause If cancer is not the cause doctors can identify the cause and treat it if necessary For example lymph nodes are part of the bodys immune system and help trap harmful substances in the body Normal lymph nodes are small and can be difficult to find However if there is infection inflammation or cancer the lump can grow Those near the surface of the body can be so large that they can be felt with a finger and some can be seen as swellings or lumps under the skinOne reason lymph nodes can swell is when cancer is trapped in them is So if you have an unusual swelling or lump you should see your doctor to find out whats going on The parts are shown below However each of these issues can also be caused by other issues Fatigue or extreme fatigue that does not improve with rest Unexplained weight loss or gain of 10 pounds or more Eating disorders such as hunger difficulty swallowing stomach pain or feeling sick Swelling or lumps anywhere in the body Lumps or lumps in the chest or other parts of the body Pain incurable or yellowing of the skin or eyes jaundice especially new or unexplained that does not go away or gets worse Persistent cough or hoarseness Unexplained unusual bleeding or bruising Persistent changes in bowel habits such as constipation or diarrhea or changes in the appearance of stool Pain during urination Bladder changes Fever or night sweats Headache Visual or hearing problems Mouth changes such as sores bleeding pain or numbness There are many other things not listed here If you notice significant changes in how you are functioning or feeling especially if they persist for a long time or get worse consult your doctor If it is not cancer related your doctor can learn more about it and treat it if necessary In some cases cancer can be detected before symptoms appear The American Cancer Society and other health organizations recommend getting cancerrelated screenings and certain tests even if you dont have symptoms This helps detect certain types of cancer early For more information on early detection see the American Cancer Societys Guidelines for Early Detection of Cancer Also remember that it is important to see your doctor if you have new or worsening signs or symptoms even if you have had cancerrelated screening Signs and symptoms may indicate cancer or another disease that needs treatment Imaging tests can be used in many ways such as looking for cancer to see how far it has spread and to determine if cancer treatment is working Endoscopy Endoscopy is a medical procedure in which a doctor inserts a tubular instrument into the body to look inside bronchoscopy colonoscopy cystoscopy laparoscopy laryngoscopy mediastinoscopy thoracoscopy Can cancer be cured Cure for cancer depends on the type and stage of cancer the type of treatment received and other factors Some cancers are easier to cure than others But every cancer needs to be treated differently There is no cure for cancer Cure and Remission Cure means that the cancer has gone away with treatment no further treatment is needed and the cancer is unlikely to come back Doctors are rarely confident that the cancer will not come back again In most cases it takes time to find out if the cancer is likely to come back However the longer the cancerfree period the more likely the cancer will not come back When treatment appears to be working doctors tend to say that the cancer is in remission rather than cured Remission is the period during which the cancer is responding to treatment or is under control Some people think that remission means that the cancer is cured but that may not be the case In complete remission all signs and symptoms of cancer disappear and no cancer cells are detected by any test In a partial response the cancer shrinks but does not disappear completely Remission may last from weeks to years Depending on the type of cancer treatment may or may not continue during remission A complete remission can last for years and over time the cancer can be considered cured I have What do survival statistics mean When told they have cancer many people ask their doctors about their chances of survival There are many factors in the answer but there are statistics that help A statistic is a number that describes what happens to a large group of people with the same diagnosis Statistics cant be applied to any particular person but they can give you an idea of what to expect The statistics used for cancer are Survival Percentage of people alive at a specified time after diagnosis Overall survival The proportion of people with a given type and stage of cancer who do not die from any cause during the period after diagnosis Cancer or disease specific survival rate Percentage of people with a particular type and stage of cancer who did not die of the cancer within a specified time period after diagnosis 5year relative survival Percentage of people alive 5 years after diagnosis It does not include those who died from other diseases Viability can represent any time period However researchers usually look at relative 5year survival rates What does it mean to be a cancer survivor There are multiple definitions of cancer survivor Some people use the term to refer to someone who has been diagnosed with cancer This is what the American Cancer Society means when they talk about surviving or living as a cancer survivor increase Others call a person a survivor only if they live several years after being diagnosed with cancer However keep in mind that some people take longer to complete treatment and not everyone completes it Some people live with cancer as a chronic disease for years Other affected people such as family members and friends may also be considered cancer survivors Being a cancer survivor means different things to different people Some patients are cancerfree after treatment but may experience late and longterm side effects from treatmentOthers may be cancerfree after treatment but their cancer will return In addition some people need continued cancer treatment to keep the cancer under control But anyone diagnosed with cancer needs care that focuses on their individual needs Not everyone likes to be called a cancer survivor Everyone has the right to define their cancer experience Anyone who calls themselves a cancer survivor should be considered one,1,-1.0,0

The hard part of recovery Is not just recovery but how other people perceive recovery and remission When I say I am in remission I do not mean that I am cured You are not considered cured until there has been no recurrence of ANY cancer ANYWHERE in your body for at least five years Even then seven ten even twenty years down the road cancer can still occur Even the drugs and radiation I was given to treat my cancer can cause leukemia or lymphoma or other cancers I have to live with that fear see doctors and have imaging done for the rest of my life I am in remission not cured not even considered to be cancerfree yet if ever Recovery is another misconception Recovery is not a straight line I was in chemoradiation constantly and without a break for five weeks I was allowed time to recover before starting eight treatments of harsher chemo cocktails called FOLFOX Some side effects of chemo hang on for a year or mor e With me that includes neuropathy chemo brain vision issues jointmusclenerve pain balance and mobility issues some are getting better and some are not Recovery does not mean that I am well it means that I am recovering from treatment and trauma believe me there is a lot of that Im in therapy for that trauma and for survivorship Im recovering thats all Surgery imaging and other procedures are a part of treatment and I have had in the past year Colonoscopy 2x MRI 2x CT scan 4x Cystoscopy 4x Nephrostomy 1x Foley catheter 1x Uretal stent placement and removal 3x Shoulder pin plate and screws 1x Xrays lost count Full hysterectomy ovaries tubes uterus cervix Bladder and uretal resection Colon resection Temporary ileostomy with upcoming reversal and recovery Labs lost count Adverse events reaction to CT scan contrast reaction to cyclosporin Further recovering from surgery is like recovering from being hit by a bus It doesnt take weeks it takes months it takes pain control it takes an understanding of what I can and cant do afterward Hell it took me six weeks to take a shower standing up and that long to be able to put on socks and shoes Little victories include going up a ladder and changing a lightbulb or vacuuming or learning to do squats again Further having an ileostomy is very isolating You have a bag attached to your body to catch your shit Why Because that resection needs to heal Your diet is restricted and lots of things can and do go sideways If you sweat the adhesive seal will dissolve Its hard to stay hydrated It can get blocked painful and potentially dangerous Your skin gets irritated to the point of bleeding and blistering from repeated applications and removal of adhesive You have to buy ostomy bags ostomy rings to make sure the bag sticks periostomy wipes skin prep wipes adhesive remover wipes a special powder for hurting skin and because you feel less like shit some cute ostomy bag covers My ostomy bag shorties are pretty cute too Honestly the first time I looked at my stoma I almost threw up and did cry You cant just pick up the supplies you need at the local CVS and ostomy supply companies want a prescription from your doc for each and every little thing Your insurance may or may not cover the supplies or have a copay I ended up getting mine from Amazon as its cheaper and faster Anyone who tells you that you should only need to change the ostomy bag every three to five days is a liar I move I exercise I sweat and that bag does not stay stuck for more than 36 hours Yes I had someone chirp at me But arent you better now I replied The simple answer is yes in some areas I am The truthful answer would take a lot longer Oh How tired I am of oh So tired I need a nap Going to take one now And Fuck cancer,1,-0.9969,0

Cancer The Journey Cancer The Journey First Steps I cant say anything as brave as battling cancer or fighting cancer I think that the best thing I can say is that I am enduring cancer Pronounced to be in remission the last week of December I understand that I am not cured Instead I have what I have chosen to call Schrodingers Cancer they dont know if its there or not but we are choosing to proceed as if it is until blood tests and imaging indicate otherwise Even after five years when they pronounce one to be cured there is always the chance of recurrence or a new type of cancer altogether There will always be a sword hanging over my head as my chemobuddies taught me I found out about my cancer by reading my discharge papers from a place I will call Asshat Central Hospital They referred me to Asshat specialists who from my calls in the middle of February could not see me until the end of march and in some cases as far out as May I needed to see an oncologist and a urologist urgently Over the next two weeks I was stumbling and fumbling as I tried to get care out of my HMO network two more visits to the ER got me a shot of morphine and a CT scan another list of referals and finally pain meds I woke up on the morning of March 3rd in so much pain that I thought I was going to die I knew if I went back to Asshat Central Dunno Medical Center or Clowncar General that even with my PPO that I would die I got my ass in an Uber and over the hill to CedarsSinai I was upstairs and in a bed in a matter of hours I had painmeds and that first night I remember sleeping so deeply I was safe and getting care Within two days all the care that was weeks or months out started rolling in Colonoscopy Nephrostomy and stent MRI CT ultrasounds xrays Cardiac oncology urologynephrology and all the ologies rolled through my room and them me all over the hospital it hurt was terrifying and in the end the platform needed for care Killing the Cancer Instead of the Patient On March 18th I had a power pump installed in my left arm for drawing blood and administering chemo Five weeks of chemoradiation began shortly after Radiation Monday through Friday with a chemo pump Monday through Saturday a Monday infusion of Emend Kytril and dexamethasone followed by Wednesday and Saturday fluids with Kytril and dexamethasone Here is what I will tell you about this phase and how to survive it This will knock you down so hard that you will not know which way is up Radiotherapy and oncology like to point fingers Fuck the fingerpointing You will be so fatigued that sleeping 12 hours per day will be about all you can do You must stay hydrated and its hard even with two hydration bags going in twice a week I ended up in the hospital with dehydration twice and a whopping kidney infection Enterade is a drink that helps calm everything down after radiation and chemo and helps to limit the GI damage both can cause Get Ultima drink powder make up two gallons and put them in the fridge and prefill four one liter bottles keep them next to you so that you can see them When you wake up down one Kiss your appetite goodbye You still need to eat I found that babyfood stayed down the best Once upon a Farm is a good national brand and so is Yumi Kate Farms makes tasty nutritional shakes that dont give you explosive diarrhea I could not stomach meat or dairy and managed to take only gummy vitamins and gummy preprobiotic supplements Spices hurt my mouth and throat and my stomach kicked them right back out My doctor prescribed Zofran sublingual compazine and Ativan compazine in case the Zofran didnt work Ativan when the nausea and vomiting was driven by anxiety I spent a lot of time carrying around a one gallon ziplock they came in handy Saltines and plain soda water do help Youll have a break after chemoradiation at least two weeks Sleep About Power Ports GET THAT PORT INSIST ON THAT PORT It will save you endless bullshit with collapsing veins later as chemo and radiation both make your veins brittle Insist on anyone drawing blood or giving an infusion use that port Get ready to call bullshit when they say that they cant I had bruises up and down my arms until I told them to get someone to access the fucking port or I would damn well walk to Cedars if I had to Be aware of the increased risk of blood clots Your arm may swell and that needs to be seen and treated right away usually with a threemonth course of Eliquis or other blood thinner You could take aspirin as a preventative with your doctors approval but Im allergic to that and other NSAIDS Turmeric ginger black pepper cinnamon and cayenne all have bloodthinning properties but I could not keep them down Likewise grapefruit juice or supplements can enhance not in a good way blood thinning medications About Nephrostomy Bags They fucking suck A nephrostomy should be reversed six to eight weeks after the surgery and the stent in the ureter not the urethra takes over You cart your piss bag everywhere wake up to make sure its not overflowing Youre at an increased risk for kidney infections Heres my tips for living with the motherfucker Order only namebrand bags from Amazon Youll want to change out the bag once per week Keep the big bag for when youre at home the little bag for when you have to go out Coloplast Bard and Medline are all good to use There are bag covers bag carriers and even clothing to keep your bag concealed catch leaks and stop punctures You might want to tape your connections to prevent accidental decoupling Also insist on a home health nurse to change that dressing the angle is such that you cant do it yourself Friends You will make friends in radiation and infusion waiting rooms Youll share space with them in infusion clinics You may lose them It will hurt At the same time youll be happy and heartbroken Youll share tips and tricks highs and lows and a fellowship that cant be described only experienced,1,-0.9955,0

Text from the WP The Ambiguity of Remission Text from the WP The Ambiguity of Remission There is an art to living in a constant state of health ambiguity something 18 million cancer survivors in the United States well know When awardwinning feminist literary scholar Susan Gubar was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in she assumed it was a death sentence Fifteen years later thanks to experimental drugs shes still in remission Gubars brutally honest book Memoir of a Debulked Woman gave voice to the complexities of living meaningfully despite the specter of mortality I recently interviewed Gubar 78 via email about living with cancer As a 57yearold blood cancer patient myself whose mother and maternal grandfather died at 60 of blood cancer the topic is personal The following was edited for length and clarity The question mark of remission can feel like a sword of Damocles When will the cancer return How long have I got Gubar says Q You write Remission I could tell you would always have an invisible question mark after it Remission brings a heightened sense of contingency of being healthybutonlyforawhile and therefore the anticipation of waiting for the other shoe to drop How do you live with that question mark How do you find joy when wellness is precarious A The question mark of remission can feel like a sword of Damocles When will the cancer return How long have I got And those fearful imponderables spawn others Will there be an available treatment that I can endure Can I bear to go through the lifeindeath of being a patient again But if the remission lengthens the question mark generates an exclamation mark I have survived 15 years after a diagnosis that gave me three to five years I received an experimental drug in a Phase I clinical study that many could not tolerate and it worked for nine of those years For the last two years I have been on a drug holiday because longterm use of the medication can cause leukemia and Im still here When the question mark of remission produces an exclamation mark the exultation has everything to do with astonished gratitude for the bonus of unanticipated time in which I have seen my children marry welcomed grandchildren into the world and fussed over my beloved husband What more can one ask for Theres still a question mark but theres also a thrilling exclamation With the passage of years terror shrinks while thankfulness swells Q Watch and wait is the medical stage when cancer is being observed but not treated Seasoned patients know it as watch and worry How do you live fully despite anxiety A No one wants to be counted among the worried well Yet it is impossible not to fret at aches and pains that might portend a recurrence It is also impossible not to suffer from scanxiety as scans tests or biopsies loom I search for distractions trying out a new recipe watching a movie A good book can provide a voyage away from myself into another realm Unfortunately it fails to transport me on the day one of my daughters who inherited the BRCA mutation goes into the hospital for a scan She is among the previvors survivors of a predisposition to cancer I have resigned myself to the fact that the day of her testing will be given over to fright Q Most people run from conversations about death In what ways has facing death brought you clarity or comfort A Like Buddhists and hospice workers and activists for medical aid in dying care I believe that anticipating and preparing for ones own death paradoxically leavens morbid perseverating especially when it puts us in touch with networks of people also contemplating their proximity to the cusp of existence Which is why I continue to attend twicemonthly meetings of my cancer support group I have had to say goodbye to a succession of friends in the group Our conversations help me find the praise songs eulogies and elegies that many of us will want to accompany our dying With the time remaining to me and neither the well nor the ill know how much time they will get I do not fret about things I have left undone Like Steven Petrow I seek joy But as many philosophers have pointed out joy can be elusive It is often a byproduct of activities related to some other goal baking bread making a quilt writing a book So despite my physical impairments I keep busy Q Many patients find it difficult entering through hospital doors over and over for ongoing treatment and care Your description in Memoir of a Debulked Woman hit home Upon arrival the Shakespearean stage direction Enter fleeing echoed like a refrain in my head What hacks do you use to endure hospital visits A I hate entering the hospital in which I underwent so many ghastly operations infusions radiological interventions CT scans and blood draws I bring toys an iPad with podcasts and games on it knitting socks are especially portable Since all of my cancer history occurred in one place I was lucky to make friends with some of the staff Until recently the pleasure of a gabfest with Alesha Arnold my research nurse offset the horror of the place but Alesha died of lung cancer this year At my next visit I will look for the plaque explaining that a fund has been established to honor her It will sponsor an annual award for nurses who manifest her loving and meticulous caregiving Then I will sit in the waiting room and remember how Alesha protected me from unnerving responses to my liminal situation Patients like me need from our companions what Alesha had the courage not to sugarcoat our precarious conditions I learned from her how to pace myself to the syncopation of fear and hope that accompanies my passage in the perplexing terrain of remission a borderland between wellness and sickness,0,0.9893,0

I have to talk about something because I realize I havent yet its about biology I have to talk about something because I realize I havent yet its about biology Oxyphil cells are super weird little guys that I learned about while looking at histology slides for anatomy this was back when I thought I wanted to do nursing We dont know their function so theyre kind of a mystery They mostly start to appear after reaching puberty and then increase in number as we age Theyre also known as oncocytes onco meaning mass or bulk cytes meaning mature cell but they go by a bunch of more specific names depending on their location Plants dont have them btw but we do and so do other animals They have bigger mitochondria that act like gymrats on steroids and more of them compared to the average cell Apparently they even have more mitochondria than the cells that make up your muscle tissues which is insane since you can imagine how many powerhouses it would take to fuel muscle activity I tried to find a vid to show what they look like and I think this youtuber does a good job at that Sometimes benign as in unlikely or slow spread not cancerous sometimes malignant as in spreads like wildfire cancerous Theyre literally just tumor cells which would make sense since oncology is the study of cancer The reason they have so many overpowered powerhouses still talking about mitochondria is because they require a LOT of energy breakdown Your bodys cells love love love carbs like sugar so much that it prioritizes using them over other nutrients to make stored energy readily available for uses like muscle contractions The inefficient way to break down sugar caused by oxygendeprived conditions is kinnnnd ooooof like an Italian grandma making tomato sauce from tomatoes When Grandmas tomatoes enter into the sauceification machine it has two exits One exit spews tomato sauce and the other is where all the separated seeds and skin go Sometimes Grandma pops the seedy skin bits back into the top of the machine to get a little extra out The oxyphils mitochondria work like Grandmas machine Stored sugar the tomato goes in and some usable energy called ATP tomato sauce comes out while also making this other byproduct the seeds and skin That wastebyproduct pyruvate can be reabsorbed by the mitochondria to make even more energy in oxygendeprived environments producing lactic acid This localized lactic acid literally makes your body more acidic but your body is usually pretty good at flushing it out fyi drinking water helps with this process This is also why they tell people to drink lots of water after getting a swedish massage In the case that it isnt clearing itself out enough for whatever reason like say maybe you consistently produce so fucking much lactic acid because you have a tumor with MANY overpowered af mitochondria Well You might be pretty acidic there Good news is you can raise your bodys pH to be more alkaline via deep breathing this would make your body oxygenrich so that you can break down sugars more efficiently You can also eat more alkaline foods like red cabbage and leafy greens Anyways thats all I know about oxyphils and I wish we knew why they exist It feels so cynical to think they exist just to cause death and I dont really believe that anyways since not everyone gets cancer Are oxyphils how the body adapts to make more energy readily available in oxygendeprived conditions resulting in acidosis Does that acidity break down neighboring cell walls Does that mean they permeate the cell membrane and get that healthy neighboring cell to start dysfunctioning too and the cycle continues Also why arent they present at birth If its true that they come from chief cells then they wouldnt really have a chance to form since chief cells are also not rly present at birth Food for thought I just want to know their function and have been for like two years blaaaahhhhh Also here is a video of how a grandma makes her tomato sauce She doesnt put the seedy skin bits back into the machine but some people do I hope it helps with the analogy,0,0.9987,0

Making your cancer diagnosis public is A Lot Sean Curry I couldnt keep going back to that first moment all over again And I was diagnosed with a relatively straightforward wellunderstood form of cancer at a time in my life when I was in excellent physical shape to fight it Had this happened twenty years ago with the science at the time or twenty years later in an older body the news mightve been different Larger than all that however was the actual crossing of the threshold going from not someone who has cancer to someone who has cancer Everyone I hadnt told yet was someone who had unconsciously sorted me into the group of people who had never had cancer Or perhaps it was more about me before I told someone inside their mind existed a world where I didnt have cancer Telling them would change that world and the version of me that was inside it forever It wasnt that it was hard or emotionally taxing or devastating to tell people It was that every time I told someone another world in which I didnt have cancer ended almost as if I was giving myself cancer all over again I wrote about Kate Middletons cancer announcement my own cancer diagnosis 3 years in remission now and how we maybe should all extend each other a bit more grace I hope youll give it a read Making your cancer diagnosis public is A Lot Sean Curry,1,-0.9716,0

Cancer The big C Cancer The big C I am distrustful of doctors and until recently did not frequent them for routine maintenance I had a lot of negative experiences with them and never had anything severely physically wrong with me Not even my wisdom teeth needed to be removed By chance I got the right doctor By chance she had had the same cancer around my age By chance she asked me if we had ever done an ultrasound of my thyroid while I was getting my annual pap I had 0 symptoms I was stage 1 By chance I got the right surgeon I am not in any pain and havent been since day 1 of recovery in the hospital I might not even need the radiation and if I do its just a pill that specifically goes after thyroid cells So here I am a week after surgery my thyroid removed and my cancer hopefully gone There is no way that if the incredibly specific set of events in my life hadnt happened I would have discovered my cancer before it was symptomatic and potentially metastasized into my lymph nodes that I would have been told my life expectancy wouldnt change because of my prognosis So I am grateful for my struggles and suffering I am grateful for living in abusive households for so long and for having mental disabilities that caused me to work myself to severe burnout every few years For my nearly constant panic attacks since Im grateful that my shitty ex broke up with me a month before surgery after 4 years together because he wasnt willing to put in the time or effort to be there for me I am grateful for my cancer I am grateful not just because these things made me stronger but because they were absolutely necessary for my story to be where it is right now For the first time in my life I feel like Im exactly where Im meant to be Ive worked hard to improve myself and get myself ready for the good things to come Because they will I am confident in it And for me as cliche as it is its starting with being cancerfree I know I got really lucky I know that other people will have much more difficult situations to soldier through but I hope my story might help them through their own struggles I have an audience of 0 I dont expect anyone to see this but I hope someone that needs to does I promise hope is out there No one thinks to tell you that you have to make it though Make your hope even if it comes from something utterly silly I promise it is worth it,0,0.9727,0

fans and loved ones from around the world and the cancer community was hit particularly hard by this profound loss The Beverly Hills actress gave people hope and despite her passing which can be especially devastating for other late stage survivors its important to keep going in her honor and not give up that hope that she instilled After the death of a loved one or someone you looked up to its key to remember that grief may look different for everyone The stages of grief are denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance These labels help us frame and identify what we may be feeling These stages can also occur in any order As far as your own cancer journey dont give up There are more and more options becoming available for patients to manage symptoms of advanced stage disease and

powerful voice in the health space with her Lets Be Clear podcast holding nothing back as she aired out past personal struggles in her career and love live and candidly spoke of her daytoday fight Actress Shannen Doherty became a household name after starring in hit shows like Beverly Hills and Charmed This is what I am currently facing Doherty captioned what would be her last video post The day the world woke up to the tragic news comments came pouring in on Instagram for the late pop culture icon Rest in peace Im donating to metavivor today in your honor one fan commented while actress Selma Blair shared Thank you for showing us how to keep going CEO Alana Stewart who runs the Farrah Fawcett Foundation in honor of her late best friends cancer mission wrote God bless you youre an amazing inspiration How to Cope After Losing a Loved One to Cancer After the death of a loved one or someone you looked up to its key to remember that grief may look different for everyone Everyone is entitled to their feelings and yes the emotions are real even if you consider yourself just a fan The stages of grief are denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance These labels help us frame and identify what we may be feeling These stages can also occur in any order The time it takes to navigate these stages can also vary so giving yourself grace and patience is essential while navigating your feelings It often gets better over time but on certain days it can look like depression and on other days people look perfectly normal and can function Dr Scott Irwin a boardcertified psychiatrist and Director of Supportive Care Services at CedarsSinai Medical Center previously told SurvivorNet Grief Comes in Waves Dr Irwin added that grieving people are coming to terms with the change in their life the future they had imagined is now different SurvivorNet also had a prior conversation with Megan Newcomer who lost a close friend to metastatic cancer in She shared her unique way of coping with grief Newcomers friend was an athlete and soccer player so to help her cope she embarked on a marathon race in his honor and advises others grieving to first acknowledge your feelings Shannen Doherty was a passionate animal rights activist Courtesy of InstagramShannen Doherty Then think about a way that you could honor the person through a mechanism that is meaningful to you she continued So that can be artwork music or developing a financial fundraising project It could be something very simple but I do think having it be intentional is what youre doing to help honor this person In a column for SurvivorNet New Yorkbased clinical psychologist Dr Marianna Strongin expressed that it may be helpful to remind yourself that these feelings are meaningful yet temporary If you approach them with compassion kindness and eventually acceptance you will come away from this period in your life more connected to your resilience and strength Dr Strongin added Understanding Metastatic Breast Cancer Stage 4 or metastatic breast cancer means that the cancer has spread to distant areas of the body Even though there is currently no cure for metastatic breast cancer doctors have many options to treat this advanced stage of breast cancer Hormone therapy chemotherapy and targeted drugs are all options to talk to her doctor about depending on your individual needs Sometimes surgery andor radiation is considered as part of the treatment but mainly it is important to focus on improving your quality of life Dr Erica Mayer a medical oncologist at DanaFarber Cancer Institute says clinical trials have shown that hormone medicines are more effective when paired with targeted therapies At some point chemotherapy will be introduced And according to Dr Mayer its delivered at a dose and schedule thats as welltolerated as possible We are so lucky in breast cancer that we have so many effective and welltolerated treatments Dr Mayer previously told SurvivorNet Im so gratified to see that patients are doing better and living longer today with metastatic breast cancer than they have ever done before Bottom line there are more and more options becoming available for patients to manage symptoms of advanced stage disease and its best to talk about specific treatment plans and what is best for you with your own doctor Treating Metastatic Breast Cancer With metastatic breast cancer the primary goal of treatment is to control its spread SurvivorNet offers information about what those options are from targeted therapies to chemotherapy and when these various treatment options can be used We also provide information on new exciting research that is currently being tested in clinical trials and information about when recently approved drugs like immunotherapies can be used For help finding a clinical trial that may be right for you or a loved one try our easytouse Clinical Trial Finder While there have been many developments in recent years when it comes to

Dealing with disquiet over Kates cancer video Dealing with disquiet over Kates cancer video Readers comment on an article taking a different view of life after treatment from that presented by the Princess of Wales Sun 15 Sep 56 BST Im grateful to Hilary Osborne for helping me understand why the Princess of Waless video left me so disquieted Kates recovery is great news but be wary of a softfocus view of life after chemo 11 September I had stage 2 grade 2 invasive breast cancer last Christmas with talk of chemotherapy after the tumour biopsy until genomic testing gave me a reprieve So I got off lightly and need to look on the bright side as some friends unhelpfully remind me There are some silver linings but all cancer is crap And even without chemotherapy I still feel greyedout My heart aches for Kate and broadly speaking Im a royalist But did her PR team really have to add so much saccharine And now I feel just a bit more rubbish about myself and my failure to fully thrive after my own tough but less tough year Ali Hutchison Dorchester Dorset I completely agree with Hilary Osbornes article and also felt that while being pleased that Kate has completed her treatment the jarring and somewhat smug video was inappropriate and perhaps even a little insulting to those who have experienced this journey in the real world My memories of this journey are of fear and terror of how the mortgage and bills were to be paid how my deeply distressed daughters would cope if I died and how on earth I would pick up the pieces of my life if I were fortunate enough to complete this gruelling treatment The privilege that oozes from this video made it unrelatable for those ordinary mortals like myself who had to navigate the same but very different in so many ways path I am certainly no royalist but I also felt that if such a softfocus cinematic video had been released by Harry and Meghan the media reaction would have been very different indeed Jane Dove Isleworth London There is a childish outspokenness in illness wrote Virginia Woolf in her essay On Being Ill Things are said truths blurted out which the cautious respectability of health conceals Was the short video in which the Princess of Wales wanted to share her illness no more than someone diagnosed with cancer who wanted to tell a wider circle than her family and her close friends Perhaps she felt a need to share her feelings with the rest of the world Many of us have been in similar situations although without the restraints of royal life We want to share with others who are happy to listen about the burden of illness Perhaps later Kate as many others will look back on this video as a mistake Many of us have been there and spoken more than we normally would Let us hope that she will one day look back on this video and ask herself why she felt the need to make it Juliet Clibborn London Hilary Osbornes article resonated with me The year after finishing chemotherapy and radiation was not a good one despite the knowledge that I was cancerfree Also being more or less hairfree for several months while it started growing again was difficult There was that greyness that Hilary mentions and there was feeling angry and invisible and there were despairing tears at work Afterwards it took nearly a year for me to feel which means look normal again Good for Kate that shes better Shes lucky that the treatment she had didnt make her lose her hair But she must know that many others undergoing chemotherapy arent so lucky Since shes chosen not to share the details of the type of cancer she had or the type of drugs she was given to treat it which spared her hair in my opinion she probably shouldnt share the artificial goldenfiltered view of life postcancer in her video either Nadia Lawrence Munich Germany Dealing with disquiet over Kates cancer video Letters,1,-0.9898,0

Come on motherfucker you survived you gotta give yourself a break Come on motherfucker you survived you gotta give yourself a break That lyrics from Everybody Lost Somebody by Bleachers has been stuck in my head for a while now Almost got it made into a wooden plague before I remembered my finances On February 9 I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin lymphoma after suffering with symptoms and misdiagnoses for over a year prior And on November 4 I was declared to be in remission The entire process was hell Every two weeks I would go in for an infusion of nivoAVD for two and a half hours followed by five days of dealing with poison The body pain the nausea the weight gain the fatigue the cognitive decline I hated it all For a while I was mentally okay as I just had to focus on getting through chemo week But the monster of selfdoubt and selfloathing mixed with the stress of the ordeal Was I even really suffering I only had Hodgkin lymphoma one of the most treatable cancers where I live And I was on immunotherapy plus chemotherapy a less severe alternative to straight chemo And I lived an unhealthy life So maybe I deserved it Maybe I deserved cancer Evil fucking thoughts in an evil fucking time Shit that I am ashamed to admit Shit that I am scared to share with people But they were mine and it made an already soulscathing year even more relentless So here I am in survivorhood People have told me that survivorship is not the end of it all and now I fully understand what they mean The fear of relapse how every symptom could be a sign of recurrence The grief of losing almost a year of my life to cancer not to mention the other health issues treatment has brought about The burden of those around me knowing what I am now the feeling that they feel I am no longer capable of much The knowledge that they are right I am fatter and dumber than ever and I have so much shame and selfhatred around all of it And why I quoted that song in the title the feeling that I should and need to just move on and be normal I am still unemployed I am still poor I am still in massive debt I am still professionally pathetic Nothing stopped when I got my diagnosis and treatment I initially took my remission as the permission to live normally but I cant get back to that normal I am not the same person I was a year ago I have trauma I have fear I have limits Im slower in every sense less capable and now less forgivable I dont know what it would mean to process things or get better I have spent too long looking up ways to get my brain back only to not remember or stick to any of it I incorporate workouts and diets only to struggle with losing the massive weight I gained in just one year But I need to be normal or at least act it I need to be capable I need to get a job I need to get smarter I need to be reliable again I need to be respectable again And I needed to accomplish all of this yesterday Something in me wants to listen to my therapist making the same push that lyric is I have been through a lot I need to recover I need to process But I dont have the time or as it feels at this point the capacity And the shame of my diagnosis still lingers in here too feeling like I do not deserve any rest I did not really suffer I am just lazy and incompetent Motherfucker it was stage 3 cancer Is that not enough Apparently not to me,1,-0.9987,0

Hi Just a little introduction my name is E and im 20 years old from the North East of England Lets start from the Hi Just a little introduction my name is E and im 20 years old from the North East of England Lets start from the beginning I have always lived in a little town a place where people never really leave theres not much here and pretty much all of us dream of getting out I went to primary and secondary school as normal leaving school thinking I wanted to be a hairdresser then a childrens nurse im sure one time i said i wanted to be a therapist My point is at the age of 16 when you leave school you have no clue what you want to do with your life so many things can happen and influence your life So from leaving school i decided to start Level 3 Health and Social Care and to be honest it was going great i was really enjoying it One day i started getting pains in my arm and shoulder thinking it was from the gym as i had been going often The doctor told me to stop going to the gym for a while and rest The pain never went away it only got worse I carried on with my college work and social life going out with my friends with this pain still bothering me After constant trips to the doctors and hospital painkillers a few scans xrays and a biopsy i was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma A type of bone cancer that id never heard of I had to get multiple rounds of chemo operations deal with hair loss a shoulder replacement permanent loss of movement in my right arm and so much more Having to deal with all of this at 1617 i did not have a clue where my head was at I went into remission in October that year and i have never felt so lost in my life All of my friends had just got on with their life and were much further ahead than me it was like i had paused life for 10 months and just came back to reality I had a few part time jobs like hospitality care work beauty you name it Fast forward to 4 months ago when i completed my Level 3 Beauty Therapy qualification I had finished it but that still wasnt what i wanted to do in life so i had a break from education My current job is working in a jewellery shop which i absolutely love However its not what i want to do for the rest of my life I want a career not just a job I decided to start a Humanities course in September as it had a lot of different paths to follow i started to think about y interests and things i love to give me an idea of my dream job I love music and concerts pop culture celebrity drama movies knowing whats happening in the world I finally decided that journalism is what i want to do So now im here I feel like starting this blog would be the best way to get a bit of experience and confidence in writing That was more than a little introduction but if you want to know more or come along for the journey with me feel free to follow me or send me a message,0,0.9948,0
Oh shit I havent done a cancer update in a bit Oh shit I havent done a cancer update in a bit So I have that temporary illeostomy to keep my colon intact until they go in and resect it and its a pain I should be able to go several days with a bag but right now Im going through several bags in a day Ive got WOC wound and ostomy clinic nurses on the case though so hopefully well get a handle on that soon I saw my medical oncologist and hes got me in for a CT scan tomorrow Thats because I start chemo next week and they want a baseline snapshot so they can watch the tumor shrink Next Thursday I start 6 cycles of FOLFOX which is a lot less than Id expected but the chemo is to shrink things and clean up the margins of the primary tumour and mets so theyre more easily removed by the surgeon and my primary tumour is already pretty localized As the oncologist said its the surgery that cures the cancer not the chemo Im guessing they think that if the chemo goes well Ill get to where they need me to be in 3 months rather than 6 or more Anyhow Im unreasonably excited for the poisoning to begin Time to put the run to the cancer,1,-0.3704,0

SoI had breast cancer And it was terrible And whatever is left isalso terrible SoI had breast cancer And it was terrible And whatever is left isalso terrible I did everything I was supposed to I went to the doctor and got my scans They found a suspicious spot but after an ultrasound I was cleared and worryfree Eight months later I was diagnosed with Stage 3A Invasive Ductal Carcinoma I was so angry but mostly terrified Everything about early diagnosis is awful All of the scans and tests are incredibly painful which I really didnt expect The biopsy consisted of me holding a young nurses hand and her crying with me while the doctor basically stabbed a nail through my breast to collect tumor tissue It hurt so badly Then when I had my first MRI I was lying face down but on a ramp with my breasts hanging down Unnatural and also of course incredibly painful I was just started to call out and ask them to please stop when Justin Biebers Stay came on the headphones and I didnt feel all alone anymore I knew that I immediately wanted my breasts gone Both of them gone Immediately It didnt matter that my right breast hadnt betrayed me my killer left boob had made the decision for both of them Two weeks after diagnosis I had my double mastectomy I was so pitiful after that that I even made the nurses cry I had a male nurse come in and check on me the next day and he told me hed gone home crying I must have been awful Thankfully I dont remember it I think most of it was because they wouldnt let my then four year old in to see me I did get to see my two older boys though thank goodness My friends dyed my hair a beautiful pink I had never dyed my hair before and I was so happy with the outcome I could have kept that beautiful color forever I went straight into chemo The Red Devil was every two weeks and at one point I remember sitting in my kitchen wondering if I was dying I think I probably was I was also bald now No nose hair no eyebrows or eyelashes nothing I looked like a turtle But I was too sick to really care I didnt even mind the Neulasta shot every two weeks I moved on into Taxol and it was actually just as bad for me During this time I was put into the ICU with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs MANY and was on oxygen for months The night before I was hospitalized I told my middle son I felt like I was being stabbed in the back but hey It was just massive blood clots sigh After chemo I found out that I now have Lymphedema If you know what Lymphedema is you know how terrible this is If you dont let me just tell you its so terrible When I had my double mastectomy they also removed 39 of my lymph nodes under my left arm and six of them were cancerous And now the fluid doesnt drain from my arm and gets stuck in my arm and chest and neck and I am miserable I did treatement and have a pump and wear sleeves and all that but it is still miserable At the end of chemo and beginning of radiation I bought a house I want you to know I remember none of it But I love it I wasnt expecting radiation to be bad but of course it was awful Nothing about cancer is fun The burns burned The skin broke The pain pained My stomach did NOT stomach It was truly terrible After that I had a year of injections And a total hysterectomy And pills And bone pain depression anxiety nightmares hot flashes and finally heart surgery It was a hell of a couple of years And if theyd diagnosed it when I got my first mammogram I dont think half of it would have happened Whats happening now though is that cancer never really left me Its always on my mind and in my thoughts With every pain and ache Im convinced its back to get me I hope that this anxiety and fear eventually leave me Please get your scans and check ups when theyre due Take every step you need to take You want to stick around even when things look bleak Theres always a better day coming,1,-0.9988,0

Hello Its been really hard for me to maintain this blog but I would like to write about my experiences posttreatment so expect to see a few more blog entries Ive been thinking a lot about cancer and endings over the past few weeks One of my neighbours died at the beginning of March his organs started failing and he passed away as a result He was really kind to me during my treatment and kept encouraging me to keep going despite the horrible side effects of chemotherapy He told me that wed get through it together and he planned on living until at least 90 Another one of my neighbours has just been diagnosed with breast cancer and I keep finding myself passing on all the maxims he taught me over to her He was a lovely person and he will be sorely missed It makes me stop and appreciate the fact that Im alive Ive survived Im doing really well Im so grateful to be in the position I am now Not just the fact that I survived chemotherapy cancer but that Im better mentally I reread all my posts and I could see how I became more and more depressed and hollow by my posts and lack of posts Ive just finished a 12 week course of cancer counselling therapy and its helped me so much My counsellor taught me that its okay to have feelings and its okay to be tolerant of myself Ill talk about it in more detail at a later stage because some of the tips and tricks he taught me are really useful regardless of whether youve had cancer On Thursday I have my first checkup since my last chemotherapy To say Im scared and worried is to put it mildly I keep having crazy nightmares where my neck is covered in lumps Ive found it really useful to read this booklet about the process when you go for a followup appointment In fact the website has some pretty good booklets on lymphoma in general definitely worth a look whatever stage youre at So allegedly lymphoma has a higher chance of coming back within the first 2 years of remission thats going to be a very stressful two years The booklet also said that most people know that they have cancer because the signs start to come back Im probably going to regret saying this but I think Im okay I have scar tissue from my main lump but it hasnt changed size in the past three months except for a few days when that side of my neck was a little swollen Ive also recently been pretty tired over the past few weeks but I think thats a combination of getting up super early to do extra shifts at work and being stressed out about my upcoming appointments Nothing will stop me worrying about it if people didnt worry about appointments then that would be a cause for concern dont you think but Im going not going to let it overwhelm me Ill let you know more after Ive had my appointment,1,-0.6915,0
June 16 Ive been stuck for a few months now not just about what to write but about what to do In May I found out my 6 month check up scan was still clear of any signs of lymphoma Last time I was in remission my 6 month scan was when I found out the cancer was back so this meant going into uncharted territory Glorious cancer free uncharted territory But I still wasnt off the hook The scan results also showed pneumonia in one of my lungs landing me in the hospital for four days a not so gentle reminder that cancer or not my immune system still isnt what it used to be During those days I finally accepted where I am now where Ive been since February or so Remission Puberty Stay with me now I know that sounds strange but it makes sense to me Its the awkward stage between being sick and well and like the awkward phase you go through in middle school its confusing and frustrating and it sucks Its having enough energy to go to classes but not having enough to keep up with the homework Its feeling well enough to go to a party one night and then spending the entire next weekend watching Netflix because your potassium levels are running low for some reason Its Im sure youll be fine but its probably safer not to do it when you ask your doctor about almost anything Its almost impossible to successfully navigate and confuses everyone around you just as much as it does you Basically it sucks And its still where Im stuck but Ive decided its time to get out My doctor advised that if possible I not take a job or internship this summer and instead work on my health and getting myself to what Im now calling Remission Adulthood Im lucky enough to be in a position where I could take his advice so thats what Im doing And its hard Its hard to know if its good that Im spending all day watching Bobs Burgers because my body needs the rest or if I should be pushing myself to get out of bed every single day Its hard to know if pushing my lungs to get me through an 8 mile hike is a good way to build their stamina or if its just completely dangerous I have to ask myself these kind of questions every day because the answer is usually never the same But Im getting better at figuring out the right one I guess what Im trying to say is that Im still in Remission Puberty but Im ready to get out Its time for Adolescence at the very least So Im back and I should be posting more often now because a big part of getting to where I want to be is getting back to writing and not just about cancer anymore TlDr Im bad at being a kind of sick person but Im getting better,1,0.1216,0

Anxious Ugh I woke up around 3am and havent been able to get back to sleep I have to get up for work in two hours I hate insomnia Its because Im off my painkillers finally I was on them for eight months while battling leukemia and even with a three week taper I still had withdrawal symptoms The worst of it is mostly over stomach cramps aches restless legs but Im still sneezing and yawning ALL THE TIME and I feel like Ill never sleep soundly again Im anxious about everything My blood pressure is literally higher so theres that To make matters worse a close family member AND friend have developed a bit of a heroin habit over the last few months I not only have no real support system and nobody to talk to about my own difficulty getting off painkillers but I have to deal with this Its SO DIFFICULT to feel SO MISERABLE with that shit not only being at my fingertips but being offered to me Its almost comical I havent ever taken any nor do I want to The only thing keeping me away from it is that I have a feeling I would not be a functioning heroin user I strongly suspect that I would pretty quickly wind up dead or in rehab I just know myself and how easily I develop a dependency on opiates Heroin is a line that I just should never cross Its scary that it has become such an easy thing to get Like these people I know that are using I would never describe as addicts or anything I guess they are now but youd never know it At the moment they are functioning and in denial that there is even a problem I doubt that will last forever though On top of all that drama I cant stop worrying about my first follow up with my oncologist in June Now that Im off the painkillers the cancer saga finally feels over to me Its sinking in and I hardly know what to do with myself I also am anxious about finally being able to TTC after that appointment assuming Im still in remission Im kind of dreading the fact that it feels like were starting from square one The nine months TTC before I was diagnosed with leukemia were just so damn depressing I simultaneously cant wait I want to believe so badly that this will be our year Ive been distracting myself by reading lots of Malec fanfic I have no idea why I became obsessed with this I didnt even finish the books and only started watching Shadowhunters with a mild interest I dont even usually gravitate towards slashy fanfic They are just so ridiculously adorable though,1,-0.9973,0

My Battle With Hodgkins Lymphoma Exactly a year ago today July 22 we found out that my cancer relapsed I didnt know how to react soon as I saw the CT scan results All I know is my mom and my sister were crying while my father was holding his emotions back but the sadness was written all over his face I went to my room because I didnt want to breakdown in front of them I couldnt accept it I was in denial for days I dont remember how many days it took for it to finally sink in There were days when Id wake up and think that it was just a nightmare that I could still continue living my normal life But I would always always wake up to the reality that it wasnt just a bad dream That my cancers really back One of the reasons why Im writing this post is because I learned that some people are feeling awkward towards me Maybe because they dont know the right words to say to me Some people are curious and have a lot of questions about me having cancer but couldnt find the courage to ask me Please know that this is still me I had cancer but cancer never had me You can always talk to me or ask me anything I wont be bothered or be offended by it But for now Im going to share my battle with cancer to you Ill just summarize it because its a very long story and I might start crying here if I go through the details My battle with cancer Hodgkins Lymphoma a cancer that starts in white blood cells to be specific started when I was 15 It all began with a lump on my neck It was fine needle aspirated biopsied but turned out negative Then it was surgically removed Biopsied again Then positive I have cancer I then underwent treatment I was in remission for 4 years Then as we all know cancers a traitor it came back At a very young age Ive been through a lot already Bone Marrow Biopsy was the worst experience ever I can still vividly remember the excruciating pain I felt that time I undergone neck surgery as mentioned above to remove the mass on my neck And bronchoscopy to biopsy again the lymph nodes in my chest when my cancer recurred I started getting used to the pain of inserting an IV line in my veins every now and then One try is tolerable but you know what chemo does to your veins So there were times when theyd poke me more than once 5x max And of course chemotherapy I had 4 cycles of chemo before 6 cycles of chemo recently Imagine going through those hellish sessions Not to mention 1 cycle is equivalent to 2 sessions It was sooo tough To me the side effects of chemo were bone pain muscle pain body pain shortness of breath fatigue and sore veins I was given afterchemo meds like steroids which made my face so swollen and made me eat like a monster thats why I gained so much weight That evil drug caused me insomnia too Of all the bad side effects of chemo other drugs the good thing is that I didnt lose my hair it just thinned out a bit But I experienced being bald too like other cancer patients The first time I had HL I shaved my head before going through chemo so I know the feeling I know how painful it is to lose your hair After 6 months of chemo I am again in remission now But the battle never ends here It would take time for everything to fall into place my body to return to its familiar shape my immune system to function well again my hair to grow after cutting it pixie style my battle scars to fade What they dont tell you after cancer is that there are new struggles in the aftermath There are times when I would look in the mirror and not like what I see Post chemo side effects are not just physical but psychological as well We as cancer survivors have a neverending battle with the demons in our heads We are emotionally wrecked After going through cancer people might think that we are back to normal but we can never go back to our normal selves after such a lifealtering fight for survival The anxiety depression and the fear haunt us every now and then The scanxiety every PETCT scan is horrible This is so hard for us especially the cancer patients and survivors of my age because we are still young and we are just about to experience life and reach our dreams But then again our new normal is much more rewarding because we surely did learn a lot We learned how precious and fleeting life is and that it is supposed to be treasured and enjoyed That life is indeed short That we are stronger than we know That God can move mountains That our families will do anything and everything for us That health is more important than any material things in life It made us appreciate the little things and be more grateful for every day We also learned who our real friends are Through this battle Ive met a lot of brave cancer warriors Im very thankful that I found a support group for cancer patients and survivors around my age and made a lot of friends Its a blessing to have this kind of people around me who I can talk to because they are the ones who would understand me the most knowing that they know exactly what Ive been through I couldnt mention each and everyone of you but cowarriors you are all an inspiration to me You guys are amazing To anyone who knows someone battling cancer and in need of moral support feel free to message me so I can introduce himher to our small support group Now Im proud to say that I A TWOTIME CANCER SURVIVOR I am not my body Im not weak fragile or delicate or any other phrase that somehow describes the state of my whole physical self I am not my cancer nor will I ever be So far I have endured everything life throws at me It hasnt been easy It was so devastating but Im still here TYPING BREATHING LIVING I will live my life to the fullest and I will not let cancer dictate me on how I should live my life I will be vigilant but I will enjoy life Im surrendering everything to God My pains my anxieties my worries and most importantly my life Ill never lose faith that He would always restore me I dont know if Ill relapse again Its scary but I dont want to worry anymore Life is too short to be stressing over the things I cant control God has given me so much reasons to have faith in Him even when I dont understand Him And I will be faithful in Him even more when things are

UD A week ago this past Saturday on September 30th my Uncle Dan my dads brother died from liver cancer He was 63 This news came in just a few short days before receiving the news I was in full remission Certainly an Ebb to the current Flow While the end was not surprising how quickly it came after official diagnosis in late summer was just another reminder how serious this cancer shit is Unfortunately although he had many symptoms over the last few years he simply did not get any answers that gave him any chance of beating it until it was far too late We are and always have been the primary champions of our own health If something feels off and continues to we all need to keep pressing and digging until we have an answer There is always an answer Many times unfortunately that answer is cancer but with early detection you give yourself a fighting shot Your body gives you signs Listen to it Ok Enough about that My Uncle Danny what I called him when I was really young Uncle Dan thru the high school years and UD a nickname that stuck during the beer fueled young adult years through the end was quite a remarkable guy A forever bachelor farmer without any significant other or kids simply loved the outdoors As an avid hunter and fisherman he reaped what he sowed Always enjoying the deer or other wild game he bagged including the sunfish he tricked into taking his bait in one of his hot fishing holes Living off the lake and land in his humble abode on Rock Lake just outside McGregor Minnesota He was one of the first guys I ever knew that started brewing his own beer We are talking late 80s early 90s He had no idea how much of a killing he could have made up here in the Pacific Northwest with his perpetual hoppiest possible brew with the IBUs and an Alcohol By Volume ABV level if they were to be measured maximized to match Pair that with all of his unforgettable catchphrases that when he said them were uniquely UD from You Betcha For Sure Think About It F It Smoke It and many many more the man was a human branding machine He was a man of extremes Either all the way in or all the way out There was no middle ground with UD He did what he wanted and if you didnt like it too bad This translated both into some of most delicious smoked fish and homemade maple syrup Ive ever eaten to the some of the most awestruckingly myopic and ignorant politicalsocial belief conversations I have ever been a part of That was UD Meticulously freezing frame as a freelance photographer on the wing of a hummingbird sipping a sugary solution just outside his window to just not showing up somewhere because he couldnt find it so simple and complex all at the same time I will forever cherish the times we shared together from it being the first time I ever played Super Mario Bros he was an early original Nintendo adopter a major bachelor benefit in listening to his sing along baritone over his favorite Merle Haggard song getting a metaphorical nose bleed from one of his room clearing farts that were derived from a diet of venison venny and home brews or just listening to him while we were both sheets to the wind laughing until my stomach hurt tell stories from his past exploits fishing hunting motorcycles girls etc with a confidence and swagger so off the charts that it would make Kanye West blush What a guy with a style all his own He will be really missed Certainly gone too soon Love you UD Rest in peace Photo from December,0,0.9877,0
description of radiation process interesting news regarding chemo My first two days of radiation have been good Im allowed to plug in my own music while the proton beam machine does its thing so if anyone wants to make me a playlist please do My Spotify username is maggsburgs just share it with me there The radiation process is actually super cool What happens is I lay on what they call the couch which is really just an oblong metal thing that has my specific headrest attached to the end Then they snap my mask onto the headrest pictures coming asap I promise haha and thennnnnn they turn on the music I choose and tell me which place in line I am for the beam Im pretty sure the beam rotates between four different treatment rooms so I am either first second third or fourth in line If Im first in line I dont have to wait if Im second I wait like 3 minutes and so on Once the beam is available for my treatment they radio into the room Im in and say We have the beam well begin shortly Then I hear some weird kind of clicking noises and I know that I am having radiation shot into my head Its very strange sometimes I see flashes of light and sometimes I taste chlorine Both are just weird things my brain does because its being interrupted in a way if that makes sense Then they rotate either me the couch can move both laterally and vertically or the beam machine the beam machine is on a huge garage door looking track and can rotate around me basically or both and the process repeats I am beamed 3x per radiation session Its pretty cool Google proton beam machines because theyre seriously super interesting Ill add a picture of one of the rooms that the Mayo treats me in below as far as I know the treatment rooms are identical Chemo news I previously thought that my treatment plan was as follows mf radiation and chemo for 6 weeks a month break and then six months of straight chemotherapy Yesterday I learned that the plan is a little different than what I had thought It will be mf radiation and daily chemo including weekends for 6 weeks Then I get a month break Then the next six months I do chemo five days a month only which is such a huge relief It means I could have a semblance of my old normal life back Im not sure what Ill do in this regard I need to talk to my parents about a new plan now that Im only going to be sick for a week every month rather than every day for the entire six months The chemo Im taking right now is half strength and after my month break they will increase my dose with each round Thats why Im having such an easy time with my chemo right now The doctors say that most patients do well the first couple weeks and then treatment starts to catch up with them toward the end of the 6 Well see what I can do I will note that Ive been extremely tired People continue to treat me differently than I am used to I almost feel like the group that treats me normally is shrinking Its a bit of a let down but I do think its really cool to find that I can empower myself in such situations Ive had like 4 different guys say they dont want a wife or kids in their lives Its strange because no one has ever said this to me in such an unprovoked way and its happened so many times additionally its not like Im bringing up marriage or anything haha I find it a little rude but It doesnt really bother me because A I understand why a person wouldnt want to build a future with someone who was diagnosed with something so intense at such a young age and B its honestly a good weeding out process Youd be surprised having cancer has absolutely crushed my dating life but in a way its also made me so much more prepared to move forward in a realistic pragmatic way Which I will admit isnt the most romantic but hey whats a girl to do I think Ive decided that when I am done with cancer treatment I want to do a PhD program in philosophy Im thinking ethical theory right now Who knows Also New York New Jersey was exactly the break I needed I love my Allie and Allison Thanks for keeping me sane As always I love you,0,0.9923,0

somewhat interesting Because of the chemo Im taking I have to form a bunch of goofy little habits to keep others from being exposed to the chemo Its really good for me but really bad for everyone who doesnt have my specific diagnosis 1 When I use the bathroom when Im done I have to put the lid down and flush twice to try to get all of the chemicals out of the toilet lol 2 If I have sex a condom is necessary Normal for me anyway 3 Only I am allowed to touch my chemo medication If I touch one of my pills directly with my hands thats fine but I have to wash them immediately after If someone else for some reason has to handle my chemo pills they need to wear gloves and should probably be washing their hands after 4 If I sweat a lot in clothes or in bed one night I have to wash the clothing sheets separately from other peoples items Overall a little more safe for me to just wash my stuff separately The list goes on this stuff is so weird lol What a strange little universe I have entered,0,0.7421,0

not much to update on Im still doing pretty well Still taking lots of naps and such No other side effects that are altering my life in any significant way Still doing radiation mf Expecting my hair to fall out where theyre beaming me next week or the week after so when that starts happening im just going to buzz it and do the wig thing Kind of excited about that Also slightly bummed and nervous obviously bc its so new to me lol I had a care appointment with someone from my chemo team and she said that shes never seen hair loss for the chemo Im on so Im happy that hair loss will only be an issue for a little bit She also told me that 90 of side effects that people typically feel during radiation chemo time is mostly from the radiation so I feel like thats a really good indication that I will be fine when I do my six cycles of chemo post radiation Ready to get this shit over with I feel like Im cruising through this its weird I expected to feel so much shittier knock on wood Ill take what I can get I love you,0,0.9561,0

Week 3 of Radiation hair loss weed fatigue ear stuff Update on symptoms Frankly Im tired all the time Marijuana helps me in this respect it gives me energy Like more than coffee does Its the weirdest thing to compare smoking recreationally in Colorado to smoking medicinally here Someone on one of my teams said that people who use marijuana just tend to do better over the course to treatment so that was nice to hear Ive had a few more headaches that are getting minimally worse Nothing Im worrying about at this point My hair is starting to fall out in little wisps It freaked me out when it started bit of a sobering moment to be staring at a fist full of your hair but Im getting a lot more comfortable with it though and Im happy that Im not losing my eyebrows or anything Figuring out wigs is hard enough I dont think I could handle trying to make eyebrows look realistic too lolol Probably will buzz my head within a week and just switch to wigs and whatnot Its strange bc I wont be completely bald its just where theyre beaming me that I wont have hair growth Get prepped for a strange look and a bunch of ballin ass wigs I have 2 so far I hear random tones in my ears sometimes Also not super concerning but something to note If it becomes a constant thing then its a problem I know I keep saying it over and over but I really am amazed by how many people have been reaching out to me Its clear what kind of community I have around me and I couldnt be more grateful Its looking like when I move back to the twin cities Walker and I will hopefully be roommates somewhere in St Paul VISIT ME everyone plz OH and anyone who has a knack for putting together playlists should make me one to listen to during radiation I get to blast whatever music I want Im open to lots and lots of music Just make a playlist on spotify and let me know the name of the playlist your username,0,0.8731,0

Close to the end lots of feels I realize that my updates have slowed down sorry about that Hopefully this post gives you a good idea of where Im at Im in the middle of week 5of 6 When youre done with radiation its tradition that you ring a bell on the way out of the clinic I am so excited to ring that damn bell They did push back my last day because the hospital is closed on Thanksgiving and I need a certain number of radiation sessions So my last day of radiation is Monday November 27 Cannot come soon enough Yesterday was a lot of appointments I had radiation a care provider visit and a social worker follow up Radiation was fine but Im very frequently exhausted and I literally fell asleep during radiation so that was a little disorienting admittedly kind of funny During my care provider visit we went through my list of medications and coordinated all of that And then my appointment with the social worker was almost like a therapy session We talked about the logistics of my future considering the fact that I need a lot of MRIs in the near future I also learned that most brain patients similar to me only do 5 weeks of radiation SO that was weird to hear I WISH I ONLY HAD 5 WEEKS She also told me about this awesome place further north in MN that has polar bears I must go when treatment is over Im going to be doing my 6 rounds of chemo which start 28 days after nov 17 in St Paul and then Im going to launch from there when this is over I might go back to Chicago or maybe Ill make a random move and nanny for a year and then go to grad school or maybe Ill just go straight to grad school Well see which direction I feel pulled in I like not knowing I cant wait for my life to be unpredictable again I think thats whats been frustrating me recently I am in such a strict routine and I have so many rules that it kind of lowers the level of spontaneity in my life I also realize that Im extremely lucky with how my body is handling this I dont feel terrible every day my chemo is totally fine Im just sleepy I feel that im a very lucky cancer patient in that way I literally havent even really lost weight since this all started Kind of crazy Also have not thrown up still All hail Temozolomide I feel ready to gooooo after maybe a week of sleeping to recover hahaha Love to ALL OF YOU and thank you to my family and friends who have come to visit and spend time with me It helps me so much to have you around me Special shouts to allie allison aaron and cory ali megan haddon jo and obviously my SISTER AND BROTHER MOM AND DAD my fucking home team is the best how did i land with them Idk 3 Also thank you for just checking in with me via text or call The constant support from afar is very much appreciated I love you,0,0.9974,0

Road Trip One of the gifts of being a cancer cabana boy is having the luxury of time to attend to important matters Having left the security of paid employment for the insecurity of sole proprietorship and developing four different lines of business I have also picked up the flexibility of time Time to take Meagan to oncologist visits and scans Time to do research and engage in talks and discussions about the disease and the options moving forward Ive also spent lots of time counseling our boys so they are able to plan and figure out how they respond to their situation What a tough thing to have to do right as you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do and explore all the possibilities life offers you have to deal with a mom who has a scary and unpredictable disease Fortunately through the magic of technology text messaging skype video chats phone calls weve been able to be responsive Both Meagan and I have made it a priority to be there for them when there query process surfaces They are both at different stages due to age and school completion so the challenge for each is unique Casey has decided to withdraw from the University of Colorado to be home and close to his mom during this period of uncertainty Hes planning on working reading exploring future career options and developing a plan for an expected gap year next school year before ultimately returning to college Hes been very thoughtful about this and we support him wholeheartedly I get the pleasure of flying to Boulder today and driving back with him to Seattle on Friday and Saturday Im really looking forward to our discussions and time together a true gift I probably wont post for a couple days although maybe to shake things up a bit I might post some pictures from the road,0,0.8878,0
Road Trip Lessons A very nice two day ride back with Casey from Boulder CO Thus the absence of posts We made excellent time thanks to good weather I did learn the the Best Western Plus in Boulder meant plus noise Not what I was expecting The eastern part of Wyoming is pretty bleak country I had not realized how industrialized Billing MT was it appears to be the coal capital of Montana where coalelectricity Of course we had plenty of time to talk about this change for him and what hes thinking The crisis with Megan is obviously the trigger event but hes also using it as a real opportunity to think through his life and what he wants to be do and how he can have an impact He also doesnt want to have any regrets and being away from Meagan during her treatment was too difficult Im so impressed by his new gravitas and thoughtfulness but one comment stuck out in my mind particularly He said Dad I want to fling myself at life Wow If we could all do that what would our lives be like Cancer has a way of sharpening your thinking and shifting your priorities It certainly has for me although admittedly at my stage of life the priority shift has been about what I need to do to support Meagan In the case of a 19 year old it means something else It means life is short relatively speaking and ones own can be short with respect to expected lifespan there are great adventures and experiences out there the system can pigeonhole you and put you on a track to unhappiness so break the mold step back and decide consciously and carefully what you want to do based on who you are and what your passions are So our job as parents in this case I think is to provide unconditional love and support I expect there will be plenty of self propulsion I am not worried about lack of activity or not taking responsibility for his actions It does mean stepping back and letting him dictate both the process and the direction Offering perspective when asked Helping him understand disease progression or stabilization or remission so he can plan and making sure he will trust me to let him know when he might be needed I cant wait to see where he flings himself,0,0.9959,0
Yervoy Yervoy is the new trade name for Ipilimumab the drug Meagan has been on for her melanoma Shes finished with her course of treatment it was 4 infusions of about 90 minutes each time over a 9 week period She got a scan at the start one at the 12 week mark tumors grew bad sign and has her final 16 week scan this coming week Where do these pharma companies come up with these names Ipilimumab was hard to pronounce and we heard it pronounced about three different ways Even our oncologist just called it Ipi So I get the the need to rename it for their upcoming marketing push But Yervoy How about YerCured YerGonnaBeAlright YerOnTheWaytoNoEvidenceOfDisease or shortened even further YerNearlyNED What the hell does the voy stand for anyway YerVoyage is just starting on our expensive treatment In our case we just hope it means its working,1,-0.7184,0
A Funny Example of the difference in gender We had a funny exchange a while back illustrative of the difference between men and women We had received some not so good news and were in the days following that Clearly emotions were running high between concerned and forward looking to possible treatment options But there are times when you are not researching or talking but simply stewing in your own juices trying to make sense of it all and of course it doesnt make any sense After a few days we were sitting in our cozy little spot and she asked me a question Did you cry today Well as a matter of fact I had not cried THAT particular day I had on an earlier day well maybe teary is more like it I do cry even at sappy commercials and shows I know guys get a bad rap for not crying I certainly felt plenty of emotion THAT day its not like it had gone away But in hearing that question and knowing that I hadnt cried THAT day I instantly felt defensive like I had somehow screwed up and not shown sufficient emotion in light of the gravity of the situation Maybe I wasnt being supportive enough or showing enough vulnerability to match her emotional needs She had definitely cried THAT day as well as pretty much most days I did answer truthfully that I had not cried Then being the much more enlightened guy that I am now instead of just assuming that my initial supposition was correct I asked her why she asked me that question After some pause she responded along the lines of well if you cried I would be much more worried but if you are not crying it must mean you are still positive and convinced we will ultimately prevail Whoops Not crying turned out in this case to be a good thing a supportive thing a thing that enabled her to continue to muster the amazing courage she has shown So instead of feeling defensive I felt better and that my response was indeed reassuring It is a complicated emotional world in which we live,0,0.9947,0
Scan Day Again When you have a chronic disease such as melanoma scans become part of your life Hopefully at some point they become less frequent than our monthly ones at the present Most patients end up getting them quarterly and then managing aspects of the disease ie tumor removal The ultimate goal of course is to become disease free but for melanoma patients currently that is not realistic you simply want to be NED no evidence of disease So you undergo systemic treatments treatments not going after particular tumors but ones that try to ramp up your immune system to go after tumors when they emerge You try one scan some period after if it works and you are NED great if not you move on to another If tumors pop up you manage them The shortterm goal is to buy time until the longterm durable permanent cure is discovered One lesson we have learned from the scans though Have the scans one day and the oncologist visit the next There is a lot of temptation and pressure to find out right away But there needs to be sufficient time for the radiologist to review the scans write the report and for the oncologist to review all that talk with the radiologist before having the conversation with you about results and next actions We crammed it all into one day once and got incomplete information which led to a wrong conclusion which scared the hell out of us It was rectified the next day but we went through needless anxiety So never again Today is scan day Tomorrow is oncologist day,1,-0.899,0

Results days This is not so much about todays results that will likely be tomorrows post but about results days generally There is definitely a heightened tension Part of it is just the sheer frustration of not knowing how much the disease has progressed Another part is starting to think about options what do we do next if it continues to progress and how to tell loved ones Then you also start thinking about what else you could have done Are you seeing the right oncologist yes is it time to go to a specialist center for a consultation are we eating the right things and taking the right supplements Part of what we try to do each result day is to make sure we have our questions outlined today we have about 15 and we gave them to our oncology research nurse yesterday so he could review them and give a copy to our oncologist so he could hopefully review them prior to our inoffice visit We also try to take time to calm each other and do whatever each needs to get centered In Meagans case its usually a walk and Facebook time connecting with friends or answering phone calls and emails I go work out We do talk about the whatifs as we sip our matcha tee and eat our oatmeal We continue to focus on we will prevail even though it could be a bumpy ride We know from past experience weve had results that werent positive and we knew in advance because she had some subcutaneous tumors pop up in between scans What we didnt know was what was happening internally Fortunately so far the internal growth has been minimal The hardest part is thinking about the difference between systemic treatment the stuff that wipes out the cancer and the tumor management Tumor management means surgical removal of tumors or radiology treatment We may have to do tumor management to buy time while we continue to find the holy grail of the right systemic treatment So each result day you are assaulted by all these conflicting emotions and challenging intellectual options considering the results and what they mean And at the end of the day it is usually pretty emotional one way or another relief or scared Certainly telling the kids is hard At that point all you can do is lean on each other and friends and family But it is hard to communicate to all who are concerned and want to know because the more times you tell it the more you can be retraumatized by the news of the day Then you end up feeling guilty for not communicating with everyone But usually mental and emotional exhaustion kicks in and you simply hunker down So lets hope today is good news,0,0.9651,0
Cabana Boy Double Duty I wasnt sure when I started this what Id write about I did know that I didnt intend it to be a blow by blow account or daily version of the journey I guess I hoped it would be more reflective But this morning when the snow is fresh on the ground and we are just off our most recent scan news it seems somewhat appropriate to break pattern and give a live update For those interested read on We got the results of the scan yesterday The disease continues to progress 16 weeks after her initial treatment on Ipilimumab the alleged wonderdrug proved ineffective for Meagan Her lung tumors have grown slightly and there is another tiny one Plus the ones at skin level have grown and there is another tiny one on her arm She got an adjustment in her antihormone medication from something other than Tamoxifen to Fareston sp which does the same thing block estrogen from attaching to your cells but without being affected by antidepressant medications She also got another shot in the butt of Lupron which shuts down your estrogen production but at least its the three month version So the hope is that over the next month her reproductive hormones shut down they did not last month and that she has hot flashes and night sweats that prove it and maybe that might slow the growth as she is very convinced there is a link to her tumor growth and hormones So the doctor is willing to give her a month on that before starting her on the hospitalization treatment Interleukin2 In the meantime we will be taking a trip to the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda Maryland to talk with their melanoma specialists They have over 15 clinical trials on melanoma some of which include using Interleukin2 but adding some other agents Its speculative treatment but thats what we are up for now Interleukin 2 on its own has about a 6 success rate with another 9 getting some short term benefit Doing a clinical trial may prove more effective We will see if any of those look promising for her based on her particular DNA makeup probably have them take some tumors out to use then come back to consult with our home oncologist before making a decision If we do decide to get treatment at the Institute it would be hospital treatment and it would be there Ive done a lot of research and the Institute people are apparently awesome and our oncologist knows the melanoma specialist there and is happy to send us there for consultation But it would be a drag to have to undergo several weeks of treatment there but we will if we have no choice We will still keep our oncologist in Seattle who Meagan loves Because part of buying time until there is a cure is tumor management and we will need him to help make decisions about removal through surgical or radiation means if things progress Needless to say yesterday was pretty rough Given the snow we have we will be hunkering down today just trying to get our emotional legs under us We may double our antidepressant and antianxiety meds today hahahahaha I wish I could say I was exemplary as a cabana boy yesterday But some days it is just shared emotional pain and the best you can do is just hug each other and try to get your balance For those interested here is a link to all the melanoma trials at the National Cancer Institute,0,0.9965,0
Reflections Infections and Inflections Cancer isnt an infection the way a virus is although it feels the same For so many ills and diseases the protocol for cure is well known even though it can be a hard road I remain impressed by the women we see each day at the cancer center getting their blood draws doctor visits and then chemotherapy or radiation treatments Their spirit and determination is admirable I suspect part of what keeps them going is that they have a pretty good idea that the probability of success is quite high Yes they may have to live for 5 years not knowing if the cancer will reoccur But given the treatments and the continuing medications Tamoxifen if you were in Vegas youd bet on their success at becoming disease free Our road is different and more challenging We are now heading down a road of possible treatments which are clinical trials The work and research being done in this area is quite fascinating So many bright minds trying to figure out how to unlock the various keys how to get the right medication through the right pathway to the right spot based on each persons unique DNA So in some ways we have more options now than we thought our next logical step would be and still could be the inhospital treatment with Interleukin2 But we are going to use the failure of the Ipilimumab as an inflection point to go explore some of these promising options Adoptive Cell Therapy is one of the most promising options because it uses a combination of Interleukin 2 with a special sauce They remove a tumor or piece of a tumor to extract some natural tkiller cells from it Then in a lab they see if they can harvest the cells Usually they can sometimes they cant If they see theyre growing they continue to harvest possibly for many weeks until they have about 6 billion of them Then theres a three week procedure where they give them back to you This involves a week of chemotherapy the infusion of your T cells then a week of Interleukin 2 And then you wait and hope that these tcells are abundant enough strong enough and smart enough to recognize the bad stuff and go to town on it The first step is to figure out if Meagan qualifies based on her particular characteristics and mutations we already know she qualifies for a similar trial here in Seattle That will happen when we head to Bethesda for the initial exams tests and scans It would be great if she does qualify But then it means if we agree to do it that the path is different Logistics become more of a challenge Im sure they are quite supportive at their end but still we have a lot on the home front So its a time for reflection on what to do how to go about it who to trust and assessing the potential outcomes and impact We will prevail You pick a path and dont look back You just hope youve got all the right data and perspectives before you make that choice Im confident that when we have the opportunity to choose we will be ready,0,0.9973,0
Drama Fatigue There is something enormously fascinating about the human well lets say male brain Given the enormous stress weve been under the last several days since the latest news its no wonder mines a bit addled The typical male response to stress is fight or flight Clearly a cabana boy cannot do either of those things in this kind of situation So I had to wait a few days Today was cave day I went down to my letterpress studio and did a bunch of mindless sorting storing and transferring of type from one drawer to another Total aside I just got my nine boxes of my new house metal font Caslon in various sizes and types and am swapping those into my good drawers which are right now occupied by obscure fonts and sizes in incomplete or low count letters But Id feel guilty as heck throwing those away so am making the effort to store them properly sorted in most cases in other cases into a bag with just the name and size dealing with that will be for another decade So when the revolution comes Ill be able to print the manifestos when the power and internet are out Now back to our story and point The first job after the cancer news delivery other than steeling myself was continuing to provide steadfast support to Meagan that we can prevail That takes a lot of emotional energy and a lot of willingness to listen Listening well with full empathy and concentration and focus does not come naturally to most guys There were many times over the last few days when I simply wanted to hunker down But thats not what she needed She needed reassurance and connection She also needed information about the National Cancer Institute and the various clinical trial options So I was operating at these two different levels investigator and supporter while the little primal part of my brain was saying run run away Fortunately Ive had a bit of training over the last 9 months Its never easy to stay and do your job but you can be aware at a meta level what your primal instincts are and hit the override button In order to stay sane there does need to be some downtime Sometimes its early in the morning watching first light and just staring Or like today Or watching a mindless game on tv But cabana boy selfcare is a huge part of being in tip top shape to provide the support needed,1,-0.105,0
Health Care Costs This is not really a point of view about the new health care law or attempts to roll it back What I can share is how crazy our system is from the point of view about how insurance does or doesnt work And then the more fundamental point which is about the overall rise in healthcare costs Its very interesting to look at our bills which are really insurance statements and see several things 1 How much some of the scans and surgeries cost as stated by the hospital 2 How much the insurance company reimburses the provider for There is often quite a large difference between the two So you cannot really selfinsure because you would be paying the exorbitant face rates the providers bill instead of the much lower rates the insurance companies pay So I am grateful for insurance coverage just to get the cheaper rate The bigger problem is if you change employers and you have a preexisting condition This employer centered health care system is nuts it ends up locking people into companies because they often cannot afford to leave them If you move from one group plan to another as long as youve been on the program for two years you are ok But you really cannot move from a group plan to private insurance even if you could afford the premiums because they would deny you for preexisting condition If we really want to unlock entrepreneurialism we need to enable people to be able to leave companies and get insurance regardless of preexisting condition Youd think the Republicans would be FOR this kind of incentive wouldnt you Instead we prevent thinkers tinkerers inventors and entrepreneurs from doing it unless they take additional massive risk to selfinsure One thing I learned recently is that roughly 5 of the people insured generate most of the health care costs which drives premium rates and the overall cost of healthcare There is all this talk about bending the health care cost curve and making sure people have high enough copays and deductibles so that they can make smarter choices about the health care ie cheaper choices But based on the statistics most people arent incurring big bills and in a position to have to make those choices They get regular preventative care and then get treated for the normal kind of events that pop up broken arm appendicitis bacterial infection They arent going to look at a menu of choices and say oh Ill take the cheaper option Even if they did it wouldnt affect the overall costs very much at all So what about those 5 who drive the huge health care costs Two sets of people Its people at the end of their lives and the extraordinary measures done to extend life at huge costs and likely not very much quality of life It does make sense to encourage doctors to talk with their patients in advance of those treatments and ask them what they would want based on costs and all the other issues When this got raised by the Dems the charge of death panels came from the Right and the matter was dropped Shame shame shame It is a discussion we need to have The second set are patients like Meagan who have a critical disease Yup we are responsible for one heck of a lot of medical costs in the last 9 months Changing our deductible or copay or showing us a menu of choices and costs wouldnt have made a damn bit of difference Whatever it takes whatever the docs need to make a proper diagnosis and address the issues I am sure everyone would have done the same in our shoes and thus the problem The costs will only be driven down by hospitals and insurance companies collaborating and figuring out bulk purchase arrangements better information transfer and flow preventative schemes and the like The first PET scan machine was darned expensive its cheaper now but it could be way cheaper if the initial order had been in the thousands not tens Lastly I think its a given that health care costs are going to continue to go up and people will be happy about consuming a larger part of their disposable income through premiums and copays in health care Id rather buy fewer things and have better health,0,0.9924,0
Its a Long and Winding Road that leads me to grey hair The twists and turns continue Honestly it seems like just when youve mentally got yourself in order to handle the projected path something comes and and bam it all changes We are learning the difference between FDA approved treatments and clinical trials In order to participate in a clinical trial you typically have to have not had treatment for at least 30 days In some cases you cant have had a certain treatment and in others you can only participate if youve had certain treatments I get why this is so they want to be able to measure the impact of their treatment on the patient and if they are already taking some drug how will they know which worked The thing about approved treatments is a doctor can prescribe them freely So it doesnt matter if you are under a different treatment regimen up until the minute they put you on the next thing The conundrum of course is that you have to be left untreated for a period of time if you want to participate in a clinical trial which means the disease will progress for sure due to the forced time lag So that pretty much sucks As good as the docs and research nurses are they dont know it all and what they think doesnt always turn out right So they end up toying with your expectations I think expectation management is pretty important and right now we have a gap between what we thought would happen and what will likely happen Agility and nimbleness need to be the watchwords for a cabana boy,0,0.9764,0
The Latest Cabana Boy Challenge It turns out that we are not going to be heading to Bethesda anytime too soon We may end up at the National Cancer Institute at some point for participation in one of their clinical trials but not now The drugs Meagan are currently on meant to prevent her hormones from stimulating cancer growth will be in her system for minimally another 30 days and possibly another 90 days depending on whether some of the drugs are classified as cancer fighters plus 30 days after that so the earliest we would go back there would be the first of May and more likely the first of July That being the case we are back to our original plan That plan involved being on these antihormone drugs for the second month through March We then do another set of scans If there is any disease progression then we go the traditional hard route Interleukin 2 which is the two week hospital stay treatment She would start right away Ive learned not go think about things being cast in stone though Maybe the antihormone drugs will work in which case she would stay on them and wed watch Likely they wont have effect so we are preparing ourselves mentally Because life goes on getting it done in April and finding out if it works is better She doesnt want to start in March both to give the antihormone stuff a chance and because she has a weekend concert adventure scheduled in late March with a friend May is Rileys graduation so thats out We are planning on driving down several days before the graduation maybe even taking a bit more time and fly back so Riley can drive the fully loaded car home So the challenge is to help Meagan prepare herself for this upcoming treatment Its scary and there is nothing good written about it She has been online more becoming more educated about treatments and drug interactions which is a good thing Shes the one who discovered the previous link between Tamoxifen and antidepressants which led to the shift in drug type this month So I think having her more educated and empowered is good Its been a gradual process initially I did most of the research and leaked out that which was manageable But as time has gone by and she has come to grips with the situation and her ability and need to assert some control it makes sense for her to get more information without losing her sense of hope and conviction that we will prevail But that means you read the bad and the good So buoying selfconfidence and supporting the belief that she can do this treatment is critical The good news is the treatment will be here in Seattle That means our team will be able to support us and its easier on our young men It also means she needs to put on some real weight the treatment side effects usually lead to weight loss So she needs to start drinking those protein shakes made with coconut milk So I have to build her confidence and nag her to eat more Im grateful that Casey is now home and can help me on the food front hes become very knowledgeable about nutrition thanks to some biology classes and has become an effective and articulate promoter of her eating more So cabana boy has help this month,0,0.9938,0
Cancer Humor Cancer of course is not funny But we have used humor albeit at times macabre to help relieve the tension The power of laughter is well known Im not claiming it can cure cancer but it helps you maintain a positive outlook and every nurse we have talked to have said that the more positive people seem to do better Two humorous things came to mind today one actually happening today First the old event Up at our place at Decatur we often have multifamily potluck meals followed by games One of the games involves a form of charades Guesstures and another has you trying to get your partner to guess a word by you giving hints except you cant use certain words which are the obvious ones This was late August after Meagans cancer diagnosis thought to be breast cancer at the time Now we are a competitive and spirited bunch The action was fast and furious Riley was trying to guess a word and a younger member was giving the clues Suddenly he blurted out for an answer something really far away from the needed word Tropic of Cancer Well of course that set off a whole series of comments and jokes about cancer including Meagan being able to pull the cancer card if she got close but not quite right on a word We all knew she had cancer but hadnt been talking about it and suddenly it was just out there but in a funny appropriate way It helped relieve the tension and led to a lot of laughter Today Meagan was telling me about a visit with an old friend A male friend from high school who she sees maybe once a month His wife has gone through cancer and they have four kids Hes very religious Each time she wants to make sure that I know it is purely platonic I have told her over and over that its fine I am glad she has that relationship and really she doesnt need to keep reassuring me But given that this is the umpteenth time shes qualified this relationship I decided to tweak her a bit So I said honey really if a male friend wants to make a pass at you knowing you have stage 4 metastatic cancer with tumors on your back and stomach and lungs and a big old port a cath the under skin device used for infusions on your upper chest and a series of scars on your back and front I say go for it Her jaw just dropped in complete shock I told her I was just kidding Really I know kinda lame but sometimes the intensity of the situation and context of cancer just calls for a little levity,1,-0.6304,0
A Gift Casey is home for the semester and a gap year and is busy making plans and signing up for classes His presence is and will be a great source of joy and strength as Meagan becomes disease free especially through the nasty bits The gift is this afternoon he said hey do you want to go down to the art museum We could and we did We are fortunate enough to have the time to be able to focus on life and the kids and family and friends and dealing with all aspects of the cancer And we can do things like this,0,0.9625,0
How Can Calm Days Feel So Strange News flashnothing happened to day on the cancer front No new tumors no scan results no appointments Relative calm amongst the troops Casey and I had a fabulous hike up to Twin Falls exit 34 off I90 just past North Bend We did have a chance to talk about the cancer and prognosis and pathways and it was helpful But mostly an enjoyable day So why does an an enjoyable day in some ways make me feel guilty Because there must be something I could be doing Alas not so We have our game plan for March stay the course with the antihormone drugs We have scans scheduled for the end of the month We know the plan for April if there is progression We have Plans D and E National Cancer Institute and Cancer Care Alliance clinical trials for after that The kids are coping Meagan looks fabulous and is eating very well We have a second opinion naturopath visit scheduled for next week with someone who specializes in oncology and the link between conventional and alternative therapy Weve researched the heck out of treatments and side effect management So its a good day But there is that taint in the back of the head Knowing we face a very difficult challenge Wanting to be in the moment and live each day fully and with high quality But it is darn hard Even at the end of the yogatai chipilates class I take a couple days a week and they have the warm down mediation I cannot get the topic out of my head Its like the cosmic background radiation from the Big Bang always there and always making a noise I guess I am not zen enough I do admire those people who are able to empty their minds and be in and of the moment Its not me Probably never will be So I get to enjoy these good days and I genuinely do But they are not free of the worry and concern,0,0.7489,0

So What Do You Do A natural conversation starter at parties But for someone who has left the official workforce thats a question that sets off a whole range of responses to answers and an unleashing of emotions Most guys are defined by what they do not by who they are So if you dont do anything in a paid sense as in work for a firm or have some sort of craft or technical skill that enables you to earn a living the answer you provide can make a big difference in how the evening goes how you feel about yourself and how that person relates to you It also makes a big difference if the asker is male or female Im a cabana boy my wife wife has a serious form of cancer and Ive left the workforce to help her overcome this disease Man oh thats too bad Say I need to go say hello to Jim over there havent seen him in ages will you excuse me You just become irrelevant in their eyes Womens responses are somewhat better but typically aligned around wanting to know more about the cancer and how Meagan is doing Given that it The Big C dominates my life right now its not like I want to hide it My letterpress business is still in its nascent stage RD training studio setup and I dont want characterize myself as a letterpress printer yet Its definitely on the horizon and I am putting the time into it so I suppose soon I can express what I do more in those terms and characterize the cabana boy activities as the sideline But then it seems I am falling back into that trap of defining myself by what I do versus who I am So the disappointment if you can call it that is that there are few men who will engage in the discussion about what it means to be a cabana boy and all the feelings and work associated with that including being empathetic The women instantly gravitate to Meagans plight and wanting to know about treatments and how she is coping So the message is being a cabana boy is largely a thankless and anonymous task except of course for the deep appreciation and acknowledgment of my wife So one needs to develop a coat of armor and recognize that in a society of strivers and achievers and production there is just less value attached to caregivers and supporters especially if you are a guy So thats why the Cabana Boy Union Local is an important group for solidarity Hopefully it stays really small we really dont want to expand We want our wives and partners strong and healthy The meetings are easy to arrange given there is just one member There is little disagreement and getting a quorum is no problem And we are really good at selfreliance and selfsupport The pay is lousy and we dont have much hope for a raise But the benefits are awesome as is the work environment We love our customer So all in all I guess the tradeoff is worth it awkwardness at parties and an irrelevance in the eyes of peer males But happy appreciative customers and a mission unlike no other,0,0.9906,0

I Believe We Have a Game Plan This ordeal has more plot twists than an Agatha Christie mystery We have been mentally prepping for an inhospital treatment of Interleukin2 at the start of next month under the supposition that the next scans scheduled for the 29th of this month will show small hopefully disease progression Wed like to believe the antihormone treatment shes been on would have some chance of success but we know its small so we are being somewhat realistic about what comes next We suspected Kaplan would recommend the Interleukin 2 treatment as it is the last FDA approved treatment available before pursuing clinical trials In the interim we had also thought wed be going to the National Cancer Institute this month to have them check Meagan out and see if any of their clinical trials would be applicable We sorta got shut downput off because she is already undergoing treatment and we THOUGHT she had to wait another 30 days after current treatment completion to even recontact them A call to our research oncology nurse today clarified quite a few things and may have opened up some other options nearterm as well as affirmed our faith they are looking out for our best interest and that it is really important that you be your own advocate Meagan called to confirm the next times and days for the scans and followup with Kaplan Then she discussed more with him about the perceived delay with the Cancer Institute and the desire the get a second opinion before starting the Interleukin2 treatment particularly because we know some of the clinical trials there involve Interleukin 2 after they have done something called Adoptive Cell Therapy taken your killer Tcells out of your body multiplied them by the billions make sure they can target the cancer and then reinject them into you after a chemo treatment Our clinical research nurse clarified the situation After our meeting with Kaplan and review of the scan results if there is growth we can in fact go back to the Cancer Institute right away to get their assessment and clinical trial options Meagan will have completed the antihormone treatment we will have had a recent scan so they can see us and assess as long as treatment starts 30 days after the last treatment Confusing huh But better our nurse will call to make the appointments and make sure the latest scan data is there plus give us a package to take with They will also set up an appointment with the Cancer Care Alliance doc in Seattle who is running a different melanoma clinical trial that we know she qualifies for So hopefully after those visits and discussions with 2 other docs melanoma specialists and their teams and reconvening with Kaplan by midApril we will have some choices and at least the comfort of mind that we are looking at all the viable options Because one of the viable options is to skip the standard Interleukin 2 treatment and go for the clinical trial that still uses Interleukin 2 It takes a while to grow the cells though so one of the things we have to make sure of is that we have the time to make that option work in other words the cancer isnt growing fast We will preclear some things with Kaplan in advance like if hed support the Cancer Institute approach first over conventional we have hints he thinks it is a good option and that if she qualifies and they want to take out some tumors while there wed go ahead knowing we have right to caucus with Kaplan before final decision So lessons learned Make sure you understand your options Dont hesitate to talk to your doc or research nurse about questions and issues Dont hesitate to ask for second opinions Clarify the process involved in clinical trials and when you are eligible to talk to them versus eligible to get treatment If you arent clear after the first discussion call them again and go over it again It does put you on a spin cycle of emotion In some ways you just want to know what the damn treatment is and go for it Throwing more options in the ring causes me stress based on uncertainty and not knowing how to plan logistics etc Its just emotional too because a life is on the line But the benefit of course is maybe more efficacious treatment and maybe fewer rugged treatments she would have to endure because if she failed on the standard IL2 shed definitely do the clinical trial So a trip to Bethesda may be in the works after all,0,0.8345,0

Consistency Two thoughts about this From a Cabana Boy perspective especially as this thing turns into a marathon a good thing I find it harder to maintain consistent support I probably do in reality but sometimes I realize that a few days have slipped by and they are days we havent had to deal with anything so as a result Ive not had to be on point and constantly addressing the issues They are certainly there as the 8 pound elephant in the room But aside from some chit chat first thing in the morning and a little pillow talk at night I may not be addressing the emotional needs of my client Life can feel kind of normal and so one naturally falls into old patterns So part of the learning is being proactive about checking in and making sure Meagan is feeling ok as ok as she can and what I need to do to help her It takes an act of will given that the events arent driving it The other thing is just how amazing her support network of friends and family are and how consistent they are about checking in and sending her funny things or dropping her notes and cards The volume isnt quite what it was which is understandable but it is still most impressive how people are able to maintain their support It matters too Meagan delights in getting that support and interaction aside of course from her famous addiction to Facebook,0,0.9956,0
The Four Legs of the Chair These four components make up the legs of the chair on which we are sitting to get Meagan disease free Given we have been fortunate to dodge the vicious blow of melanoma that strikes fast and hard and leaves little time we are engaged in all of these areas In terms of conventional treatment and well include Ipilimumab now known as Yervoy in that category we have just about hit all the logical ones The one remaining treatment Interleukin 2 is on the horizon But it may be that we undergo a clinical trial which incorporates Interleukin 2 within the protocol instead of a stand alone treatment Because that treatment is really nasty involving a multiweek hospitalization Wed rather do it in Seattle with our support network in place But that would be for the stand alone treatment only or possibly a clinical trail More likely wed do it at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda Conventional treatment does not just include systemic treatments to try to rid you of the disease A systemic treatment is like chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer that eradicates all evidence of it at even the cell level Even if the systemic conventional treatments dont work there is the continuing option of tumor removal until there is a breakthrough and a systemic cure is discovered Many melanoma patients live this way and some who have done so are now experiencing the benefits of those breakthroughs such as with Yervoy Ipilimumab Given the unfortunate failure of Ipilimumab Yervoy to work for Meagan we are heading to the clinical trial route There is still a lot of reason for optimism in this path The latest direction is Adoptive Cell Therapy extracting your own bodies Tcells those cancer fighting cells and multiply them by the billions and then reinfusing them into your body along with a dose of conventional drugs like Interleukin 2 There are all sorts of variations on the theme depending on your particular DNA makeup and there continues to be new drug development So as long as we can buy time through tumor removal or partial success with the various therapies or simply slow growth we have a great shot at beating this Most long term survivors of melanoma and Im talking LONG TIME have participated in some way in clinical trials It doesnt mean you are a lab rat or that you are in randomized trials where you might not get a drug they think works There are many Phase 1 or 2 trials not ready for submission to the FDA for approval and not ready for broad testing available Sorting out which ones make sense and which ones keep you eligible for future ones in the event of lack of success is what we rely on our team for Because melanoma is an immune system cancer it just seems to make sense to get your body in tip top immune system shape Meagan has already plunged into that with her change in food sources and exercise and certain supplements Next week we visit a naturopath who is working at the intersection of conventional and alternative medicine in oncology to get her perspectives on what else we should be doing Its pretty clear most oncologists even those specializing in melanoma take a somewhat dim view of the power of foods and natural herbs and supplements to support disease control or eradication Yet there is plenty of evidence that certain foods and herbs exert powerful influences on your immune system Up until now we have really lacked that integrated view of the conventional and alternative avenues and wed like there to be some coherence and someone looking at her holistically But we are not so beyond the fence that we will go to the clinics Tijuana for the bizarre Lastly is the power of attitude Ive written about this before Quality of life is really important You dont have to be in denial about the severity of the disease to hold positive thoughts in your head and a belief in an optimistic outcome We say to each other or maybe I say it more to her when she wavers we will prevail Meagan is living her life right now the way she wants surrounded by friends and family and drawing on the strength and energy of those around her Every person faces their own mortality in different ways after all life is a terminal disease its not a question of if but a question of when Some people when faced with more imminent signs of possible early demise opt for knocking off a bucket list of activities Thats fine but not who Meagan is or we are as a couple For us life is about being who we are living where we are surrounded by people we love and care about Couple that with a positive attitude and we think that will be the magic ingredient that works with all the other aspects to see us through to becoming disease free,0,0.9952,0

Meltdowns You never know what might trigger it Meagan has done such a fantastic job being positive energetic optimistic and hopeful that when it comes its always a bit of a surprise and a conundrum And a time for cabana boy to leap into action Instinctively the best thing to do is just hug and hold her and reassure Depending on what the trigger is though what you say matters Weve had some meltdowns based on general information or news ie someone we are acquainted with dying of cancer In other cases its been based on reading or hearing some specific piece of news or discovery that might be related directly to her cancer So its a pretty stressful time An understatement I usually try to reassure her with information reminding her about the course of her particular type of cancer the advances being made in places like the National Cancer Institute and how the discovery of her particular mutation may lead to more productive treatment Then I remind her of her mantras shes a warrior ninja princess and shes young strong healthy except for the cancer Then its on to using the metaphor developed for her about putting the fear the bully back in the box padlocking it and putting it away Then we try to focus on what is good about life enjoying each and every day taking it one step at a time and not looking down the road at whatifs Reminding her to breathe and then trying to lighten things up last night it was my imitation of the character in the movie Hook trying to get Peter Pan Robin Williams to think happy thoughts Peter She has to do the heavy lifting and regain her balance and she always does Shes a remarkable woman,0,0.9631,0
Turkey Tail Mushrooms Went to our long awaited appointment with the oncology naturopath at Bastyr University yesterday Adding to the anticancer team Many pros and cons about this First the cons It seems that almost every new visit weve had with a doctor or oncologist or naturopath has started off on the wrong foot Why Because they have you fill out all this information in advance maybe have your records sent over from your primary doc or oncologist but when you walk in to see the doc for the first time it is VERY clear they havent read it In this case the administrative staff didnt even have it pulled together although Meagan had faxed it last week They said they didt have the latest blood work so I called over and got it sent over only to have the staff person come back and say oh I found it anyway Its kind of a joke actually if this was an interview with an attorney or accountant Id walk away from them ASAP They rely on their wisdom and quick ability to assess based on asking questions already answered in the damn advance questionnaires and a regular protocol they follow for standard treatment It just shows for me how important it is for the team cancer patient and cabana boy to make sure the story gets told in the right way and in the right order right away so the doc can make a good assessment In other words you have to help them do a good job You cant assume theyve read it in advance You have to be your own advocate The good news is that our naturopath does seem to have a wealth of knowledge and has prescribed some medicinal plants one of which Meagan was already taking but in a much higher dose One of those is Turkey Tail Mushrooms If you click on the link above it will take you to an article about the alleged benefits My attitude right now is that the medical world so far hasnt found an answer so if taking something which is nontoxic and nonharmful could have a benefit why not I do know the major drug companies are scouring the rain forests for herbs and plants and now fungi for the next blockbuster drugs which they will patent and manufacture Potent high profit drugs like Taxol came from the yew tree She is also suggesting another treatment high dose Vitamin C but she is going to connect with our oncologist to see if hes ok with it I think her goal and that of Bastyr is to be more integrated with Western medicine It will be interesting to hear Kaplans response,0,0.9956,0
I Read it in Oprah Yes I do browse through Meagans monthly Oprah magazine Ive found some good vegetarian recipes in it and some health articles which have been helpful and corroborate information weve received elsewhere In the most recent edition there is an article from a woman who has ovarian cancer which reflected our experience and the direction cancer treatment is heading Essentially she got the standard treatment for ovarian cancer chemo radiation but then started wondering why the treatment wasnt customized to her DNA So she started a foundation that is helping ovarian cancer patients get their genetic profile and then matching clinical trials to the various mutations they might have This is right in line with where weve been heading Standard treatments didnt work the standard treatments for melanoma are not particularly effective anyway and the latest drug Ipilimumab is a general purpose solution that although more effective initially for many patients did not work for Meagan The latest thinking around cancer is to customize the treatment based on DNA profile not the location from whence it started So we are heading down the clinical trial route likely starting at the National Cancer Institute in very early April right after her scan scheduled for late March Which clinical trial we will be eligible for will be a function of a few things some of which we know and some of which we dont We do know some are based on particular mutations you have and we know for sure she has one type that they are targeting But they also are using different mechanisms to deliver the drugs some are vaccine based and some are infusion based They have multiple trials running The question is who is going to be looking out for our best interest and say this is the right trial for you given your history and mutations and keeping the most options open for down the road if it doesnt work When you look at the clinical trials there are many principle investigators and all the studies are recruiting volunteers I dont want us recruited into a trial just because they need a few more numbers in that trial I want Meagan in a trial that is right for her So we will be prepared to advocate on our own behalf with some advance discussion with Dr Kaplan in hand Im also going to prepare a one page summary of Meagans disease and treatment history to hand to each person we discuss her condition with under the theory they wont have read her file I know Im cynical Ill also prepare a list of questions for the Institute people when it comes to deciding which trial makes sense I think we are long past the days when doctors were authoritarian figures and you did what they said without discussion In our territory its clearly uncharted waters they know a little but they dont know you that well and its important that you take ownership and control of the situation Its not that we arent grateful for the opportunity or the work they are doing It just needs to be a partnership with a balance of power and decisions based on mutual concurrence,0,0.7704,0
Ipilimumab thoughts after treatment One of the questions people are asking on one of the melanoma discussion boards I frequent is does presence of side effects indicate the drug is working Ive been pretty clear when Ive chosen to respond The answer is no Meagan had side effects admittedly the mild ones compared to the thrashing your body can take from Ipilimumab if it really kicks in to gear Meagans side effects were pronounced prolonged itching all over which persists to this day which is about 20 weeks out from initial treatment The side effects are all related to your immune system kicking into high gear and confusing healthy cells and parts of the body for cancer cells But that does not mean they are also kicking butt on the cancer cells The drug could still be blind to the cancer cells I feel like Im throwing cold water on some of the questioners who are clearly elated they are having side effects so it must be working But the facts indicate otherwise,1,-0.2144,0
Expectation management So we had our naturopath visit on Monday Meagan received two new supplements to take which I outlined in an earlier post One of the treatments discussed was high dose intravenous delivered Vitamin C We got a long explanation of the curative powers of Vitamin C and how it affects cancer tumors and cells When we left the naturopath was going to email and contact our oncologist to get his buyin That was Monday about 1pm Its now Thursday and weve heard nothing Nothing from either part of the team Professionally wouldnt you think someone would get back to you with either the information about when to come in for treatment or that our oncologist didnt think it was a good idea or that they had been unable to connect but would keep trying Especially after they had been touting the wonders of this particular treatment and setting expectations And knowing we are likely leaving town right after the scans on the 30th and probably will be instructed to stay off all treatments and supplements until the National Cancer Institute clinical trial she participates in The naturopath also made many statements about the alleged efficacy and speed at which the various supplements would work Not might work Would work How professional or smart is that They arent the ones who have to deal with the emotional stress and swings if it doesnt work Youd think they would be a bit more circumspect to manage expectations and emotions Such as if it works heres what to expect If it works here is when you might see results But it might not work At least then you arent walking out high on a cloud of high expectations only to have them dashed But they arent there to deal with the fallout Thats the cabana boys job So next time health care professional I am going to hold you to a professional standard about expectation management,1,-0.5023,0

11 Tips to Get Through Chemotherapy This is one of the best articles I have read on how to get through chemotherapy and healthy ways to manage its side effects I have posted the link above but for anyone who is too lazy to click on it here it is 11 Tips to Get Through Chemo By Jennifer Griffin 1 Get your teeth cleaned before you start because you cant get them cleaned during chemo and you tend to get mouth sores You can minimize these by brushing your teeth three to five times a day and rinsing with a mild mouthwashI use a mild dry toothpaste and mouthwash called Biotene baking soda and saltwater gargles work as well 2 Get your wigs nowfind a really cute fun one or two and go with your girlfriends before you start losing your hair Have fun with itno one in Hollywood wears their own hairthey are ALL wigs I am a redhead right now and never was before and love it I dont know about the drugs you are taking but the typical chemo drugs cause your hair to fall out on day 14 to 17 Shave it off before it starts falling out its much more empowering that way Invite your girlfriends to do it with you Plan to have lunch somewhere fun afterward Embrace it Bald is very powerful but remember to get a hat a fuzzy fleece onebecause bald is also breezy and you will catch drafts that you didnt even know existed You need to sleep in the fuzzy hat all the time I like to wear cute knit hats over the wigs because they look a little less wiggy and a little more young Let your friends throw a hat party for youlike a baby shower but with hats 3 Get some nice body lotion and lip balm because the chemo dries out your skin On the flip side chemo is better than Botox and takes all the toxins out of your skin Suddenly your face is as smooth as a babys butt 4 Get some powder bronzer so that when your face looks pale and drawn and a little green from the drugs you can throw on a little extra bronzer powder and blush and feel that you dont look like a cancer patient There is a reason the American Cancer Society has what is called the Look Good Feel Better campaign because if you get up each morning and shower and put on your blush and your wig you literally feel better It is so easy to start the downward spiral into feeling sorry for yourself Theres a great title of a book Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy My husband Greg once asked me why I was getting so dolled up After all he said we were just going to chemo I told him that was exactly why I was putting on lipstick and a bright scarf and great earrings Its your body armor Dont go out without it Every time I have I have regretted it 5 Get some clothes that are your chemo uniform I went to Max Mara and got comfy leggings long cozy sleek sweaters furry boots like Uggscashmere everything Anything to make you feel cozy and sporty All easy to throw on so you just reach in your closet and grab your uniformtaking all the stress out of what to wear 6 Immediately order from Amazon two cookbooks by Rebecca Katz a San Francisco chef The Cancer Fighting Kitchen and One Bite at a Time Tell your friends about them so they can cook healthy things for you that help with the chemo side effects and not bring you doughnuts and cakes to make you feel better I remember at the first group session at my hospital the women were all going around introducing themselves and consistently they talked about having gained weight through chemo One woman said she had gained 70 pounds The drugs and the steroids can cause havoc to your metabolism so its best to try to find a reasonable but pretty strict eating regime to give your body and immune system the strength it needs to fight and bounce back Your mouth will feel like Chernobyl pretty quickly and your taste buds die so there are tricks in Rebecca Katzs books to make food still taste appealing and to stimulate your appetite so you can stay strong Certain foods definitely boost your immune system 7 I immediately eliminated all processed foods all white sugar and nearly all dairy Triple negative responds well to a very lowfat diet To be a vegan is ideal but you will find that when you get anemic during the chemo you may have to bend the rules a bit on meatat least that is what I have found and was tucking into some veal shank for the marrow at midnight last night Also a lowglycemic diet is very good for triple negative because there is some research that shows that triple negative may have something to do with insulin levels 8 I drink only water bubbly water and green tea I dont want the sugars in the other drinks I put lemon in and on everythingit cuts through the chemical taste and you need 3 quarts of water a day to wash the chemicals through your system Staying hydrated also keeps you from being nauseated They recommend three to six mugs of green tea a day to get maximum benefit from the antioxidants in the tea Start eating all organic Check out Jane Plant British geologists book on how she survived breast cancer by giving up dairy 9 Dont touch any milk eggs or meat that have any hormones in them I still eat eggs and fish but only wildcaught fish like salmon and white fish I dont want the swordfish and other things that are higher up the food chain because they have a lot of mercury 10 Eat a lot of cabbage Cancer hates cabbage When you are eating this clean detoxed diet filled with superfoods you are going to be as strong as you can be to counter the tsunamilike effects of the weekly biweekly or triweekly chemo treatments Its like girding yourself to take each wave headonlike body surfing And even those days when you dont feel great go out for a walk Dont miss your exercisethe oxygen and endorphins will help so so much And eat like a pregnant woman overcoming morning sicknesssmall meals five times a day Dont let your stomach get empty it helps counter the nausea Sleep with a banana by the side of your bed and a pitcher of water Hydrate all night long and have the banana in case you are feeling a little queasy first thing in the morning Demand that your doctor give you a wonder drug called Emendbest antinausea drug on the market Insist on it Look into getting chia seeds from your health food store or online They are flax on steroids They are wonderful on your oatmeal in the morning and have all the omega3s you need plus fiber and calcium 11 Ginger is the best natural antinausea food Chop fresh ginger into everything Eat it raw Make tea from it It got so desperate the other day I went straight from the gym to a nearby sushi restaurant to eat a mound of pickled ginger because it was the only thing I could think of to settle my stomach To read the entire article,0,0.9992,0

Looking for Non Scale Victories For the 3rd week in a row I have lost approximately 1 lb Week after week my doctor nutritionist and personal trainer have assured me that I am doing everything right and need to wait a little longer for my body to adjust to my new lifestyle If it takes any longer I am going to scream I am going to try and start looking for non scale victories to keep me going Everyone tells me Ive lost inches but I have never measured myself before This is mostly due to the fact that I larger than most measuring tape and it is highly embarrassing to stand there with a big gap at your hips when the tape ends wont meet Today my trainer did measure me so I can look at it the next time the scale disappoints me Here is goes Neck 16 inches Bicep 23 inches Forearm 15 inches Chest 58 inches Smallest waist under my boobs 53 inches Natural waist 60 inches Hip 69 inches Thigh33 inches Calf24 inches Cankle 15 inches Total inches I did have a small victory this morning This nutritionist wanted me to eat some peanut butter with a banana before I did my heavy duty workout with my trainer I tried it but the peanut was so sweet I couldnt eat it It was seriously gross to me As a girl who loves her sweets this is definitely an accomplishment in changing my eating patterns I was a little proud of myself,0,0.9066,0

Im healing right now There are many ideas thats my way of being nice lol on what should be done once you leave a relationship get over somebody by getting under somebody new get revenge get back with an ex because youre lonely NOTHING will erase the hurt pain or memories Rather it was your fault his fault yall fault You should do this before doing ANYTHING else HEAL Why Because the last thing you want to do is get into another relationship with emotional baggage just to kill what couldve been a great love if you were in the right mindset and emotional stance I read this quote today while scrolling through Facebook Ive always been the girl to jump in a relationship after relationship Ive always kinda sought after someone else to validate me make me feel important and felt like a strong connection needed to be chased But is it healthy and will it benefit me and my mental health in the long run Hell no So Im doing things different this time Im fixing myself where Ill be able to give someone again not a mere 75 Im letting myself heal from a recent relationship where we talked about living together getting a dog together and someone I truly loved Im not going to move on as if it never existed and bury it so it can come back later Instead I am healing I am not jumping back into another relationship right away because thats completely not healthy in my eyes I am not going to go to the next so easily and bring my doubts my trust issues I now have thanks to my last relationship and the one prior and hinder a relationship that could be something great just because Im not yet Instead if I am lonely I am going to sit in my loneliness Im going to discover why I feel that way and Im going to work on myself so I dont get in another relationship just because I feel like I need one Respect means a lot to me And whoever I choose to bring in my life next I want to show that same respect I ask for from them by being in the best place for another relationship It wouldnt be fair to the next person if I only gave half of me Itll be some time Im healing right now,0,0.9853,0

A New Beginning hoechemo A New Beginning Dedicated to Caregivers Written by Aura Brickler in response to a journal prompt on April 13 My new beginning has yet to happen I dont know much about it but I know it will come with a bang I know it will hurt like hell even though I have braced myself for years Some days it feels like I sit and wait for it daydreaming about what it will feel like It can show up like a slow motion video of a head on collision as a family comes into focus I realize it is ours Other times it looks like a storm way off in the distance a disastrous cloud over an Idaho mountain range while were being spared a few last rays of the suns light When it happens I will scream and cry and whisper to myself but you had so much time to prepare I will begin again in a suffocating state of mourning I will smile at others and assure them that I am okay I will agree that hes better off not suffering that he is no longer laboring to find each and every single breath I will hope with all of my might that there is an afterlife one that has offered him eternal peace after so much pain I will begin again wanting more than ever to believe in the narrative of heaven because what else do you tell your young child about where her father goes when his body dies I will likely tell her that he lives among the stars now always hovering over her and when the night sky is the darkest shell see him the most I will begin again as someone with a lot of regrets The idea of living every day as if it is the last fades after days of trying hard to do so Cancer has a way of digging in and dragging along It grabs you by your weaknesses and makes you beg for an ounce of strength It gnaws at the foundation of your collective hopes and dreams allowing despair to fill in the cracks I will begin again and learn how to forgive I will begin again as a narrator telling stories to keep him close to us Telling tall tales that protect our daughter from the parts of the story that are too painful I imagine being left in a fog of uncertainty fear and confusion When the fog begins to lift I will begin again as grateful for what we had and what of him I still have I will begin each day like I do now with a cup of coffee I will begin again as a widow In loving memory of my husband Bret Hoekema who traded suffering for surrender on January 6th He left us too soon but his presence carries on with such tenacity that he will never be just a memory I cannot imagine the pain of this loss Thats not quite true I absolutely can imagine it which is why it hits me so hard Ive had friends who have lost partners and Ive lost dear friends Cancer has a way of digging in and dragging along It grabs you by your weaknesses and makes you beg for an ounce of strength It gnaws at the foundation of your collective hopes and dreams allowing despair to fill in the cracks God I hate this disease I live mostly now in the land of remission My diagnosis and treatment a not so distant memory I am constantly aware of it in my rear view mirror Im aware of how lucky we were and still are to still be here And then I think of those that werent so lucky and I know Ill never truly outrun it but Ill take a part of them with me as I go,1,-0.9497,0

Low Incidence of CTE Found Among US Service Members MedicalResearchcom Interview with Daniel Perl MD Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Professor of Pathology at USUHS and Director of the CNRMs Brain Tissue Repository Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Bethesda Maryland MedicalResearchcom What is the background for this study Response Chronic traumatic encephalopathy CTE is a brain disorder that is predominantly seen in individuals who have suffered from repeated impact head trauma such as occurs in former boxers or American football players CTE has very specific alterations in the brain and can only be diagnosed at autopsy Some have claimed that in addition to former contact sport participants individuals who served in the military and were repeatedly exposed to blast explosions are also at increased risk for developing CTE However this claim has been based on a rather small number of anecdotal cases The DoDUSU Brain Tissue Repository is the only facility in the world that is exclusively dedicated to the collection and study of donated brain specimens derived from deceased active duty and retired service members We used the resources of this facility to examine consecutively collected brain specimens for the presence of CTE This would to provide a view of how common CTE was in this setting and when diagnosed was the disease correlated with prior blast exposure participation in contact sports and other forms of head trauma and with certain forms of symptomatology such as development of PTSD alcoholsubstance abuse death by suicide etc MedicalResearchcom What are the main findings Response Of the brains examined from military personnel we found only 10 specimens which showed neuropathologic features diagnostic of CTE and of those identified cases involvement of the brain by the disease tended to be rather minimal eg half showed only one CTErelated lesion despite extensive sampling All of the identified cases diagnosed with CTE had a history of participation in contact sports in addition to their having served in the military It would appear from our data that CTE is uncommon among military personnel and that exposure to repeated blast does not represent a substantial risk factor for the development of the disease MedicalResearchcom What should readers take away from your report Response That chronic traumatic encephalopathy CTE is rather rare in US service members and when seen it tends to be rather mild in terms of brain involvement and it is typically associated with prior participation in contact sports especially football If we could find only 10 cases of CTE among brain specimens examined in a young active mostly male population this suggests that this disease is not as common as is frequently claimed in the general civilian active male population While we could not claim that the cohort studied reflects the makeup of the general civilian population or the military for that matter if in this group of mostly male active and relatively young individuals who are those who sign up to serve in the military we could only document a diagnosis of the disease in 44 and remember half of the cases had very minimal involvement of the brain only one CTErelated lesion could be documented in the brain samples then we believe this says something about overall risks in people who never played contact sports professionally Additionally our data indicate that CTE was not a significant contributor to prominent sequelae commonly seen in service members such as PTSD alcoholdrug abuse or suicide MedicalResearchcom What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work Response We need to continue the collection and study of additional donated brain specimens that are derived from both symptomatic and nonsymptomatic service members in order to better understand the effects of a military career on brain health our DoDUSU Brain Tissue Repositorys overall mission MedicalResearchcom Is there anything else you would like to add Response Yes most of the individuals studied in this reports who were most heavily exposed to combat especially blastexposed died at a relatively young age Studies of CTE in contact sport athletes show that there is a considerable period of latency between when they are exposed to head trauma during their athletic careers and when they become symptomatic with the disease This period of latency can be several decades in duration There are many examples of former NFL players who had successful business careers success in sports casting etc for extended period of time before finally becoming symptomatic with CTE later in life We can only report our data on the cases we have available to examine In coming years we may identify additional cases of CTE in former service members who served in the 20 year period of the War on Terror to and who were so extensively exposed to blast Only time and further studies will tell We have no financial disclosures to report Citation Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in the Brains of Military Personnel David S Priemer MD Diego Iacono MD PhD C Harker

Lupus Awareness Month Award Winners Will Improve Diversity in Clinical Trial Landscape Dr Bacalao Dr Maria Bacalao MD Assistant Professor Department of Internal Medicine UT Southwestern Medical Center Dr Williams Dr Jessica Williams MD MPH Assistant Professor of Medicine Division of Rheumatology Emory University School of Medicine As winners of the The Robert A Winn Diversity in Clinical Trials Award Program Drs Bacalao and Williams discuss the challenges of diagnosing treating and research into the autoimmune disorder of Lupus MedicalResearchcom Would you briefly explain what is meant by lupus Are there different types ie SLE discoid lupus druginduced etc Dr Bacalao Lupus is a systemic autoimmune condition in which patients make antibodies against their own genetic materials leading to tissue damage in various organ systems There are several kinds Systemic lupus erythematosus a condition in which the immune system affects various organs such as the skin lungs kidneys bone marrow nervous system Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Lupus that is limited to the skin but does not affect other organs Drug induced lupus drug induced lupus is similar to systemic lupus but it is a reaction to a particular drug Neonatal Lupus a rare condition in which the antibodies from a mother with lupus affect the fetus leading to the baby developing transient symptoms of lupus Dr Williams Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects approximately 15 million people in the United States In lupus the immune system develops antibodies against the bodys own tissues leading to inflammation that can affect multiple organ systems There are four major types of lupus including systemic lupus erythematosus SLE cutaneous lupus druginduced lupus and neonatal lupus SLE is the most common type of lupus and can affect any organ system Cutaneous lupus is limited to the skin and includes discoid lupus which can lead to scarring Druginduced lupus is caused by certain prescription drugs such as hydralazine a blood pressure medication Neonatal lupus is rare and may affect infants of women who have lupus MedicalResearchcom How is lupus diagnosed and what are the common clinical presentations Dr Bacalao The diagnosis of lupus is complex and there is no laboratory test that conclusively diagnoses the condition Rheumatologists usually use blood tests physical exam and Xray results to diagnose lupus Rheumatologists look for Rashes in sunexposed areas of skin such as a malar or butterfly rash Joint tenderness and swelling Ulcers in mouth or nose Positive antibodies such as the ANA Smith and DS DNA blood test Blood and protein in the urine Hair thinning Low white blood cell counts Symptoms of heart and lung inflammation like chest pain or shortness of breath Other symptoms concerning of Lupus like fatigue and unexplained fever Unexplained neurological symptoms like seizures confusion strokes Dr Williams Lupus is diagnosed through a combination of historical and present symptoms physical examination findings such as rashes or joint inflammation laboratory tests including autoantibodies and imaging tests such as a chest xray There is no single test that can diagnose lupus Common symptoms of lupus include fatigue fevers rashes especially a butterfly rash on the face or a rash after sun exposure pain or swelling in the joints hair loss sores in the mouth or nose and chest pain when taking a deep breath Lupus may also present with low blood counts kidney disease or central nervous system disease MedicalResearchcom Does the clinical presentation and course differ among racialethnicgender groups Dr Bacalao Black Lupus Patients are over twice more likely to develop kidney disease and over times more likely to develop end stage renal disease than nonHispanic White patients This has not changed in a decade Asian patients have the highest lupus nephritis prevalence Black patients are also diagnosed on average 14 years earlier than White patients Indigenous patients had a life expectancy of 50 years vs 64 years for white patients Dr Williams Lupus is more common in women of childbearing age 90 of cases and nonwhite patients twothirds of cases Nonwhite patients and males have more severe disease and worse outcomes MedicalResearchcom Is there a familial predisposition Dr Williams Yes Lupus is more common in patients who have a family history of lupus or another autoimmune disease If a twin develops lupus there is a 30 chance that their identical twin will also develop lupus and a chance that their fraternal twin will develop lupus MedicalResearchcom Are there public health disparities that limit access to health care for black women particularly those of limited financial means Dr Bacalao Yes there are factors that lead to decreased access to healthcare for Black women and other women of Color Institutional racism such as food deserts lack of societal neighborhood investment also represent significant psychosocial stressors for many BIPOC patients with Lupus Neighborhood poverty was also linked with increased damage accrual and mortality which improved when patients exited poverty All of these factors cause decreased access to healthcare Dr Williams Yes the lack of universal access to healthcare in the United States disproportionately impacts Black women who are more likely to be of lower socioeconomic status and thus uninsured or underinsured MedicalResearchcom Is there adequate representation of black women in research studies Dr Bacalao The belimumab clinical trial participants were only 14 percent African American and 20 percent Latino However the majority of Latino participants were from Latin America around 80 In the general population of patients with Lupus 40 are African American 38 NonHispanic White 15 Latino 4 Asian Dr Williams Black patients are significantly underrepresented in lupus clinical trials For example Black patients comprise 43 of prevalent cases of lupus but only 14 of lupus clinical trial participants MedicalResearchcom Is there hesitancy to participate in clinical trials among some individuals and ethnic groups Dr Bacalao Yes there is some hesitancy from minority groups but when given the chance participation among African Americans and Latinos is actually significant Dr Williams Yes Due to historical injustices in medical research such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study as well as ongoing structural racism and bias in the United States healthcare system some nonwhite patients are hesitant to participate in clinical research due to fear of experiencing harm MedicalResearchcom What is the mission of the DCTCDP Dr Bacalao The Robert A Winn Career Development Award Winn CDA is a 2year program designed to support the career development of earlystage investigator as defined by NIH physicians underrepresented in medicine and physicians who have a demonstrated commitment to increasing diversity in clinical research to become independent clinical trial investigators who are engaged in advancing health equity through their research and mentoring Dr Williams The mission of the DCTCDP is to increase diversity in cancer cardiovascular and immunologic clinical trials to achieve equitable representation ensure that all patients have access to innovative treatments and confirm that new treatments are safe in all groups The DCTCDP also aims to train earlycareer clinical trialists to conduct trials with a focus on community engagement and health equity MedicalResearchcom How do you hope to increase diversity in clinical studies and improve access to health care for underrepresented communities Dr Bacalao I am currently working on an educational curriculum to help increase diversity in clinical trials Dr Williams I am currently enrolling patients in lupus clinical trials at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta Georgia which is a safetynet hospital that serves predominantly Black patients with lupus Many of the patients at our site are uninsured or underinsured and the availability of clinical trials significantly enhances the treatment options for the patient population that I serve I am also studying clinical trial perceptions and barriers among the Georgians Organized Against Lupus GOAL Cohort a populationbased cohort of predominantly Black patients with validated lupus These findings will be used to propose interventions to increase Black patient participation in lupus clinical trials Dr Williams I would like to thank the DCTCDP for providing me with the necessary training and support to become a leader in equitable lupus clinical trials I am also grateful for my wonderful patients that teach me so much every day and I hope that one day soon we will have a cure for lupus Background on Female American Physicians in The Robert A Winn Diversity in Clinical Trials Award Program Dr Maria Bacalao Dr Bacalao is a physician who was born and raised in Venezuela and came to the US at 13 years old Through the DCTCDP program she hopes her clinical research will help to develop new therapeutic modalities for systemic lupus erythematosus SLE Dr Bacalao has shared that it is particularly difficult to treat lupus since it mostly affects women and women of color and current treatmentstrials do not necessarily take this into account Dr Bacalao hopes to change misconceptions around clinical trials and help address barriers including education and communication Additionally Maria is part of a nonprofit called Literacy of Chiefs which helps empower and reduce the language barrier immigrants face Dr Jessica Williams Being AfroLatin Dr Jessica finds a social justice element in her clinical research surrounding lupus which is more prevalent in women and severe in patients of color Currently her trials through the DCTCDP program consist of two components a Phase II study of a monoclonal antibody and an annual survey on patient perceptions of clinical trials through the GOAL coalition Additionally she is working on the best way to set up a clinical trial at her site and later create a protocol for other underresourced areas to do the same The information on MedicalResearchcom is

regions currently affecting 1 in every 10 children and 1 in every 3 children with obesity in the US The rate of pediatric NAFLD has more than doubled in recent decades following the epidemic rates also noted for childhood obesity There is increasing interest in the role that environmental chemical exposures may play in NAFLD etiology since several animal studies have shown that prenatal exposures to endocrinedisrupting chemicals EDCs cause liver injury and damage but until now the potential effects of prenatal EDC mixture exposures in pediatric NAFLD had not been studied MedicalResearchcom What are the main findings Response In this study we measured 45 chemicals in the blood or urine from 1 pregnant women from six European countries and found that maternal exposure to several environmental chemical exposures may play in NAFLD etiology since several animal studies have shown that prenatal exposures to endocrinedisrupting chemicals commonly used in consumer and industrial products increases risk for NAFLD in the child Environmental chemical exposures may play in NAFLD etiology since several animal studies have shown that prenatal exposures to endocrinedisrupting chemicals are known to interfere with the hormone systems and pass through the placenta from the mother to the fetus altering fetal programming and development Examples of chemicals we investigated include perfluoroalkyl substances PFAS also known as forever chemicals used in nonstick cookware and food packaging and polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDEs used as flame retardants in furniture and infant products Other chemical classes we studied include pesticides plastics and toxic metals When the children reached the ages of 6 to 11 years old we measured the levels of liver enzymes and cytokeratin18 that indicate risk for NAFLD in the childrens blood finding elevated levels of those biomarkers in children who had been more highly exposed to environmental chemicals and especially to persistent organochlorine pesticides PFAS PBDEs and metals during pregnancy MedicalResearchcom What should readers take away from your report Response It is important to be aware of the health risks that endocrinedisrupting chemicals pose for the mother and the developing fetus and possible ways to avoid these exposures Some effective ways in reducing exposure to EDCs in pregnancy and early childhood include avoiding the use of products that contain them such as plastic containers bottles packaging and toys canned food and beverages fastprocessed foods nonstick cookware pesticides and cosmetics and consuming fresh and organic foods whenever possible However EDCs are ubiquitous in consumer products and the environment and there are many sources of exposure that are beyond the control of individuals Therefore policy changes are sorely needed such as banning the use of EDCs in consumer products and requiring companies to disclose what chemicals are in a product This would let consumers make informed choices for their health MedicalResearchcom What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work Response NAFLD is now diagnosed in children as young as 2 years of age and NAFLD in childhood is associated with increased risk for severe chronic liver disease later in adulthood We need more research and longitudinal studies to elucidate the potential effects of early life EDC exposures on pediatric NAFLD and its progression to more severe liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH liver cirrhosis and liver cancer We also need further research to understand how environmental chemical exposures may interact with our genes diet and social factors in the development of pediatric liver disease This information will be informative in designing more effective early life prevention and intervention strategies to reverse the current NAFLD epidemic in children and subsequently adults in the future MedicalResearchcom Is there anything else you would like to add Response We are deeply grateful to all researchers and research staff of the HELIX consortium and all the participating families in the HELIX cohorts This study was funded by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS and the European Communitys Seventh Framework Programme Citation Midya V Colicino E Conti DV et

What Is Hyperstension And Its Causes What is high blood pressure Hypertension is a common condition that affects the arteries of the body Also called high blood pressure With high blood pressure the force of the blood pushing against the walls of the arteries is always too strong The heart has to work harder to pump blood Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury mmHg Hypertension is generally defined as blood pressure above 80mmHg The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association divide blood pressure into four general categories Ideal blood pressure is classified as normal Normal blood pressure Blood pressure below 80mmHg Increased blood pressure Upper number ranges from to mm Hg and lower number is less than or equal to 80 mm Hg Hypertension Stage 1 Upper number ranges from to mm Hg or lower number mm Hg Hypertension Stage 2 The upper value is mmHg or more or the lower value is 90mmHg or more Blood pressure above mmHg is considered a hypertensive emergency or crisis Anyone with these blood pressure readings should seek emergency medical help Untreated high blood pressure increases your risk of heart attack stroke and other serious health problems It is important to have your blood pressure measured at least every 2 years from the age of 18 Some people need more frequent tests Healthy lifestyle habits such as quitting smoking exercising and eating a healthy diet can help prevent and treat high blood pressure Some people need drugs to treat high blood pressure Symptoms Most people with hypertension have no symptoms even when blood pressure levels reach dangerously high levels For years people can suffer from high blood pressure without symptoms People with high blood pressure may have the following symptoms Headache Shortness of breath Nosebleed However these symptoms are not specific It usually does not appear until high blood pressure reaches a serious or lifethreatening stage When to See a Doctor Blood pressure screening is an important part of general health care How often you need to check your blood pressure depends on your age and general health After age 18 have your blood pressure checked by your doctor at least every two years If youre over 40 or and at high risk for high blood pressure ask to have your blood pressure checked annually If you have high blood pressure or other heart disease risk factors your healthcare provider may recommend more frequent testing Children over the age of 3 can have their blood pressure measured at an annual physical examination If you dont see your healthcare provider regularly you may be able to get a free blood pressure test at a health fair or elsewhere in your community Free blood pressure monitors are also available at some stores and pharmacies The accuracy of these machines depends on several factors such as B Proper cuff size and proper use of machines Talk to your doctor about using a public blood pressure monitor Cause of blood pressure Blood pressure is determined by two factors the amount of blood pumped by the heart and the difficulty of moving blood through the arteries The more blood the heart pumps and the narrower the arteries the higher the blood pressure There are two main types of hypertension 1 Primary Hypertension also known as Essential Hypertension For most adults high blood pressure has no identifiable cause This type of hypertension is called primary or essential hypertension It tends to develop gradually over years Deposits in arteries called atherosclerosis increase the risk of high blood pressure 2 Secondary Hypertension This type of hypertension is caused by an underlying medical condition It usually begins suddenly and causes higher blood pressure than primary hypertension A physical examination alone can raise blood pressure This is called white coat hypertension The risk of high blood pressure increases with age By the age of 64 men are more likely to have high blood pressure A woman is more likely to have high blood pressure when she is over 65 Hypertension is particularly common among blacks It occurs at an earlier age in blacks than in whites Causes Family history If you have a parent or sibling with high blood pressure you are more likely to have high blood pressure Obesity or overweight Being overweight causes changes in your blood vessels kidneys and other parts of your body These changes often raise blood pressure Being overweight or obese also increases the risk of heart disease and its risk factors such as B High cholesterol Lack of exercise Not exercising can lead to weight gain Being overweight increases your risk of high blood pressure Inactive people also tend to have higher heart rates Tobacco use or vaping Smoking chewing tobacco

Yeah quiet quitting is great and all but have you tried chaotic working Like I remember back in my grocery store cashier days bshmatthews forfuckssakejim Yeah quiet quitting is great and all but have you tried chaotic working Like I remember back in my grocery store cashier days I did so much crazy shit When WIC Women infants and children voucher program to help low income mothersfamilies with children people were in my line I would pretty much know who they were Before the cards they had to tell us upfront they were WIC and show us their vouchers for what they were allowed to get it was awful some times Like 2 gallons of milk 4 worth of vegetables etc etc Theyd always have items hanging back waiting to see what the total was and if they would have to take it off the belt I began to place the fruitsvegetables a certain way on the register scale so that like 12lbs of grapes read as like 28lbs or something Then act shocked when I said that they still had X amount of lbs left They got all their fruit and vegetables I think it started to kinda Catch on to the women Because I would have the same moms in my line month after month And even after they switched to the cards they worked like food stamp cards Id still do the same thing They were able to get more produce for whatever shitty max amount Indiana gave them Anyways Be chaotic Its more fun that way ALT,0,0.901,0
fatphobia robs the world of all joy and I think the faster people accept that the faster we can like Improve and progress as a lunamistrunner lunamistrunner fatphobia robs the world of all joy and I think the faster people accept that the faster we can like Improve and progress as a society Im saying this extremely seriously We have got to get past this Fucking sick of it People lose their lives and years to this Whole generations were ruined by these ideas and expectations people are being so fucking weird about this post I swear to fuck Im literally talking about how being overly conscious about weight to the point of knowing no joy and being too self conscious and afraid to eat fucking cookies Like shut the god damn hell up fatphobia needs to be discussed as something that destroys peoples ability to enjoy things with other people Eating and food are things that bring people together as a community and as friends Im talking about this explicitly fatphobia is extremely bad and it was invented because someone somewhere wanted to sell you your own alienation so they could make more money on you being dissatisfied with something you have actually extremely little control over Fatphobia is bad Being discriminatory because of a natural body process is bad Thats it Thats the point of this post,1,-0.8639,0
So this week I ordered a new couch pillow because I had a husband pillow full of shredded memory foam and the thing needs to missalyssaread sweaterkittensahoy So this week I ordered a new couch pillow because I had a husband pillow full of shredded memory foam and the thing needs to be opened and shifted around about once a week with the way I use it so it doesnt shape up weird and actually fuck up my back when I bought it to NOT fuck up my back I now have a wedge pillow made of one piece of foam And I ordered a book cushion from etsy and I just wanna say to anyone who has thought that adaptive thing seems like it would be useful but Im not disabled so maybe its not for me Its for you Trust me My back hurt because I was slouching weird on the couch I got a husband pillow It helped a lot But it turns out what I need is one giant piece of memory foam not a bunch of tiny bits And the book cushion Books are heavy sometimes Being able to rest it higher in my lap so its easier to read and hold Better for my body Also do you wake up with pain in the mornings Try a contour pillow and a knee pillow Get those extrastrong treaded soles to wear with your heels because you wobble otherwise Wear compression gloves when you type Get those orthopedic shoes because you can walk longer distances in more comfort Buy the bra that actually supports the weight of your boobs Get a lapdesk for your computer Use a neck pillow even at home to keep your neck straight Wear socks to bed Listen to audiobooks Read large print books You see something that you think will work for you and improve how you feel Use it Lets fucking normalize adaptative shit for everyone Also dont think Oh but Im taking this from a disabled person The more people who use assistive devices and show demand for assistive devices THE MORE THEY MAKE AND THE BETTER THEY GET The best example of this I can think of is canes When I started using a cane 10 years ago they were either one color or old lady patterns There were all of two grip designs and they honestly kinda sucked Now as more and more people have realized they need them and have gotten them earlier in their lives for a variety of problems canes are SO DOPE NOW You can get them in Galaxy print Neon colors Different ergonomic grips You can even get what I have which is angleadjustable arm crutches Overcome your internal ableism and let yourself use the thing that prevents pain or makes your life easier This disabled person can tell you its worth it,0,0.9671,0

What Its Like To Be On The Internet In Sean Curry seancurry1 The problem with the previous 10 years of the internet an era defined by algorithmic social media feeds and endless growth isnt that the platforms have all my friends and their updates locked up in their walled gardens although thats certainly part of it Nor is the problem that theyre all trying to make money although thats definitely part of it The problem isnt even the Nazis white nationalists Chris Rufos TERFs and all other manners of asshole that barge into spaces created and populated by wellmeaning people shit on the floor and yell at everyone who asks them to clean it up and not do it again The problem is that the people in charge of those spaces wont stop them from coming back What do you do when a party host wont kick out the wild drunk thats ruining the party You find a new party What do you do when the wild drunk shows up again and your new host also wont kick them out What do you do when this happens again and again and again What do you do when every single party youve been going to for the last decade keeps having the same wild drunk show up and shit on the floor I wrote about how the internet has changed and how its changing again over on my blog Check it out What Its Like To Be On The Internet In Sean Curry So hey you know how I said if we keep relying on platforms to build our audiences well only end up having to rebuild on a new platform every years Substack Is Setting Writers Up For A TwitterStyle Implosion But when Substack tanks and I think its rightwing Muskflavored techbrobrained management indicates that it will it wont just mean losing the audience for our character latenight gummy jokes and covfefe memes It wont just mean losing a huge community of colleagues and readers It will mean losing a substantial portion of the audience for content that takes a hell of a lot more effort to produce the thoughtful rants the reported deepdives the serial fiction the smart criticism And without access to follower lists and emails there will be no way to find them again Writers will once again have to rebuild from nearscratch elsewhere Its happening again Its happening again just as it will always happen when we build our audiences on platforms owned by people that are beholden to shareholders and investors We have to build and manage our own platforms These social platformsTumblr includedcan be used to drive people to those platforms but if we rely on these companies to maintain and manage our platforms for us we are inevitably going to have to rebuild elsewhere,0,0.5824,0

Something that literally changed my life was working with a friend on a coding thing He was helping me create an auto rig foldingfittedsheets Something that literally changed my life was working with a friend on a coding thing He was helping me create an auto rig script and was trying to explain something to me but his words were just turning into static in my brain I was tired and confused and there was so many new concepts happening I could feel myself working toward a crying meltdown and was getting preemptively ashamed of what was about to happen when he said Hey are you someone who benefits from breaks It broke me Did I benefit from breaks I didnt know Id never taken them When a problem frustrated or upset me I just gritted my teeth and plowed through the emotional distress because eventually if you batter and flail at something long enough you figure it out So what if you get bruised on the way I viscerally remembered in that moment being forced to sit at the table late into the night with my dad screaming at me trying to understand math I remembered taking that with me into adulthood and having breakdowns every week trying to understand coding I could have taken a break Would it help I didnt know Id never taken one Yes I told him We paused our call I ate lunch I focused on other stuff for half an hour I came back in a significantly better state of mind and the thing hed been trying to explain had been gently cooking in the back of my head and seemed easier to understand Now when I find myself gritting my teeth at problems I can hear his gentle voice asking if I benefit from breaks Yes dear god yes why did I never get taught breaks Why was the only way I knew to keep suffering until something worked I was relating to this same friend recently my roadtrip to the redwoods with my wife We stopped every hour or so to get out and stretch our legs and switch drivers It was really nice When I was a kid wed just drive twelve hours straight and not stop for anything just gas Wed eat in the car and power through He gave a wry smile immediately connecting the mindset of my parents on a road trip to what theyd instilled in me about brute forcing through discomfort Do you benefit from breaks he echoed drawing my attention to it making me smile with the same sad acknowledgement Take breaks Youre allowed You dont have to slam into problems over and over and over let yourself rest It will get easier Take Breaks whewwwww,0,0.9261,0

US uses loophole to keep arms sales to Israel under the radar amid Gaza war theivorybilledwoodpecker US uses loophole to keep arms sales to Israel under the radar amid Gaza war The Washington Post reported that administration officials informed Congress of the foreign military sales to Israel in a classified briefing Few details are known of the sales because keeping each one small meant their contents remained secret but they are reported to have included precisionguided munitions small diameter bombs bunker busters small arms and other lethal aid The Arms Export Control Act makes significant exceptions for arms sales to close allies a limit of 25m for major defense equipment defined as bigticket items that require a lot of research and development but the limit rises to m for other defense articles like bombs This doesnt just seem like an attempt to avoid technical compliance with US arms export law its an extremely troubling way to avoid transparency and accountability on a highprofile issue Ari Tolany director of the security assistance monitor at the Centre for International Policy thinktank said She added that in exploiting the loophole the Biden administration was following the steps of its predecessor Theyre very much borrowing from the Trump playbook to dodge congressional oversight Tolany said The state department office of the inspector general found that between and the Trump administration had made 4 belowthreshold arms transfers to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates worth an estimated total of 112bn,1,-0.6873,0

Heres my metaphor for systemhood that I tell my singlet friends Imagine youre playing a first person video game You have thattheaterkid Heres my metaphor for systemhood that I tell my singlet friends Imagine youre playing a first person video game You have the controller you control your character Its a normal first person game You are an alter the character is the body This is fronting Other people live with you Sometimes they come into the room and sit and watch while you play They sometimes try to guide you give you advice on what to do next They dont always agree and they can argue with each other Other times they scream at you that youre doing everything wrong and you suck at this game This is coconsciousness Imagine how distracting it would be for people around you to tell you what to do or to scream at each other or at you even if they have good intentions It wouldnt be easy to focus on your game would it Then sometimes something happens in the game that prompts you to hand off the controller to someone else so they can play and you get a break This is some types of switching This can be good Other times someone rips the controller out of your hand or fights you for it This is other types of switching And sometimes six other players hook up their controllers but theres only one character to play as So all of you have your controllers but youre all trying to play the same character This is cofronting Imagine how difficult that would be Imagine how hard it would be to try and play a game while someone is trying to take the controller from you or while six other people are trying to play too There are also times that nobody is playing or you cant decide who should play Whats happening to the character in the game What are they doing if no one is playing This is dissociation The character is doing nothing Theyre stuck This is the best metaphor I have come up with for being a system Its something a lot of people get because theyve played games before,0,0.9768,0

Understanding Protein Quality Understanding Protein Quality Understanding protein quality is crucial for maintaining overall health and supporting specific nutritional goals Complete proteins are particularly valuable because they provide all essential amino acids necessary for various bodily functions including muscle repair and growth Animal sources like milk eggs and meat typically offer complete proteins while many plantbased sources may require combining complementary proteins to ensure all essential amino acids are present The Importance of Adequate Protein Intake When it comes to weight loss preserving muscle mass is crucial for maintaining metabolic health and achieving longterm results A sufficient protein intake particularly from highquality sources like whey protein and casein can help promote satiety and preserve muscle mass during calorie restriction Benefits for Older Adults As we age our muscle mass and strength naturally decline However a highquality protein intake can help mitigate this decline and support overall health and independence in later years For older adults sufficient protein intake is essential for maintaining muscle mass bone density and overall wellbeing Athletes and increased protein Athletes have increased protein needs due to the demands of training and exercise Quality protein sources are vital for muscle repair and recovery optimising performance and achieving training goals effectively Plantbased diets For those following a plantbased diet understanding how to combine different protein sources to ensure adequate amino acid intake is key Complementary proteins like those found in combinations such as rice and beans or hummus and pita can provide complete protein profiles when consumed together Variety and balance Its easy to get caught up in the importance of highquality protein sources but its equally important to remember that all protein sources regardless of quality contribute to our overall protein needs Variety and balance in our diet are key to ensuring were meeting our daily requirements and supporting how the body functions Source nutritionnews For more inspirational lifestyle blogs please check out my site,0,0.9892,0

Subconscious CheckIn Subconscious CheckIn Ive been tapping into my subconscious for years Its how Ive come to know about and come to terms with my experiences The subconscious helps you to change the way you think it can also promote personal growth and spirituality This blog goes into detail Your intuition works with your subconscious Once youve got the hang of tapping into and working with your intuition and you become more aware of your inner voice or little whisper you can start asking your subconscious questions questions like what is my subconscious mind trying to tell me What is it trying to communicate More possible questions to ask your subconscious might be What is my greatest fear or anxiety What is my deepest desire or passion What am I holding onto that is no longer serving me What am I avoiding or procrastinating about The subconscious can help you to become aware through different signals such as A feeling in your body such as a tingling a light or a heavy feeling An image An emotion A thought An image A gesture An impulse to do something Involuntary muscle movement My subconscious helps me to become aware through an emotion a heavy feeling an inner thought a feeling that produces an intention an impulse to act on what my emotions are presenting me with Intuition often referred to as gut feeling or sixth sense plays a significant role in shaping our decisions and actions Intuition is a powerful force Intuition is a powerful force as it allows us to make decisions and take actions that may not be immediately rational or logical but based on a deep sense of knowing Its as if our intuition is whispering guiding us towards a particular path or decision We may not even realise the extent to which our intuition is influencing our decisions until we reflect on our experiences and realise just how often weve followed our gut instincts The subconscious minds crucial role The subconscious mind plays a crucial role in helping us become aware of certain emotions thoughts and feelings that can influence our intentions and impulses Its not just a random or fleeting idea but rather a culmination of years of subconscious pattern recognition This means that your intuition is often built on a foundation of past experiences memories and learned behaviours that have been processed and stored in our subconscious mind The subconscious reflects how you feel about your relationships and your experiences around those relationships the good and bad Those experiences are not something you should ignore Recognising the power of our intuition By recognising the power of our intuition we can tap into this silent yet potent force that guides our actions in everyday life This can help us make more informed decisions navigate uncertain situations and respond to challenges with greater confidence and clarity Intuition a silent force The phrase silent force highlights the idea that our intuition may not always be loud or overt but its impact can be profound We may not even realise the extent to which our intuition is influencing our decisions until we reflect on our experiences and realise just how often weve followed our gut instincts You should trust your intuition This statement encourages us to trust our intuition more to listen to our inner voice the voice that guides us By acknowledging the power of our intuition we can learn to tap into it more effectively and make more informed decisions that align with our values and goals I am reminded of the importance of tuning into my own intuition and trusting my inner wisdom It is a valuable reminder that we all have this capacity within us waiting to be accessed The Pendulum The pendulum technique is a technique I use It is a technique that has been used for centuries to tap into the subconscious mind and gain insight into various aspects of your life Heres a breakdown of how it works The Pendulum BioFeedback Mechanism The pendulum is a simple yet powerful tool that allows us to access our subconscious mind The idea is that our subconscious mind is constantly sending out subtle signals which are then picked up by our body These signals are too small to be consciously detected but they can be amplified and translated into a physical response How the Pendulum Works As you hold the pendulum your subconscious mind sends out tiny involuntary muscle movements to your hand These micromovements are so small that theyre imperceptible to our conscious mind However these subtle movements can cause the pendulum to swing or move in response to the subconscious signal The pendulum No external force is required Contrary to what you think or understand about the pendulum no external force is required to move the pendulum The movement is entirely due to the subtle interactions between your subconscious mind and the physical body No Voodoo or Magic It is important to emphasise there is no magic or voodoo involved in using the pendulum To recap the pendulum is simply a tool that amplifies and translates the subconscious signals into a physical response Practical applications The pendulum can be used for various purposes such as Gaining insight into a situation or problem Answering questions or seeking guidance Identifying patterns or connections Detecting energies or vibrations Facilitating meditation and introspection Tips and Precautions Start with simple questions and gradually move on to more complex ones You will need to keep your mind open and focused Try to avoid influencing the pendulum with your conscious thoughts Use a neutral or calm environment to minimise external distractions Practice regularly to develop your skills and intuition By understanding the biofeedback mechanism behind pendulum dowsing you can unlock its potential and use it as a powerful tool for personal growth selfdiscovery and gaining insight into various aspects of life Intuition is often referred to as the automatic or unconscious mind and it is estimated to process up to 90 of our thoughts and behaviours Here are a few ways it can impact our lives Pattern recognition Our subconscious mind is wired to recognise patterns and make connections between seemingly unrelated events This can lead to habitual thinking emotional responses or decisionmaking patterns that may not be in our best interests Emotional regulation The subconscious mind is responsible for regulating our emotions including fear anxiety and stress These emotions can and often do influence our behaviour and decisionmaking without us even realising Memory consolidation The subconscious mind is also responsible for consolidating memories and learning from past experiences This can influence our behaviours attitudes and decisions without us consciously realising Automatic responses The subconscious mind is responsible for automatic responses to certain stimuli such as fear responses or kneejerk reactions These automatic responses can be triggered by subtle cues or stimuli without us even realising it The subconscious mind is the reason family feud the reason politicians fall out the reason wars are started The subconscious mind is the part of the brain that stores painful memories experiences The part of the brain we fail to access but the part of the brain that controls our presenting behaviour Its just about responsible for everything So how can you check in with your subconscious mind and gain more control over your thoughts behaviours and decisions Here are a few strategies Mindfulness Mindfulness can help increase awareness of your thoughts and emotions allowing you to better understand your subconscious mind Selfreflection Regular selfreflection can help you identify patterns and habits in your behaviour and decisionmaking processes Journalling Writing down journalling your thoughts and feelings can help you process your subconscious mind and gain insight into your past experiences your motives and what you would like Seeking professional help If youre struggling with negative patterns or behaviours that seem to be driven by your subconscious mind seeking help from a therapist or counsellor can be helpful By checking in with our subconscious mind and gaining greater awareness of its role in shaping our lives we can take control of our thoughts behaviours and decisions leading to greater selfawareness personal growth better decisionmaking and overall health and wellbeing Source happyrubincom Conclusion It is important to remember that your subconscious works in the background processing information and influencing your conscious thoughts and behaviours By tuning in and listening to your inner voice its whispers you can gain insight into your experiences including the good and the bad Its a way of dealing with and moving on from your past Receiving messages from your subconscious is also a powerful way to tap into your inner wisdom creativity and intuition The key is to practice working with your intuition Have you checked in with yours For more inspirational lifestyle blogs please check out my site,0,0.9993,0

Reading Benefits Books vs Digital Reading Benefits Books vs Digital Books in a digital world The debate over reading digital content versus traditional print books encompasses various dimensions including the physical experience cognitive effects environmental impact and accessibility There are many advantages to reading physical books that make them a preferable choice over digital Preference for Print Despite the rise of digital technology and ereaders digital many people still prefer print books This could be due to the tangible nature of physical books which provides a sense of ownership and connection that digital formats lack Additionally print books do not cause the eye strain associated with prolonged screen time Enhanced Comprehension and Recall Studies have shown that readers tend to absorb and recall content more effectively when reading physical books This increased comprehension is attributed to the tactile and sensory engagement that comes with being able to handle a physical book Tactile experience Physical books offer a sensory experience that ebooks cant repeat You can hold the book in your hands feel the weight of the pages and enjoy the tactile sensation of turning the pages No blue light Physical books dont emit blue light which can interfere with sleep and eye health Reading ebooks before bed can disrupt sleep patterns while physical books wont Better retention Studies have shown that readers who use physical books retain more information and have better comprehension than those who read ebooks No distractions Reading physical books are free from distractions like notification emails and social media allowing you to focus on your reading No dependence on technology You dont need a device or battery to read a physical book making them a great option for travel or areas with limited access to technology Sense of accomplishment Finishing a physical book can give you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction thats harder to achieve with ebooks Additionally comprehension is significantly better with physical books compared to ereaders suggests several advantages associated with traditional print Reading physical books are good for your health mental health If youre interested and fancy grabbing copies of any of my books please go to the following link For more inspirational lifestyle blogs please check out my site,0,0.9911,0

Healing Through Words Healing Through Words I dont know when it hit or when I became aware that my experiences were trauma based and I needed to heal It was making a physical change doing something positive and for the first time While I am aware writing about personal experiences is a powerful tool for understanding and processing emotions trauma can still be difficult to get past While writing can help us to understand some of our experiences it may not fully replace or mend the impact of a traumatic childhood The reason being experiences and traumas of childhood often have deeprooted effects that shape an individuals psyche and therefore their overall outlook on life Here are some key points Processing and Understanding Emotions Writing helps individuals make sense of their feelings and experiences It provides a structured way to explore and articulate their emotions that might otherwise remain suppressed or unexamined This process leads to greater selfawareness and emotional clarity Therapeutic Benefits Engaging in writing about personal experiences has therapeutic benefits If you continually choose to write it can serve as a form of release and selfexpression helping to alleviate feelings of anger pain or even sadness Many people may find comfort in putting their thoughts into words being able to read and see their experiences from a different perspective Validation and Empowerment Sharing personal stories can validate ones experiences and feelings It can be empowering as it allows individuals to reclaim their narrative and assert control over their lives This can be a crucial step in the healing process Connection and Support Writing about difficult experiences can foster connection with others who have had similar experiences Over my years of writing it is what I have found It can create a sense of community and support which is important for healing Knowing that others have faced similar challenges can be comforting and also motivating The Writing Process I find writing therapeutic as I continue through my words to bring explanations to explore my childhood trauma Writing may not always answer the why questions On the why questions it may take years to work those out Instead you hope you can find resolution through talking things out The truth is many of us will face traumatic experiences at some point in our lives It can be the result of chronic stress abuse or neglect Trauma can also be a cumulative effect of multiple experiences therapists can help to incorporate specialised techniques on the more difficult issues its hard to get past LongTerm Healing Healing from traumatic childhood issues including stress neglect or abuse is a longterm process It often requires developing physical coping strategies and making lifestyle changes to support mental and emotional wellbeing A final thought It is important to note and acknowledge that finding resolution may not always be possible especially if the individuals who cause harm are unwilling to take responsibility or apologise In such cases healing may involve finding ways to cope with the ongoing emotional impact of the trauma or harm rather than seeking resolution with the people who caused it its essential to acknowledge that the focus may shift from resolution to healing and coping Forgiveness is a personal choice that can be difficult to achieve and its not always necessary for healing For more inspirational lifestyle blogs please check out my site,1,-0.7964,0

Helicopter Parenting Coping Strategies Helicopter Parenting Coping Strategies If you have been affected by helicopter parents this blog should help The issues of being a child of helicopter parents means there will be many challenges that follow you into adulthood Its not uncommon for children to feel anxious when their parents are overlyprotective controlling domineering involving themselves in your everyday The following tips should help Tell your parents how you feel Communication is important Openly talk to your parents about how you feel Be specific about what youre comfortable with Try to help your parents understand that you appreciate their concern their help but its important for you to make your own decisions for you to have your space and independence Set boundaries Boundaries are important in any relationship Establish clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship This might mean setting aside specific times for your parents or to limit their involvement in certain aspects of your life Practice assertive communication When expressing your needs or concerns use I statements instead of you statements For example I feel overwhelmed when you call me every hour Could we schedule a specific time to talk each day instead of Youre always calling me and its annoying Develop problemsolving skills Encourage your parents to ask you questions and help you find solutions to problems This will empower you to take ownership of your decisions and develop critical thinking skills Develop coping mechanisms Learn healthy coping mechanisms such as deep breathing exercise or journalling to manage stress and anxiety caused by your parents overinvolvement Focus on selfcare Engage in activities that you enjoy or spend time with friends This can help you develop a sense of identity and purpose outside of your relationship with your parents Parents behaviour Often parents behaviour is as a result of their own upbringing their own fears insecurities and lack of understanding rather than a personal attack on you Seek professional help If youre struggling to cope with the stress and anxiety caused by helicopter parenting consider seeking help from a mental health professional They can provide you with personalised guidance and support Practice selfcompassion Be kind to yourself Remember that youre doing the best you can in a challenging situation Conclusion As parents at some point we will have done a little extra to make our childs life easier Its what parents do right But the problem with helicopter parenting is that when it comes a regular everyday occurrence it hinders healthy development It is essential for parents to strike a balance between providing support and guidance while also giving their children the space to grow and develop independently By setting boundaries and encouraging selfreliance parents can help their children develop into confident capable and selfassured individuals For more inspirational lifestyle blogs please check out my site,0,0.9966,0

tried to vent in a trans space about how as a trans man whos been on T for a long time over 7 years now i have noticed that whoreratio gynandrous spacelazarwolf swordbeliever tried to vent in a trans space about how as a trans man whos been on T for a long time over 7 years now i have noticed that the more i pass as a man the less welcomed i am in queer spaces unless i go out of my way to feminize myself and how that sucks and its isolating and it feels horrible to see ppl who used to like you and be close to you drift further and further the more masculine therefore more comfortable in urself u become only to get ppl replying to me and saying well if you dressed more fem then ppl wouldnt be intimidated by you you signed up for this im sorry but i didnt sign up for social isolation when i transitioned i signed up for gender euphoria and comfort in myself and my life and i had hoped that the ppl in my life would be able to see how much joy that brings me and continue to love me i need ppl to realize that telling trans ppl to change the way they present to make other ppl comfortable with their gender is fucking transphobic its transphobic when its telling a trans woman to dress more femme or feminize her voice so she doesnt intimidate people its transphobic when its telling a trans man the same it is explicitly and inexcusably transphobic and it is literally never okay trans people belong in queer spaces period there is no dress code we belong there bc we built those fucking spaces would also like to add that as a fat balding very passing bear of a trans man who DOES dress and present very femme the whole if you were more femme people wouldnt be uncomfortable thing doesnt even fucking work for me because i pass as the Wrong Kind of feminine man im not a skinny little 20 yr old twink so its gross and offputting when i crossdress but if i go full masc im even more offputting and even if i out myself i still get Looks or am treated coldly lmfao youre only allowed to be a cute little genderbending boyprincess if youre palatable thin and pale and hairless and harmless ive said it before but the root of this problem and the problem OP faces is that queer people need to get the fuck over their fear of people who look like they might have a penis because it is isolating to trans men and fucking deadly to trans women its all gender is fake you can do whatever you want forever until you set off too many Penis Haver alarms and suddenly youre treated like a loaded gun anyway butch tgirls and tboy fembears i love you also a lot of trans women look like Problematic Cishet Man the kind where people will make jokes about you looking like a school shooter until and usually also well into transition and then youre not wanted in queer spaces because you cant even articulate why you belong there and everybody just assumes youre dangerous men being treated as automatically predatory threatening is a miserable and isolating thing for trans women and trans men alike and it affects cis men too driving people into isolation like that only makes them more likely to actually become a threat,0,0.9528,0
Uniquely Australian Line Orient Line Uniquely Australian Line Orient Line I recently had the honour of spending some time with my coauthor Australian maritime historian Rob Henderson As two Australian maritime authors we both have a strong appreciation for the Orient Line Orient Line was once one of the most recognised names operating on the route between Great Britain and Australia forming an important connection between the many peoples of the Empire The great vessels of Orient Line included Oronsay Orsova Oriana Despite being formed with no Australian mail subsidy and a dominant competitor in PO the Orient Line survived its early formation and thrived Above Chris and Rob on board Pacific Adventure in Orient Line survived two world wars the Great Depression and stormy seas carrying everything from mail to royalty troops to tourists The stories of Orient Lines contribution to the Australian war effort are remarkable A few years ago Rob Doug Rachelle and I wrote a book about this unique line It traced the early days of the Orient Line of Clipper Ships through the era of steam driven liners to the final Orient Line voyage It showcases the history of Orient Line with an exquisite collection of rare photographs,0,0.8109,0

Verify by bilalsalah0 Our lives before the genocide were not perfect to say the least but we were happy and hopeful Our dreams were and are still bigger than the walls barbed wire and tanks surrounding us but today we find ourselves in a situation where hope keeps being dimmed by constant humiliation and unprecedented injustice The adults in my family are barely holding on Theyre doing their best but what is our childrens fault What did they do to deserve such unbearable suffering at a very young age When will this nightmare end Will I be able to see them all someday safe sound happy and thriving like all children should Such cruel neverending questions keep haunting me night and day What we seek above all is not only to live in safety but also with dignity which is a basic human right we have always been denied whenever I see Omar and Salahs pictures in our beautiful home that was leveled to the ground I cant help but compare them to the state theyre in now struggling to survive in a flimsy airless makeshift tent surrounded by rubble all sorts of diseasecarrying insects the stench of sewage floods and garbage and the smell of death everywhere only made worse by the sweltering summer heat The newborns and the childrens innocent faces amidst such misery wont leave my thoughts They fill me with grief and rage because of how helpless I am Seeing the kids smile and hold their heads up high despite all the suffering and fear their little hearts have to go through every single day is pure torture Their childhood games have been replaced by waiting in long lines for food and water and carrying containers sometimes heavier than their fargile malnourished bodies Most of their playgrounds kindergartens and schools have been reduced to dust and rubble and the ones left are still being bombed allowing them no respite or refuge from the horrors of the war For almost ten months now our little angels have been enduring hardships beyond their years ripped from the safety and warmth of their home and everything they knew and loved and forced into a life of pain and peril where only the unknown awaits them Your support is our only ray of hope amidst such a dire and bleak situation My family and especially our children need you now more than ever as the airstrikes starvation and water and health crises are only intensifying and we are being further humiliated and annihilated I never wanted it to come to this I used to think I could handle everything myself but I truly have no choice but to ask for help now Please help me protect my family and bring them closer to the life of safety and dignity they deserve as all humans do wherever they are Verify by shabhussein The fundraiser has been vetted here Line My campai ng Nearly 80 Funded Please continue to donate and share to save my familys life Even if its just 1 or just one reblog all of these small actions add up to make a huge difference in my familys life Donate to Help Evacuate My Family from Gaza to Safety organized by Bilal salah,0,0.9105,0

Im a strong proponent of lying to get the help you need I always try the truthful route first but if that gets me nowhere thehmn Im a strong proponent of lying to get the help you need I always try the truthful route first but if that gets me nowhere Lying it is I think its important to respect other peoples time wellbeing and money so I dont do it in situations where I know Im in the wrong like if I want to get into a place just for fun and someone could get in trouble for letting me in wrongfully Id rather not But sometimes people just dont understand why something is important in your situation so you have to turn it into something they understand When I lived in England I constantly lied about being pregnant so gas station employees would let me use their bathroom because for some reason they didnt have public bathrooms Or when my doctors secretary couldnt get it into her head that my stomach pains were very serious and concerning and insisted I couldnt get an appointment this month so that evening I found a lump that I was pretty sure was nothing but it meant I had a reason to call her the next day and get a new appointment immediately and when the doctor told me the lump was harmless I could tell her what my real problem was and she immediately scheduled ALL the tests and examinations because she understood how concerning it was I just had to get past the fucking secretary with a lie Fuck I even support that elderly man who lied about having four children who were stuck in a house during a flood but when the rescue team got there in a dinghy they realized it was four dogs The guy knew he had to lie because he was too sick to help them himself able bodied people in the area were able to save their own pets and they wouldnt have helped him if they knew it was just dogs In the video the rescue team can be seen choking up and padding him on the back while he cries with his scared dogs in his arms The team is clearly not mad because they can see how important the dogs are to him but I have no doubt he was right in thinking they wouldnt have helped if he had told them the truth So do what ya gotta do and lie lie lie,0,0.9792,0

Members Supporting Jimin and his phenomenal success of MUSE Members Supporting Jimin and his phenomenal success of MUSE I will equivocally state that I am a jikooker with Jimin as my bias but I support ALL members with my money buying albums digital downloads merch fan club concerts and time streaming blogs IG TikTok But i dont understand for the life of me the antics of one member This is Jimins promotional weekend and there has not been one ounce of support for Jimin and his album release from Taehyung Yet most of the other members Suga does not promote while enlisted have congratulated JM and shown their support I expect to see a tiktok post from JK soon as he did for Hobi and RM But why has Tae not supported this album release of Muse just like he never supported FACE What he does instead is release a promo for his photo book during Jimins promo period Actually i was ok with it because it was not music but a personal photo project I saw as a gift to Army on Army day But today in the middle of tracking and charting for Jimin along with the trailer for JMJK travel show releasing later today he decides to post a photo of him and JK in Hawaii stating JK will come quickly because he asked him to and missed him What was the point of this post Why is he feeding the taekookers who have been dragging Jimin relentlessly since the announcement of the travel show and the drop of his album A large group of people who are actively working against Jimin by supporting other acts just to try and hold back Jimin Mind you JK is not getting the hate I am not saying a member has to publish on social media to show support but he did for other members and never for Jimin That whole show where they hugged each other on Jins discharge was very touching but now feels so disingenuous Help me understand what is going on and why this seems to continually happen Last year JK would come back and provide context to everything that Tae said that put taekookers on a roll Like Jimin he has pretty much been absent from social medial and cant do lives Do I believe they are all friends Yes But are they all as close to each equally obviously not and that is understandable Tae is closer to his wooga squad than he is most of the members of BTS But even taking the whole shipping aspect away from jikook i would still feel Taes actions should be questioned simply because what he does over and over again is to rile up the toxic members of his fanbase and taekookers to hate on Jimin We saw how bad it got last year with the death threats and reports to the Ministry of Defense from JK solos and taekookers It is bad now with Jimins album release and travel show with JK What does it take to be supportive like the other members or just simply be quiet this weekend This is not a hate post towards Tae but a post calling out a behavior that has negative connotations towards Jimin his supposed soulmate Bottom Line STREAM STREAM STREAM FOR JIMIN LIKE THERE IS NO TOMORROW,0,0.9965,0

Why Costa Olympia became Norwegian Sky Why Costa Olympia became Norwegian Sky Norwegian Cruise Lines Norwegian Sky was ordered and partially built to be a Costa Cruises ship expected to be called Costa Olympia Costa Cruises was expanding its fleet in the s and the introduction of the Costa Victoria in brought in an array of new amenities for the brand Costa Victoria was built at Bremer Vulcan yard in Germany At 75gt the ship featured large public spaces multiple balcony cabins and a large on deck entertainment zone to their shipboard amenities The ship was the first in the Victoriaclass and was expected to have a sister ship named Costa Olympia Costa Olympia was laid down at the same German shipyard but while the ship was being built the shipyard went bankrupt This threw the building of Costa Olympia into disarray which was only 35 complete at the time What was built was launched in October to clear the slipway and Costa Olympias incomplete hull was immediately laid up for long term storage The ongoing shipyard issues led Costa to abandon their plans to take delivery of Costa Olympia Becoming Norwegian Sky The s saw Norwegian Cruise Line implement growth plans of their own NCL purchased Costa Olympias incomplete hull in and had it towed to the Lloyd Werft Yard in Bremerhaven Germany in early What had already been built was incorporated into a modified design with design works overseen by the same firm that had been working on Costa Olympia The ship was ultimately launched as Norwegian Sky Bigger than Costa Victoria the 78gt ship entered service for NCL in The design was considered to be successful enough to warrant NCL to order two additional ships in the class The second NCL vessel was launched as Norwegian Sun NCLs third order was ultimately cancelled With Costa Victoria now scrapped only Norwegian Sky and Norwegian Sun remain but continue as popular members of the NCL fleet,0,0.8625,0

Shannen Dohertys Untimely Death Sparks Important Conversations About Healthcare Access And Equity Shannen Dohertys Untimely Death Sparks Important Conversations About Healthcare Access And Equity Shannen Dohertys Untimely Death Sparks Important Conversations About Healthcare Access And Equity By Janice Gassam Asare Shannen Doherty the actress best known for her roles in Beverly Hills and Charmed has died after a long battle with cancer at the age of 53 In a statement to People magazine the actress revealed her breast cancer diagnosis stating that she was undergoing treatment and that she was suing a firm and its former business manager for causing her to lose her health insurance due to a failure to pay the insurance premiums According to reports in a lawsuit Doherty shared that she hired a firm for tax accounting and investment services among other things and that part of their role was to make her health insurance premium payments to the Screen Actors Guild Doherty claimed that their failure to make the premium payments in caused her health insurance to lapse until the reenrollment period in When Doherty went in for a checkup in March of the cancer was discovered at which time it had spread In the lawsuit Doherty indicated that if she had insurance she would have been able to get the checkup soonerthe cancer would have been discovered and she could have avoided chemotherapy and a mastectomy Under the IRS actors are often classified as independent contractors which comes with its own set of challenges Although it is unclear what Dohertys situation was for many independent contractors obtaining health insurance can be difficult Trying to get health insurance as an independent contractor can be a costly and convoluted process A Actors Equity Association survey indicated that more than 80 of nonunion actors and stage managers in California have been misclassified as independent contractors A research study revealed that selfemployment which is what independent contractors are considered to be was associated with a higher likelihood of being uninsured Dohertys tragic situation invites a larger conversation about healthcare access and equity in the United States According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities the Affordable Care Act ACA also known as Obamacare was signed into law in and revolutionized healthcare access in two distinct ways creating health insurance marketplaces with federal financial assistance that reduces premiums and deductibles and by allowing states to expand Medicaid to adults with household incomes up to percent of the federal poverty level The ACA helped reduce the number of uninsured Americans and expanded healthcare access to those most in need It also helped close gaps in coverage for different populations including those with preexisting health conditions lowerincome individuals parttime workers and those from historically excluded and marginalized populations Despite strides made through the ACA healthcare access and equity are still persistent issues especially within marginalized communities Research from the Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation KFF examining data indicated that in nonelderly American Indian and Alaska Natives AIAN and Hispanic people had the greatest uninsured rates 191 and 18 respectively When compared with their white counterparts Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders NHOPI and Black people also had higher uninsured rates at 127 and 10 respectively The Commonwealth Fund reported that between and states that expanded Medicaid eligibility had higher rates of insurance coverage and health care access with smaller disparities between racialethnic groups and larger improvements than states that didnt expand Medicaid Its important to note that if a Republican president is elected Project the farright policy proposal document seeks to upend Medicaid as we know it by introducing limits on the amount of time that a person can receive Medicaid When peeling back the layers to examine these racial and ethnic differences in more detail the Brookings Institute noted in that the refusal of several states to expand Medicaid could be one contributing factor One research study found that some underrepresented racial groups were more likely to experience insurance loss than their white counterparts The study indicated that for Black and Hispanic populations specific trigger events were more likely as well as socioeconomic characteristics that were linked to more insurance loss and slower insurance gain The study also noted that in the US health insurance access was associated with employment and and marriage and that Black and Hispanic populations were disadvantaged in both areas Equity in and access to healthcare is fundamental but bias is omnipresent Age bias for example is a pervasive issue in breast cancer treatment Research also indicates that racial bias is a prevalent issuebecause the current guidelines in breast cancer screenings are based on white populations this can lead to a delayed diagnosis for women from nonwhite communities Our health is one of our greatest assets and healthcare should be a basic human right no matter what state or country you live in As a society we must ensure that healthcare is available affordable and accessible to all citizens After all how can a country call itself great if so many of its citizens especially those most marginalized and vulnerable dont have access to healthcare,1,-0.967,0

Shannen Tribute by friends and costars from Lets Be Clear Shannen Tribute by friends and costars from Lets Be Clear I complied these from the nexttolast Lets Be Clear podcast episode The podcast launched last year by Shannen Doherty Holly Marie Combs I think Shannen would be really pleasantly surprised by the outbaring of love and emotion that has come from so many different people in places because she really did often feel like the underdog and vilified and that she had to prove herself in so many different ways I think shed be really surprised and shocked by how many people have reached out and said really beautiful things about her Its just a testament to who she was as a person Im angry and Im sad she doesnt get to see the places that she wanted to And Im angry and sad that once again Ive lost you know that person that you can call in the middle of the night to cancer Ive lost another friend to cancer And its really hard when you lose someone who should have and really wanted to live along in full life not just for herself but for other people in her family You know when I went through tough times in my life some really horrible stuff and one day I showed up on her door step and I didnt know how bad I looked physically until I saw it on her face and I saw her face change and I knew I must have been pretty beat up To her credit she never shied away she never took a step back and if something was wrong she went full end to help me fix it And I think thats because she had seen so much pain and trauma in her own life that she didnt want to see anybody else go through it And whether it was me or my kids She was literally always a phone call away Its so unbelievable that even knowing she was sick we just thought we had more time And she definitely did think she had more time So I guess for me thats the lesson is that you think you have time but you dont And not many people could do what Shannen did in one day She was just like a tornado of energy But I think thats the thing to take away from all of this is you think you have time and so you know she would give me an awful hard time that I dont say I love you enough To anyone Its not on a like you know personal oasis but to anyone in general And so I would say you know tell the people you love that you love and live like there is no tomorrow because thats what she did Brian Krause When I got on the show Charmed I was really nervous to show up and perform in front of her I knew the stakes were raised that you know I had heard rumors and blah blah blah And I got on I knew my lines I did my thing and she just looked over me and she kind of gave a little wink in a good job and you know to get her approval that I had formed well and done well It meant everything I was told I was going to be a regular on the show it was actually Shannen who had said to me because when you had powers on Charmed you usually were a bad guy and you died And she took me aside and she said no youre a good guy and youre going to stick around and you just keep doing what youre doing and youll be around for a while And it was her way of saying you know good job keep showing up and keep kicking ass and kind of joining me opening her wings and allowing me to be a part of her family And I was so honored by it that Charmed had this lets kick some ass and make really good entertainment and that was all Shannen setting the standard of what professionalism was And Ill never forget it And Ive been so lucky the last few years to have gotten to know her as weve done comic cons and this podcast and to know Shannen is a human and her enduring spirit of anything is possible And if I could say anything to Lets be clear fans Shannen really believed anything was possible with hard work determination and vision lets go get it And I dont think I ever should heard her say I dont know how or oh what if or it cant It wasnt a part of her DNA it was oh weve run into a wall Okay lets fix this lets get this done lets do this No lets take action And I think anything I could pass on that rubbed off on me that meant so much was our work ethic and desire to do what she wanted to do and live fearlessly And Im going to take that with me and try and do it every day every day every day I love Shannen so much and I wish I got a chance to tell her that shes an amazing amazing human being I just feel really lucky that I was able to be a part of Im forever grateful for her friendship Drew Fuller In honor of her Lets be very clear Shannen was a warrior She faced adversity head on with everything that she got and refused to be a victim She lived her life with so much passion with love and a fearlessness that I will strive daily to replicate Shes inspired hired millions of people Shes inspired me and I will love her forever and I hope each and every one of you listening will honor her spirit by living the way she lived Dorian Gregory I remember her with a smile and the laughter and the joy that we shared together and that way it will live forever I was impacted by that First thing on set I heard this amazing laughter I looked around the corner and it was Holly and Shannen sharing a moment having such genuine real laughter I walked over first days awkward she welcomed me warmly and that was and then a lot I come from a house of strong women to turn Accomplished and sharp as sharks sharp as sharkingby That was her My father passed from cancer and my mother passed with cancer So I have a little idea of what happens on the day to day I say this because I remember Shannen a year ago and her autographs on me Its the last time I actually was there physically around her and her wit and her warmth and her energy and her strength just as strong as ever and her generosity and care for her fans In every convention Ive been with her every time ive been in her presence A week ago we did a podcast and Shannen was sharing her years of experience in this distance and the ins and outs and the ups and downs and her artistic affectionism and that was so wonderful to hear James Eckhouse You were a ferocious spirit You were ferocious in your work your talent Youre ferocious in your love Youre ferocious in your courageous battle with cancer I really loved working with you both as actor and director Yeah you always brought all of your heart to every scene And when I brought my young kids to the set Im forever grateful to you for being so welcoming so kind They never forgot We honor you and we treasure you You will be sorely missed Mark Damon Espinoza Our storylines were always going in different directions and Im really sorry we didnt have more opportunities to actually work together on screen She was a terrific actress However when we did pass on the set at the studio wherever we were you know make up trailer or wardrobe or whatever She was always really really nice to me And at the time it would have been very easy for me to be intimidated You know I was working with some of if not the most famous young people on the planet at that time They didnt have to be nice Shannen was however And Ill always remember that Years after she was shooting something at the gym where I was working out and I was a mess I was just coming from a run and I was sweaty but she saw me from a good distance away and stopped production came over to me gave me this huge hug and wanted to know how I was doing And she didnt let me go until I told her I mean not everyone would hug a sweaty guy at the gym after theyve been in hair and makeup and and have a crew waiting But that thats Shannen and Ill keep in my heart you know Thats thats the one Ill remember for the rest of my my own life None of us are immortal and our time is far too short Hers was far far too short But her energy her her fight her spirit thatll live on Thatll live on Shenae Grimes I owe more to Shannen than Im sure she ever knew than most people know If it werent for Shannen I would not be who I am in so many more ways than one I had the good fortune of being cast on the spin off series of in playing the character Annie Wilson who was part of the brothers sister duo that moved from a small town to Beverly Hills And the only reason why that happened is because Shannen Doherty created one of the most iconic characters ever to be on television in my opinion and I think a lot of people would agree with me on that one Shannen Doherty created the character that we all fell in love with I had the incredible fortune of stepping into a tiny version of her shoes and hopefully follow into her footsteps in a way that made Shannen proud Because Shannen was so warm and so lovely and so fiercely strong and unapologetic and she is the type of woman that I have always aspired to be And it was watching her do it despite everything that she was met with and continue to forge ahead being true to who she was that gave me the confidence to do the same no matter how much resistance Ive been met with throughout my life Because of that and there Ive said it before theres really not been much of a blueprint for how to be a strong unapologeticly strong woman in a world and society that is so determined to tell you not to But she did it She did it and she as far as Im concerned is one of the very few that is the blueprint Its women like Shannen Doherty that give the rest of us permission and confidence to demand what we deserve stand up for ourselves and not take any shit And I hope Im allowed to say that but I think Shannen would be okay with it In my short time of getting the job on and starting to film and being a part of the tabloid fodder and media craze that was at that time it was only a little why into that process and that experience that I met Shannen and had the privilege to actually work with her portraying the character of Brenda alongside me on And at that point already in just a short window of time I had been so mentally broken down by the experience You know I was eighteen when I moved out to La to take on the job I was by myself left my family back home really didnt know anybody other than my cast And the behind the scenes drama that Beverly Hills was known for definitely was recreated behind the scenes of our spinoff of as well And I think Shannen and I am not having ever spoken about it but I think a lot of our experiences or the experiences I had mirrored a lot of the experiences that she had Meeting her that day in the trailer I was so exciting because she was my favorite character from the original show I had watched it with my mom growing up so I was a super fan of her already and I think you know brown hair like she was the gorgeous brunette for the show so I felt most like tied to her and I was so nervous meeting her and she literally just like welcomed me into her trailer with the biggest smile and the warmest hug and it was like I dont even know if she meant to communicate this with her hug but it made me feel so seen and like I was not alone in everything that I was experiencing at that time because it was a lot It was a lot for an eighteen nineteen year old girl to go through And getting that hug from her knowing that she experienced so much at times a million when she was my age like was everything to me because all I saw with this was this beautiful strong woman who was so resilient who had made it out of that experience still with her chin held high fire in her belly and being true to who she was and to me that was Shannen Doherty The queen of the Badasses that give us all permission and confidence to be who we are to demand respect and to never settle for anything less tan what we deserve David Lascher I always admired her for being such a strong woman She knew what exactly what her voice was She didnt pander to anybody My scenes werent with Shannen and she was a tough nut to crack to be honest she was guarded But then we became friends She had this soft side to her that I think a lot of people didnt know and she was a beautiful soul and to see such a strong person have to fight the fight that she went through was so heartbreaking and I really thought she was winning And Im just so sad and heartbroken and I love her soul and I hope shes at peace Randy Spelling Ever since I saw that smile on Little House on the Prairie it just lit up the screen And Shannen lit up the screen every screen that she was on She lit up a room every room that she was in She just had this energy about her and she was small and she was slight but she just had such a big presence and energy that you could feel tough at times soft and sweet at times Shannen you will be so missed You will always be my first legitimate crush And I know you were greeted by so many loved ones Thank you for being you and for being so committed to that which you believed in and showing that to the world No matter what it was you had this incredible commitment and tenacity and drive and passion to go after what it is that you believed in Dean Butler When we met Shannen for the first time at the beginning of season nine of Little House on the Prairie she made a very strong impression And that impression there were a couple of things One she was talented There was no doubt that Shannen had a gift And the other thing that you couldnt miss about Shannen is that Shannen was determined to make something of herself in the entertainment industry She had one of the most powerful motors in that area that Ive ever seen in all the years that Ive been around our industry Shannen left us way too soon but not unlike someone else that she and I both worked with on Little House Michael Landon who died at the age of fifty four from pancreatic cancer Shannen fit a lot of life into her fifty three years and she will be remembered for it Kevin Smith Shannen broke the Internet before the Internet even existed Shes an American icon When I went to work on Clerks when we went to Minnesota to shoot the movie it was almost as if you know the business Hollywood whatever you know Id arrived with my first movie but here I was about to take make my second movie first with the studio first with a real budget And the first person from the industry to meet me over this bridge that I crossed thanks to making Clerks the first person in the business of professional who was there to welcome me was Shannen And I always found that wonderful and bittersweet and ironic that I spent so many nights watching her on this little television grainy TV and then I saw her in all her glory in real life no grain whatsoever I had a crush on her then Ill always have a crush on her S he was a force of nature One month since your departure Forever missed Never gone never forgotten,0,0.9999,0

center View this post on Instagram A post shared by TransActual UK Yes thank you so much I was just reading their page about it here too I cant look at the twitter link but the following comments seem to think this isnt an accurate description of whats happening What about we dont take the government that is trying to take away our rights at their fucking word They say this shit so people like you say this and so we dont take it seriously enough to fight back THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE PROPER MEDICAL TRANSITION FUNCTIONALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND REPLACE IT WITH CONVERSION THERAPY Just like they did with children basically thats the alternative well eventually be offered And they will be calling it a better version of transgender care Do you get that I am begging you people to not believe what a plainly transphobic and hostile government tells you Open your eyes and actually see what theyre doing Take this fucking seriously If you dont believe me at least remember what I said after the Levy report comes out and things get much worse for trans adults in the months afterwards The twitter account in my original post has been locked for nonfollowers due to harassment atm I believe This is a thread of someone else in the same situation in reddit Theres been many more reports there of the same thing happening to other trans people The review is deffinately in our favour thats why the law was changed specifically to steal data that would otherwise be illegal to collect so that they can pretend the majority of transitions are unsuccesful because most of us dont have GRCs which they have intentionally kept hard to get even after repeated calls to fix the process I swear people have the memory of a goldfish when it comes to politics ALT View on Twitter This is being taken to the UN If your GP has refused to prescribe HRT following instruction from your GIC send in evidence Dr Tlaleng aims to present the case by December Send evidence to the UN directly HERE or to the above twitter user read this instead of arguing Thank you for answering my question when I asked Its good that you have all day to spend on twitter to make sure that important information isnt kept hidden since it would be absoutely ridiculous to shout at people that theyre ignorant when all the information about an important process is kept to only one persons tweets Im not sure if you missed the first time I asked for extra information but here it is incase you were skim reading No need to be passive agressive when I told you already AND THEN you tried to tell me I was wrong Also its on 2 persons tweets as well as being circulated elsewhere I have repeatedly tried to explain things to you which you have then dismissed dont go acting all reasonable just because its in reblogs instead of replies now I can post that what is in the replies if you think I dont have the right to be angry at someone treating me with disrespect Do you really think telling people I strongly suggest you actually read up on the changes that have been happening is explaining anything rather than saying fuck off to google Are you trying to say that evidence is easy to find if its on two peoples tweets and a couple of reblogs Also you keep trying to say that Im trying to discourage people from acting on whats happening Youve not even added the information about how to submit on the sites which you linked above or ways to contact the trans writes lady without having to use twitter I added those You can check in the reblogs You are being a cunt,1,-0.9851,0

Back when I was first leaving the mattress store in I interviewed at a few places One was Tesla the other a jewelry foldingfittedsheets Back when I was first leaving the mattress store in I interviewed at a few places One was Tesla the other a jewelry store I wasnt a fan of Musk but I liked the idea of electric cars and Ive always excelled at sales so I felt like it was worth considering I arrived and chatted with the sales manager who said everyone started on phones before they could work their way up I was a little wary of that as Im not a phone person but she laughed and said Well you know Were still just a startup so everyone has to put in the hours I stared at her in confusion Tesla A startup In What I laughed a little and suggested that it was past that stage of growth but she doubled down and repeated it later I remained baffled After the interview she offered to let me talk to an employee to see how happy she was I readily agreed The manager left I asked the employee how happy she was She said that sometimes pay was late that promotions were promised that didnt manifest for months but that overall she liked working there and cut them slack because they were still just a startup I stared at her It was like listening to a cultist repeating a phrase that was in direct contradiction with reality I wanted to ask what she thought a startup was but I just thanked her for her time I got offered both jobs Tesla or jewelry Jewelry offered four more dollars an hour When I turned down the Tesla lady I kindly said that I didnt feel there was as much job security in a startup,0,0.9952,0

everyone says join your local mutual aid groups and build community but uh what do you do if a lot of them seem to have riverlight82 fruityshirts luulapants theophages everyone says join your local mutual aid groups and build community but uh what do you do if a lot of them seem to have dissolved and the other ones dont have consistent recurring meetings this is real and its a thing that a lot of people are going to run into in the fact of calls to get involved especially if theyre people who havent been deeply involved in their communities before so heres what I can share You cant expect it to be built for you already Community organizing has fallen apart in a lot of places That means you may need to be the one to start it Someone has to Your presence will matter Local community networks are SMALL That means that every single person has an outsized presence and an outsized absence One person dropping off the map can feel catastrophic but that also means that one person stepping up can make all the difference Find a center Any community group needs a steady base That can be a physical location thats why coffeehouses were historically such effective grounds for building political and creative movements It can also be a person or people who are consistent and reliable If one person shows up to make space for work on a regular basis theyll be there when the second person shows up Theyll be there for the third Thats how it starts Play secretary A lot of activist groups are starving for some basic admin support Maybe youre not up for being the leader but maybe you can organize the Google drive Maybe you can be the one that keeps phone numbers Theres a lot of unsexy shit work out there that needs to be done Count your eggs before you start baking There is an economics of labor to why activism circles have shrunk Be mindful of the time and hands you have available when deciding what work youre able to take on Build tolerance build coalitions Small organizing means you cant afford to fracture over every little disagreement Decide your mission and your values from the start the things that are nonnegotiable and dont get hung up on the rest Be prepared to work with people you dont like Focus on the task at hand Network Know what other related or likeminded projects are out there whether they are groups like yours in other areas or groups in your community who are doing work that intersects with yours Be there for people Step up Offer to help Even outside an organizing structure if you become the kind of person who shows up and helps people will remember you and they will reach out to you when need arises If youve spent any time organizing youll know numbers 4 and 5 cannot be overstated Number 5 is the biggest reason organizing groups dont stick around Organizing is work Youre asking people to do a job outside of their job Its important to commit to WAY LESS than you want to Its also SO important that someone is the documentarian This is why a lot of the work doesnt get passed on when the initial group of folks burns out These points are also good litmus tests if youre looking to join a group If theyre committing to a lot and expect a lot from you try setting some clear boundaries about what you can do sustainably If theres major push back andor shaming for suggesting to do lessRUN That group will burn you out SO quick Similarly if they dont have any documentation then they havent paused to do the boring structural work that is necessary to keep a group going The thing about requests to get involved and stay engaged is they dont often really tell you how to do that And as OP points out even if youre lucky enough to live in a place where theres some community infrastructure already in place like mutual aid groups these are often small disorganized or out of energy And thats because community organizing is a skill Its not a skill many of us have and its not a skill most of us are taughtbut its a skill you can learn like any other Theres an excellent article going around by Daniel Hunter that gives you a really quick intro to some of the ways organizers thinkits strategic practical and goaloriented Marshall Ganz and the Leading Change Network is another excellent resource For those of you who remember Howard Deans primary campaign in 04 and its commitment to grassrootscommunitybased organizing and smalldollar fundraisingit was rooted in Ganzs work And yes I worked that campaign mumbletymany years ago I grew up with parents who were politically active and politically engagedwe talked politics and we did do things like go to marches sign petitions and go to rallies My dad took me to my first and second and third antiwar rally during the Bush years But as Ive gotten older Ive learned that the kind of political engagement they taught me is importantbut it isnt really about getting things done Thats community organizing Im still a neophyte at community organizing Its okay if you are too Many of us werent taught it but its a skill that can be learned If youre trying to find a way to get involved or find a mutual aid group but are struggling the above commentary is excellent once youve found a group If the question really is how to find a groupwell thats a tough one If you live in a bigger city you can probably find some good starting points by googling community organizing NYC or whatever You also might check out the organizations on this list sorry its a picture and not textits from the former organizing arm of the Obama campaign to see if they have any local chapters near you If youre in a small town as I am you might need to be more issuefocused My town has a social services coordinator and theres a foodandfuel fund for lowerincome residents see if your town has similar organizations and talk to the leaders Andone more thing if youll forgive the aside You dont have to do everything If what you really care about is press freedomor immigrant rightsor defending the separation of church and stateor climate actionor antiracism activismor union organizingits okay to channel your energies towards just one cause Theres a lot of work thatll need to be done over the next four years As notes burnout is a real risk Trust that you dont have to do it all Find your niche and other people will find theirs,0,0.9986,0

Holiday Shopping that fights period poverty for college students Yep Read on nerdykeppie Holiday Shopping that fights period poverty for college students Yep Read on After the success of our JunePride sales goal where we managed to eliminate a lot of the debt we accumulated while I was unable to work earlier this year stock up cash so we didnt have to borrow for payroll during the fall lull and also donate to we were considering where to focus on this year when a conversation I had with my mom pointed me in the direction of our charity for Holidays the East Stroudsburg University Warrior Food Pantry and specifically stocking menstrual products at the pantry Without getting too much into the weeds about the details which Ill talk about under the cut for those of you who are interested heres the pitch we need to hit a gross sales goal of 45K in December in order to pay our bills and payroll basically until Pride starts up Businesses like ours are very much feast or famine and weve got to eat and weve got people whose paychecks depend on us having the cash to pay them If we hit that goal well donate the equivalent of 1 of our net profit from the month of December in period products tampons and pads specifically by request of the food pantry and possibly reusable pads and menstrual cups if the pantry wants that from us At the end of the day this is about taking care of people the way they need and well listen to the pantry staff about what people are requesting Weve currently got our Bottoms Tops sale going too so you can buy 2 tops or bottoms from the linked collection get 69 off the 3rd item from that collection Bottoms Tops Sale Okay so for the long version whys and wherefores My mom taught math at ESU for 35 years and she and Dad now volunteer running the food pantry along with a couple of other people ESU is a state school and as such is one of the few remaining vaguely affordable schools in Pennsylvania A lot of its students are selfsupporting for one reason or another many are nontraditionaladult students have kids or dont have families that can support them while they go to school Mom Dad have pushed to expand what the food pantry offers to personal care items which has been difficult due to a bunch of boring stuff about money and state entities and also people thinking thats not food but Mom is stubborn about it because to paraphrase her how can you focus on class when you feel gross This struggle has been especially difficult for menstrual products and way more so for tampons because its a rather conservative area and yeah People get weird about it Ive been really broke with a young kid and reliant on food pantries which rarely if ever have any menstrual products let alone tampons Period poverty is very real and it sucks Plus I gotta tell you if we can send a bunch of boxes of tampons and pads to the food pantry well Rumor has it this will help my mom win an argument over whether those items should be carried at all because what are they gonna do throw them out Theyre here Theyve been donated Wasting them would be terrible So thats the pitch guys Help me make a direct measurable difference in the lives of people at the school where I went to winter swim team the school that fed me growing up and help my mom win an argument about making peoples lives better and get your holiday shopping done while you do We start counting sales from the minute I hit post P,0,0.3256,0

My Two Legs are Broken But Look at Me Dance My Two Legs are Broken But Look at Me Dance I know at least two people I know personally who can see this so I want to make this explicit I am not in danger Ive been through this many times before Ill do it again It has just gotten easier to write than to talk now While riding back home with some friends one of them brought up a very good point I dealtdeal with all of the fear pain and shame that cancer brings so taking on smaller ordeals pale in comparison And this was very much the case during the initial phase of my diagnosis I like so many folk have depression that ranges from a fog to a typhoon From still being able to laugh to wishing I stopped breathing And during some of my cancer treatment that largely stopped Funnily enough my suicidality was scared of the actual threat of death My landlord had extended grace a few family members and friends stepped up to support I had things to be grateful for including getting one of the more treatable versions of cancer and finally being able to feel almost normal on the nonchemo weeks I was in maintenance mode and I did not have enough available resources for depressionexe to run This did not last very long even during treatment Im looking through my notes now and seeing how much I broke down during the latter half of treatment I read over the note in August of how I was awake crying at 4 AM wishing my mother was still alive so I could talk to her about how much I was suffering even through I never fully opened to her like that before she passed And now I am left in remission grateful for the status but struggling with everything that entails The depression and selfloathing is back and stronger than ever latching onto the physical and mental setbacks the diagnosis and treatment left I feel disconnected from cancer patients and communities even though I am only a monthlong survivor and am at the highest risk for recurrence I feel incapable to reenter the world as I my landlord and those that depend on me need me to I am stuck in limbo too broken to ascend and too well to descend Throw in my growing feelings of dystopia around trying to get a job and what the rest of my life feels like it will feel like and I in some ways feel worse than when I was going through treatment Like I went through the suffering to possibly have a future but I am too incompetent and afraid and depressed to actually have one Is this just gonna be it I get a job that pays just enough for me to lose my food and medical assistance and I cant afford the treatment when I relapse Im stuck being this fat and stupid and looked down upon in my professional and personal life as I should be I keep stressing and feeling like I am never enough and dont have enough in me to be a person or really enjoy things What is the point What did I fight for,1,-0.9954,0

SoI had breast cancer And it was terrible And whatever is left isalso terrible I did everything I was supposed to I SoI had breast cancer And it was terrible And whatever is left isalso terrible I did everything I was supposed to I went to the doctor and got my scans They found a suspicious spot but after an ultrasound I was cleared and worryfree Eight months later I was diagnosed with Stage 3A Invasive Ductal Carcinoma I was so angry but mostly terrified Everything about early diagnosis is awful All of the scans and tests are incredibly painful which I really didnt expect The biopsy consisted of me holding a young nurses hand and her crying with me while the doctor basically stabbed a nail through my breast to collect tumor tissue It hurt so badly Then when I had my first MRI I was lying face down but on a ramp with my breasts hanging down Unnatural and also of course incredibly painful I was just started to call out and ask them to please stop when Justin Biebers Stay came on the headphones and I didnt feel all alone anymore I knew that I immediately wanted my breasts gone Both of them gone Immediately It didnt matter that my right breast hadnt betrayed me my killer left boob had made the decision for both of them Two weeks after diagnosis I had my double mastectomy I was so pitiful after that that I even made the nurses cry I had a male nurse come in and check on me the next day and he told me hed gone home crying I must have been awful Thankfully I dont remember it I think most of it was because they wouldnt let my then four year old in to see me I did get to see my two older boys though thank goodness My friends dyed my hair a beautiful pink I had never dyed my hair before and I was so happy with the outcome I could have kept that beautiful color forever I went straight into chemo The Red Devil was every two weeks and at one point I remember sitting in my kitchen wondering if I was dying I think I probably was I was also bald now No nose hair no eyebrows or eyelashes nothing I looked like a turtle But I was too sick to really care I didnt even mind the Neulasta shot every two weeks I moved on into Taxol and it was actually just as bad for me During this time I was put into the ICU with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs MANY and was on oxygen for months The night before I was hospitalized I told my middle son I felt like I was being stabbed in the back but hey It was just massive blood clots sigh After chemo I found out that I now have Lymphedema If you know what Lymphedema is you know how terrible this is If you dont let me just tell you its so terrible When I had my double mastectomy they also removed 39 of my lymph nodes under my left arm and six of them were cancerous And now the fluid doesnt drain from my arm and gets stuck in my arm and chest and neck and I am miserable I did treatement and have a pump and wear sleeves and all that but it is still miserable At the end of chemo and beginning of radiation I bought a house I want you to know I remember none of it But I love it I wasnt expecting radiation to be bad but of course it was awful Nothing about cancer is fun The burns burned The skin broke The pain pained My stomach did NOT stomach It was truly terrible After that I had a year of injections And a total hysterectomy And pills And bone pain depression anxiety nightmares hot flashes and finally heart surgery It was a hell of a couple of years And if theyd diagnosed it when I got my first mammogram I dont think half of it would have happened Whats happening now though is that cancer never really left me Its always on my mind and in my thoughts With every pain and ache Im convinced its back to get me I hope that this anxiety and fear eventually leave me Please get your scans and check ups when theyre due Take every step you need to take You want to stick around even when things look bleak Theres always a better day coming,1,-0.9988,0

So its Lymphoma Awareness Week And Im gonna make you all aware Hodgkins Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer It affects the lymphatic system Out of all the cancers to have its a pretty curable cancer to have with stages 1 and 2 being 93 cured after treatment Though it gets a little tricky in the advanced stages Usually it can be treated with chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy too if youre not clear after the first two months of chemo Not many people are actually aware of what lymphoma is or that its a cancer Many have no clue what your lymph nodes do Lymph nodes are part of the immune system so you can imagine its pretty necessary for them to be working To go into how they work and what they do will actually take me ages so I wont bore you if you are reading P Anyways I know so much about it is because I had it two years ago And it was bloody hell I had stage 4 and it was legit EVERYWHERE like its not even exaggerated I have 6 months of chemo and 11 sessions of radiotherapy It was hell I had a bunch of mental breakdowns and issues and Im still seeing a shrink bu t thats not the point The point is I survived I met a girl at a Teens Unite Fighting Cancer sessions thing a few weeks agao and she never understood why I never told anyone about my cancer and why I didnt get support from people The truth is I was an idiot and I really should have told people but what is done is done Too late to change it now She said that making people aware of the different types of cancers can push people to fundraise more and help find a cure And she was right So Im awareing people of it now Because it is a rare disease to get and not many people are aware If I had know more about the symptoms and what it actually was it wouldnt have gotten to the stage that it did And that you can help find a cure and help those who need it the most Im doing to help others and to make you aware of what it is Yeah I think thats enough babbling If you read it all thanks Oh and here are a few links that might help too,0,0.8858,1

So I answered a Q A The contents resulted in a pretty good synopsis of my health during the past few years so Im adding it So I answered a Q A The contents resulted in a pretty good synopsis of my health during the past few years so Im adding it here I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about 8 years ago I immediately lost about 20 lbs and my blood glucose did go down I resented being diagnosed just days before Halloween as I looked forward to all that food coming in the holidays But that first set of holidays I persevered I have struggled with motivation to be good and my resolve has often lapsed Now I have been diagnosed with Stage IV malignant melanoma which is way more than just skin cancer Have had lesions removed from my back a huge mass removed from my right arm and am getting treatment for the mass in my lung Im getting a biopsy on a lump in my breast sometime next week and an ultrasound on my thyroid probably at the same time With all that worry my glucose levels have rollercoasted as have my emotions However I figure in my more sanityguided moments I will let the docs deal with the cancer and try to pay attention to the diabetes Most days I find myself After work substitute teaching I am fatigued so I might nap then feed the dogs give one of them her insulin have some kind of dinner myself and cloister myself to catch up on Netflix or some show Or I try to research the cancer I have and learn about treatment therapies Given what I know now I would recommend others Everyones situation is different I do recommend some self evaluation Writing in a journal the food I eat the mood Im in events of the day that might trigger overeating etc help me greatly to understand whats happening in my mind to motivate indulgence that might not be the best choice for my body What I could use is suggestions for ways to treat myself or reward or console myself that dont involve food or money My life has changed in this way Mostly I feel nearly defeated Sometimes Im resentful I was always physically active running skiing tennis biking and swimming Injuries forced me to stop in my 30s and 40s I became sort of a sloth Ive moved into a threestory home and I do walk up and down several times each day I know I need to do more The first door my front door is the most challenging to get through when I need to exercise,1,-0.5442,1

stand up to cancer I stand up to cancer I wanted to just share this with anyone who has just been diagnosed with cancer in the hope it may help I know all cancers are different a year ago this week after months of ever increasing pain in my lower back I was finally told the words that we all dread Im sorry to say you have cancer in some ways for me this was a relief in a strange kind of way at least it explained the ferocious pain I was experiencing that just got worse and worse to the point I could hardly move For months it was diagnosed as sciatica I guess I had the similar simptoms It got worse when a few weeks later my world totally disintegrated when I learnt it was advanced agressive prostate cancer The pain was from Bone Mets that has fractured my vertibrae in several places as well as limph nodes the cancer had also spread to my pelvis I was in a bad state with no light at the end of the tunnel Im 55 with two daughters ages 12 14 my world as well as my back was collapsing That was a year ago Now Im back to work full time as an ambulance driving instructor my pain levels are managed and Ive completely changed my life style from diet to mindset Im a different person but in the same body The tumours have shrunk considerably although my doctor keeps reminding me its incurable They say Woody keep doing it whatever it is you are doing I steadfastly refuse to believe that its incurable and I refuse to let my illness become the centre of my life My life has changed so much not all of it for the worse I appreciate life far more than I have ever done Im grateful for each day and what it brings My body has been majorly affected by hormone treatment but at least its keeping me living Im thankful for the simple things I know longer strive to have what I cant have Im happy contented and yet supposedly dying Cancer is no longer the center attraction life goes on My message is no matter what you have to keep believing Keep positive I live by three things be kind to all I meet and try to make a difference in some way be grateful for what I have and stay positive no matter how bad it seems A year ago I thought my life was over if this is you in a similar situation dont let the cancer take over stand up to it and live your life the best way you can I hope this helps someone out there Woody,0,0.6143,1
Update time for the few actually watching this I had a follow up with the cancer center today after receiving the report two Update time for the few actually watching this I had a follow up with the cancer center today after receiving the report two days ago via email without knowing how to interpret it I have Glioblastoma multiforme stage 4 which was the original diagnosis instead of Oligodendroglioma stage 3 BUT its actually better weirdly enough Glio and Oligo are more or less the same but the Oligo has 1p and 19q chromosome deletion This does not Glio is the scarier form of cancer because of the overall mortality rate of 96 over two years but because of the genes present I have a more favorable prognosis with glioblastoma than Oligodendroglioma I have a super high concentration of an mgmt wild type gene Wild type means there is no mutation present and it responds better to chemo and radiation than Oligodendroglioma My KI67 was lower than expected as well Thats what determines overall tumor growth rate He said of the 4 of patients that survive past 2 years I have the highest possible chance of not only living beyond that but actually beating it to some degree I wont live to retirement age certainly but there is some rare cases where people live years That wild type gene is essential to get through this The cost of treatment is astronomical but debt means nothing if I can get through this and be there for my children Its the best possible conditions for a not so good situation Ive learned alot of humility and grace through all of this and its only been 5 weeks I no longer hold grudges against anyone or anything Reach out Let each other know its okay to not be okay But most importantly dont ignore any warning signs your body is trying to tell you about Also the nurse loved my mask and couldnt keep a straight face,0,0.9578,1
To Share Or Not To Share To Share Or Not To Share There is no rule book for cancer No guidelines to tell you how you are supposed to feel or act No list God how I love a list of tasks to check off But to me there has never been a question of not sharing this journey with the people in my life How are people supposed to support you show empathy and general kindness if they dont know what you are going through And lets face it Ive always worn my heart on my sleeve so why should this be any different So Ill use this blog as a place to inform you all of my progress vent my frustrations and maybe help others who find themselves in this impossible situation because the fact is that we do not talk about cancer enough Before my initial diagnosis in I had never even heard of my particular kind of cancer GIST and every single person I talked to about it outside of the medical profession had never heard of it either I had no idea what I was dealing with The current situation is thus I have five tumours in my abdomen of varying sizes The biggest is just over 2cm The original singular gist was around 12cm This recurrence is metastatic more than one tumour never a word you want to hear when dealing with cancer but the good news is that they are all in the same place and havent migrated to other parts of my body Surgery is not possible so Im being placed onto an oral chemotherapy drug called Imatinib The aim of the drug is to prevent the tumours from growingspreading further and if Im really lucky shrink them into oblivion My oncologist gave about an 80 chance of that happening There is a chance though that one or more of the tumours will be resistant to the Imatinib and grow in which case they would consider surgery on those stubborn clumps There is also a chance that the Imatinib wont work at all in which case there are currently 4 other drugs that they could try to get it under control She estimated that if the Imatinib is successful then on average it works for 3 years When the tumours inevitably become resistant its time to try the next drug Best case scenario is that the Imatinib works immediately and the next scan in 3 months shows that they have shrunk or disappeared However if this happens I still have to take the drugs For life This is because what we do know about this rare cancer is that it is aggressive and while it may not always be big enough to show up on a CT scan it is always going to be there lurking even if it is just a microscopic cell I really appreciate honesty and thankfully my oncologist does not sugarcoat anything the word she used was incurable and whilst that word is terrifying I think in the long term its best to know this Though she does remain otpimistic that I should be around for a long time yet So this is where were at This is what Im trying to process Ill blog again after Ive gathered my thoughts further,0,0.9697,1

Makeup Toxicity Makeup Toxicity I like many people of my generation love makeup Growing up during the late s and s cosmetic influencers played a very important role To this day there are many young Gen Zers and Gen Alphas that are coming into contact with makeup content and generally love cosmetics Cosmetics are not just make up A cosmetic is any substance used to clean improve or change the complexion skin hair nails or teeth Cosmetics include beauty preparations makeup perfume skin cream nail polish and grooming aids soap shampoo shaving cream deodorant We dont discuss enough how absolutely dangerous some of these products are on the market Im not just talking about your cheap dollar store makeup I am talking about your super popular favorite eyeshadow palettes your 60 foundation and your most loved mascara I am talking about your body wash lotion and even your aluminum free deodorant Your toothpaste your hair creams and your gel nail polish that you cure with a uv lamp These chemicals are being placed on parts of your body that are supremely delicate and your body is processing or not all of the materials within those products I feel completely psychotic writing this all down and I doubt anyone will stop to read You probably already think Im crazy But when it comes to cancer we shouldnt play around and although cancer related deaths have gone down due to medical advances in treatment and pharmaceuticals we still need to have a discussion on why it is rates of cancer are going up so rapidly in the under 50 category I am not for banning every single chemical that has a minute chance of causing cancer or endocrine disruption but I am for smarter and longer studies of the chemicals being placed in our daily cosmetics A lot of these cosmetic companies are given the go ahead to release their products to the public as long as they do not cause any dramatic allergic reactions but we need to be practical and make sure that the FDA is doing their due diligence Most of us grew up eating frozen dinners out of plastic microwaved trays we had Johnson Johnson baby powder placed on our bodies daily we worewear chemical filled deodorant and still continue to bathe ourselves in very unnatural but nice smelling soaps And as for POC like myself we grew up from a young age getting relaxers done on our hair and keratin treatments It is not logical or rational to say that one item in your regimen is going to cause terminal cancer but a life long interaction with a multitude of products that can raise your chances you need to ask yourself these questions What is this Where did it come from Why am I doing this And is it worth it I can talk about a million different things that we need to change in this world like what is our furniture made up of and are you sure your home was built with materials that are safe for you to live in what about your mattress Are you cooking with plastic utensils eating off of plastic plates and cooking on a scratched up nonstick pan Cause I know I am I have And Im learning that much of the things that are natural to me in this world are not safe Much of the food and products we consume on the daily are putting our families at risk So please do your due diligence and take care of yourself in a way that your government wont,0,0.8725,1

The Institution of work warning rambling stream of consciousness Ive written a bit about closure and normalization But over the last few weeks Ive come to realize that its a moving target And perhaps one without a bullseye Im still struggling with finding a postcareer cancerylife new normal Unlike retirement I didnt plan for on this and the decision to stop working came somewhat suddenly Its been quite an awakening as to just how much work had dominated my life Career work Isnt it interesting how we use these words to try and compartmentalize what in many cases is really the driving force in our lives Maybe the illusion of compartmentalization is universal How else could so many of us allow a job to rule our lives Ask anyone who knows me well and I think they would say that I was someone who had a full life outside of work But despite that the job always won out in the end If there was a project that needed completing and there were always projects or some other important thing that needed to get done I did it For many years running I never used all of my vacation and often had more than half of it left to carry over into the following year I kept telling myself I was saving up for the big trip but never got around to taking it Even after I was diagnosed and should have been totally focused on my own needs I allowed work to keep running my life I had two major surges in aggressive disease activity that may have been driven in a large part by excessive work stress Yup I can be a slow learner I would tell myself that working was the best way to keep my mind off the fact that I had stage IV disease and ultimately a terminal diagnosis Now in retrospect what the hell was I thinking That somehow my job was going to make it all go away Or that I could keep going on like this was just a chronic disease Even more troubling that I was somehow so important to the institution that it trumped my health And was it that important to my self esteem All of these questions have been swirling around in my head as I try to make sense out of the whole thing Several months ago my buddy Tim who is a Professor of Philosophy used his considerable skills of reasoning to convince me that my worries about going out on disability were unfounded I had managed to go off on a moral tangent thinking that I wasnt sick enough to become a burden on society And I was also rambling on about how important my work was His arguments being that one I have stage IV cancer and it didnt matter if I was still mostly physically able to work and two the institution wouldnt really care that I was gone He wasnt talking about the people I worked with but rather the actual institution the thing that I worked for Talk about stopping dead in my tracks I was already starting to come around to the first argument thanks to the frequent reminders from my Oncology team but number two that was something I hadnt considered It wasnt that I saw myself as irreplaceable but I rather that I felt I was contributing to something important something bigger than myself so to speak But his words cut right through all that It the institution would just keep right on going without missing a beat People would miss me and things would change because of my absence but my contributions would begin to fade to the point of becoming nothing more than passing memories How could it be any different Thats how the world works whether we want to face up to it or not It goes back to that Buddhist thing Ive talked about so often impermanence My career was just as impermanent as everything thing else It ended with no fanfare or accolades the kind of stuff we aspired to in academia no gold watch or retirement I just quietly slipped away And now Now Ill fade from the institutional memory Its already happening It took that revelation to help me break free of the self imposed institution of work as Ive come to think of it Over the weekend Tim and I talked about all of this again and it made me realize just how far Ive come And its ok,1,-0.9608,1

Part 2 When your thoughts are not your own I was so focused on the pharmacologically induced aspect of this that I totally spaced out on the other side of the cointhe emotional impact of incurable cancer I honestly dont know which has more of an effect and suppose it doesnt really matter its a package deal But the stress fear and depression that come along with what was essentially a terminal diagnosis are all part of the equation They all mess with your head PTSD is often sited in the literature as an issue for cancer survivors But I dont run across as many references regarding its impact on stage IV patients I have no doubt that it plays a role just hang out with me on lab work days My motive for writing about this isnt to elicit a poor Greg response Its just another way for me to try and rationalize and externalize whats happening Ive always been someone who spent too much time living inside my own head and now thats not a very healthy place to be Its also a lot to unload on your friends in face to face conversations So I put it down in written words that anyone can take or leave Including me And just to be clear cancer hasnt turned me into some sort of voices in my head whackjob Call this my version of talk therapy Its just a lot of shit to deal with,1,-0.9869,1

gitli justsomeantifas justsomeantifas justsomeantifas im so sick of tiktok nurses and doctors trying to mock their patients for coming in and saying their pain is at a ten but not performing the pain for them every time ive been in the hospital near death i was simply too exhausted to perform pain for these people it was a ten on the pain scale but they thought i was faking it for whatever reason until they got my lab tests back and realized i would need to be checked in for quite a while like maybe you able bodied young doctornurse who has never experienced chronic pain and disability cannot fathom me rolling up near death and a flat expression unable to scream and holler about my agonies but I assure you some of us are just too fucking tired to scream about something we generally live with every single day on god wanna punch the smug off their faces where do these people who have never experienced the pains theyre trying to judge others rankings get off mocking how chronically ill people express themselves one video in particular drives me up the wall as it is some young nurse pretending to do patient intake in the ER and he is both the patient and nurse so he asks himself what would you rank your head pain and he the patient flatly without emotion is like ten so skeptically he as the nurse is like so ten is the worst pain youve ever felt like if someone with a chainsaw cut off your arm right now how would you rank your pain knowing that and he as the patient flippantly is like 95 and the whole joke is yeah youre lying but this situation really happened to my brother he has a brain tumor and brain swelling to where he was dying but was in too much pain to express it in a way an intake nurse would recognize as legitimate pain so ofc they blew him off and he did get way too close to death because of that not all of us express extreme pains the same also need i fucking remind anyone head pain and head injuries specifically can alter how you express your emotions and moods theres a case of a man being literally shot in the head and he said he was in a lot of pain but everyone ignored that because he kept forgetting to act out the pain I have Cerebral Palsy I walk and stand in eays that are not natural for our bones and after 28 years that shit hurts All the time Its hurt my entire life so I have a God damn HIGH pain tolerance Add onto that that my parents actively told me not to perform my pain I was told that expressing or showing that I was hurting was selfish annoying and needy Whats the end result of that I get to an 8 on the pain scale and the only ways I perform that high of a pain are Deep breathing Closing my eyes against it Pinching my nose Maybe rubbing the bones that hurt if I can reach it I spent the last 5 or 6 years with my daily average being a 6 and I would hit an 8 at least 3 times a week Constantly being in that amount of pain means that you earn to mask it very well And yeah when Im in terrible pain seeing double about to puke my voice is flat as fuck I turn really pale but I keep my mouth shut Ive had doctors not believe my pain levels were that high regularly and all it did was make me reluctant to reach out for help managing my pain They also refuse to believe my pain is that bad and yet Im not taking opioidbased pain medication I dont because Im an addict Same reason I dont keep a giant bottle of vodka in my house I wont but I also CANT I promise if I did Id become a raging alcoholic just like one of my grandmothers My point though is that people are sometimes taught that they arent even allowed to perform pain or discomfort and fuck those doctors and nurses who mock their patients or dont believe them I literally had my back broken in four places as a kid and had to wait for my dad to essentially force the supervisors where I was working to take me to the hospital because all I could do was sit and cry silently and they insisted Id be screaming my head off if it was that bad My older brother has Downs Syndrome Hes really good at masking his pain Like when he was 7 he had tonsillitis and my parents didnt know until he passed out because he didnt tell them he wasnt feeling well We have to watch him to figure out if hes hurting and it scares the shit out of me that a doctor or nurse might not believe that hes in pain because he doesnt show it Would like to again point out my experience from being a firefighteremt who has had to do triage at multicar pile ups Dead people dont scream The more hurt someone is the quieter they are People who are screaming are breathing People running around and shouting for help have brain and motor function Its the person quietly sitting still on the corner who is going into shock from internal bleeding Also some people are just built different Ive had a person with a broken leg offer to limp themself to the ambulance I had a woman complain of foot pain apologized for calling over something trivial and when we put her on the 4 lead heart monitor she was clearly having a minor heart attack The heart attack was presenting weird symptoms which is not unusual for woman as they have higher pain tolerances than men If we had assumed she was just being dramatic and skipped the ECG part of the assessment protocol she could have fucking died This is why when you go to the hospital every medical person who sees you keeps asking the same questions We dont know if the last asshat who did an assessment missed something important also like if I performed my pain according to expectations Id probably be shouting all day and crying all night instead of doing literally anything useful entertaining or even distracting I feel like this would start annoying my housemates fast and me faster so like how about I save

Experiments in Live streaming Live streaming on Reddit I have done two live streams on Reddit both times they lasted for over 3 hours and both times I was using the experience to gauge what resonates with people that watch me I discovered Reddit 6 weeks back and I had to wait 4 weeks and get karma points before I could live stream on Reddit You get Karma points for posting and commenting the idea is you give back before you take if that makes sense you cant actually broadcast until youve proven that youre willing to become a member of the community and the four weeks grace period plus karma points you need shows this commitment These rules apply to anybody that wants to broadcast so it is an antispam measure it stops people from coming on posting and running on flooding the site with spam which people will do if given the chance The theme The title of my stream is I am immunocompromised and stuck at home come and chat with me I am used to working an audience it is something I have done many times over the years with a lot of personal appearances so I know roughly what it is that they want from me when I reveal that Im the worlds fastest talker However sometimes they discover it before I mention it and other times I must mention it to get the conversation going because the way I like to do it is to take my cues from the watchers I like them to tell me what they want me to chat about I have some fallback chat that I can start just talking with which I do I have two life experiences I have my cancer which I can talk for hours about and I have my worlds fastest talker world record which again I can talk for hours about On both streams I decided to start with the cancer the immunosuppression and how I am shielding at home and have been for the last 2 years The chat It started with a few people chatting to me and just generally asking me about whether Id really been a selfimposed prisoner in my own home for the last two years so I talked about that and what I see is the future which is me not going out anywhere except for medical appointments I have a funny feeling this virus will be with us for a long time probably endemic like the common cold which means Im going to have to keep away from people I spoke about the decisions that Ive got ahead of me whether I have to struggle to go back out to work and possibly risk dying of COVID or stay at home and be poor because Ive had a lot of my benefits cut we also touched on various other subjects Somebody else asked if I was religious and Im not so I replied that I was a quizzical agnostic and they asked me what that was and I said well the klu Klux Klan put crosses in peoples front garden and set fire to them and instead I do it with question marks I dont think they got the joke there so and I explained that I wasnt religious at all and a couple of people asked me how I live with cancer and I explained that I just do it it is what it is and I just carry on carrying on apparently Ive got Ive got an amazing attitude The tangents Somebody else asked me about American gun control I mean why they would ask somebody British about American gun control Its something that just amazes me I guess its because we dont have guns or we do have guns but I explained it its different its a different kind of society here were not all gun crazy we dont need to have guns yes I explained that we had two hope high profile massacres the Hungerford massacre in the s which meant the end of owning assault weapons and then the Dunblane massacre in the 90s where automatic weapons and revolvers were outlawed I tried to explain that realistically we have a sort of voluntary gun control contrary to popular belief we can own guns but as a populace the vast majority of us choose not to The law is if you want to own a shotgun or a long rifle you must show a need for one selfdefence is not considered a need I live in a city I live in London why would I need a gun in London there is no reason for me to have a gun if you dismiss selfdefence and Im not going to hunt anything the biggest wild animal in this country is a fox so theres nothing really to hunt and because nobody else has got guns I dont need a gun its a different culture completely different gun culture here to what is in America so I dont feel qualified to speak on American gun control apart from the fact that its probably our the British fault that the right to bear arms exist because if my history serves me correctly it was part of the American constitution which was formed after they kicked the British out and the whole reason for having a wellarmed militia I think thats the phrase in the constitutional well armed militia was in case we came back and they have ready army on hand to defend their homeland So yeah you could say realistically the American gun culture is our fault but other than that Im not really qualified to speak on their gun culture its their country their gun culture I can only see it from the outside what I see does horrify me but thats the way it is Then we got talking about my world records and I showed a couple of videos and thats how the conversations have gone and Ive managed to fill three hours We were talking about this and that an it just seemed like the three hours just flew past we touched on the beer I was drinking with a discussion about real ale we had some discussions about regional accents in the UK and apparently theres no accents in Eritrea The time just evaporated And it just it was just amazing at how quickly the three hours went its a novel experience to say the least and I quite enjoy it It did leave me very worn out but thats what happens I guess Im going to try again tonight at after 9 oclock this time coz I want to try it different times of day in

The situation in Ukraine Ukraine March I dont claim to be any sort of military strategist I do have claim to be a student of history history was my favourite subject at school also something I studied in further education and have had an interest in ever since History has taught me that there are only two ways to capture a city Encirclement and siege or scorched earth There doesnt appear to have been any inbetween these 2 options World War 2 and to a lesser extent the wars since then have shown that armour is very ineffective in a city environment and also very vulnerable A Molotov cocktail thrown by a single person onto a tank moving slowly through an urban street has the potential to destroy that tank Armour needs to be able to manoeuvre to both protect itself and project its power its far better suited to wide open fields and plans where it can rain down its destruction from a distance putting it inside an urban environment negates both its manoeuvrability and its ability to attack from a distance The only way to make a city a suitable environment for armour is to clear it building by building and then to level those buildings A very long and very brutal process that would cost countless lives on both sides The other choice is siege This is another long term strategy and ties up massive amounts of resources as you have to encircle the city and cut off every avenue of supply completely very hard to do in the modern world There appears to be no inbetween these 2 choices apart from the hope that the defenders of the city just surrender and to make that happen the attacker needs to become so brutal that the defenders think surrendering is the only way to save themselves to do this means starting a scorched earth policy There is of course in the modern world another option the option to just wipe that city out in an instant but even thats a double edged sword because you put your own encircling forces in harms way If I had to guess what Putins intentions were then looking back at history I would say the massive amount of armour he is moving in is for encirclement and siege so this look like its a long term strategy developing and wont be over any time soon Read the full article,1,-0.9062,1
Cancer update Mar Haematology Appointment Feb I went to the cancer unit of my hospital for what I thought was going to be a routine appointment I should have guessed it was going to be a little different because they did not have me booked in for a blood test which is very unusual The letter when I get the letter telling me when my next haematology appointment is it always states that I should turn up 30 minutes earlier for a blood test which is what happened with this letter and this visit but there was no blood test this time Seeing the Doctor When I went in to see the haematologist I should have guessed that it was going to be a different appointment because the clinical nurse specialist was also there which is unusual She doesnt normally take part in any visits to the haematologist I was also seeing a haematologist that I had not seen before I already like her because shes honest and straight forward and gives it to me without any sugar coating which is exactly what she did The news She told me that my case had been discussed with the team and they looked at the results of my scan or rather they looked at the results of my recent scan and could confirm that my cancer was spreading that didnt come as a surprise to me because Ive been exhibiting symptoms for the last few weeks which is why they decided to put me back on chemotherapy at the beginning of the year She also told me that if the current treatment I was on wasnt working and I started to exhibit more or worsening symptoms they would change my chemotherapy regimen to RCHOP which is a much more aggressive chemotherapy this is the one where you lose your hair and other nasty side effects The rhetoric had also changed normally they say treatment but she said at this point everything was now geared towards keeping me alive when I queried her on her choice of wording she said again my cancer had spread and that going forward they were aiming to keep me alive More unwelcome news We also discussed something else that had appeared on my most recent scan the consultant that reviewed it had spotted something on my pancreas and wanted a closer look so Im scheduled for another scan to look at my pancreas I have been exhibiting some symptoms which could be associated with pancreatic problems including two that are quite a quite noticeable the first one is my poo has been floating for about six weeks now every time I have a poo it floats when its solid most of the time its diarrhoea but it floats which is a sign that the fat in food isnt being absorbed properly thats a function of the pancreas Another one is Ive been having for the last two weeks excessive flatulence its quite noticeable these two signs alone are signs there is possibly something wrong with the pancreas if Im honest Im not expecting good news from the results of the next scan which should be in a weeks time but it is what it is I will deal with it and if its what I suspected it is I can only hope that its been caught early enough to be treated if its not well well cross that bridge when we come to it My partner says that I shouldnt think like this because Im just borrowing trouble the only issue there is its my body I know when somethings not right and somethings not right in my stomach area Since September last year and coupled with the pains Ive been experiencing and these new symptoms Ive been experiencing its telling me theres definitely something not right The fact that they want to have another look at my pancreas is leading me to a conclusion that possibly my cancer has spread to my pancreas Pancreatic cancer is not very nice cancer and in the last five years Ive had two good friends that have gone from being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer to death in under two months thats pancreatic cancer but maybe Im just looking on the bad side Maybe its not that maybe as my partner says I am borrowing trouble but in my head its plan for the worse and everything else is a bonus and lets be honest Ive been fighting cancer for over nine years probably longer because it was only nine years ago I was diagnosed my cancer it had probably been growing within me for three years previous to that so its fair to say that Ive been fighting cancer for 10 years now Ive had four lots of treatment and Ive beaten it back each time and Im not getting any younger and its fantastic that Ive had 10 years so I dont have any complaints We really didnt to discuss it that deeply because I think they want to see what the scan says but I think I know where this is going maybe Im just being pessimistic about it I dont know but I know when somethings not right and somethings not been right for a good few weeks with my body so Im preparing for the worst a depressing status I know More Shielding Another thing that came out of this meeting as we discussed COVID and the relaxing of the restrictions and how I was getting on with them with improving my core fitness and I pointed out that since the new COVID variant have become dominant at the end of last year Ive gone back to being a prisoner in my own home and Ive given up my gym membership so I dont go swimming I dont go out to the gym anymore to keep away from people but now that we are coming out of those restrictions I looked at them and I said can I go back out to going out in public and can I go back out to the gym and swimming and both the nurse and the haematologist looked at me with a look of horror and screamed NO at me in really loud voices So thats where we are were investigating my pancreas and it should happen in the next couple of weeks but were also looking at increasing the dosage of the medication that Im on gradually until its quadrupled from 5 milligrams where I am at the moment daily to 20 milligrams daily were looking at that being 10 months from now which effectively means weve written off this year as another year the I cant go out so this will now be my third year as social distancing prisoner Coming off the steroids Since the beginning of Jan 22 Ive also been on high dose steroids 30 milligrams per day and I was on those for four weeks and I felt absolutely fantastic they really made me feel good and they also stopped the pain in my stomach area meaning I didnt have to touch the morphine which is great The least amount of morphine I have to take the better you cant stay on steroids forever and you have to come off of them by ramping the dose down which I have been doing and Im ramping it down by 5 milligrams a week so Ive gone from daily 30 milligrams this week Ive started on the 15 milligrams per day so Im on the third week of the ramping and then next week it will be 10 milligrams I expressed concern that a lot of the way that Ive been feeling good was brought on by the steroids and they also were masking symptoms and as I am reducing the dose the stomach pains are coming back I expressed the concern that I was dreading coming off the steroids completely because I would go back to being the old me which was quite lethargic and being ill because everybody has noticed a difference in me these last few weeks have been on steroids Ive noticed how much Ive changed how much good its done me but like I said you cant be on them forever at least I assume that but the haematologist did say that will have a look and see whats happening once Im off the steroids and if necessary they can put me back on them again which is absolutely fantastic because if I do regress when Im off the steroids I know that Ive got that option to go back on them which is which is good but at the same time bad because like I say they dont like you on steroids long term but they are talking about me being on the then long term Then what we must do is work at a dose which is enough to keep me stable but the very minimum dose I am not expecting good news with the with the scan of my pancreas since Im exhibiting some other symptoms which are normally associated with pancreatic cancer and well see whats happening there Ive got appointment in a months time hopefully by then well have had the scan done and the results back and well see where were going from there I keep saying its a bit of a depressing status and maybe Ive got it wrong I dont know but we shall see but whatever it is Ill deal with it as I normally deal with it and Im just smile on Mentally I have prepared for the worst and I am good with it I really am the problem is going to be for others around me Lets hope I am wrong Read the full article,1,-0.9981,1

Ramping down steroids High dose steroids Back at the beginning of January my haematologist put me on a daily dose of thirty milligrams steroids the steroid they chose was Prednisolone I was put on this steroid for four weeks at the dose of thirty milligrams per day The feelgood factor There is no doubt about it these steroids made me feel good I had a mental energy and enthusiasm that I thought I had lost for good I started quite a few projects and even finished a few this is unusual for me because I normally start something never see it through but the steroids had a fantastic effect on me giving me the desire to see things through it was not just me that noticed it other people noticed how different I was on these steroids my partner did comment several times they appeared to have given me a new energy and more importantly they also reduced the pain in my side which was the primary goal You cannot stay on steroids forever Steroids are one of those drugs you can only spend a limited time on in my case they decided that four weeks at the high dose would be enough and then from week five onwards I had to ramp down the dose by five milligrams a week This meant on week 5 I was taking twentyfive milligrams a day then week 6 I was taking twenty milligrams a day this step down of five milligrams would happen until I was off the steroids As I reduced the dose I did not really notice the difference until halfway into the ten milligrams per day week the first notable sign that the steroids were reducing was the pain in my side this started to come back not as bad as it was before the steroids but enough to let me know it was there At about the same time I noticed this energy of mine was starting to waver and I just felt very lethargic and I really did not want to do very much and still do not It was good while it lasted It was good while it lasted and the high dose steroids gave me some respite from the pain and the fatigue However as Im stepping down the dose Im returning to how I was prior to the start of January I shall miss the energy the steroids give me but Ive got to come off them so I guess Ill just have to accept this is the way Last night I really struggled to get to sleep because of the pain and in the end the only way I could do it was by taking Oramorph This did the trick and knocked me out like a light when I woke up this morning though I felt absolutely awful nauseousness tired and just generally feeling like shit its taken most of the day so far before I started to feel normal again Steroids are good and bad when they work they really work well but coming down off them it is a bit of a nightmare I have got 8 days left of steroids and tomorrow I must cut the dose again to five milligrams per day stopping them altogether is something I am dreading but it is what it is and Ill just have to deal with it I will let you know how I get on in another post Read the full article,1,-0.9635,1

the strain off of the muscle which usually ends up in you cramping up an entirely different muscle and yet more pain This cramp can sometimes go on for minutes and then you spend the next day or so having an after pain which also hurts I tried everything the Doctors suggested I have follicular lymphoma an incurable cancer and along with this comes night cramps I have mentioned these to my Drs so many times now and between us we have tried everything I see you are on statins it must be those stop taking them So I did for 2 months and still the cramps happened every night without fail The doctors then went through all of my meds each time blaming one they stopped it and still the cramps continued They even blamed rituximab and when my course was over and I stopped it guess what the cramps still carried on Hot compresses they said didnt work Cold compresses they said didnt work Take quinine they said didnt work I had so many blood tests and they couldnt find anything wrong with my levels except for cancer related neutrophils lymphocytes and anaemia nothing in any blood test that would traditional traditionally lead to cramps like low magnesium or potassium The most useless piece of advice They kept telling me that when I cramped up the best thing I could do was to stretch the muscle that alone told me they had no idea what these cramps were like you cant stretch the muscle that just hurts even more then the cramp did these arent like the cramps that sports people suffer where a man with a sponge and a bottle of water make them go away they are deep and long last and they fucking hurt I mean really fucking hurt and trying to stretch the muscle just makes them fucking hurt even more I really was at my wits end These cramps were driving me nuts I really wasnt getting any quality sleep they were waking me up during the night then because I was so tired Id fall asleep during the day for several hours Then I came across a medical research paper which discussed that in the s miners and steel workers were suffering a very high incidence of agonising cramps during their shifts but more importantly this happened towards the end of their shifts and not the beginning Both the miners and steel workers worked in extremely hot conditions which caused them to sweat excessively and from that they deduced that when they were sweating they were losing salt The workers upped their salt consumption prior to starting a shift and the incidents of cramps decreased Night sweats are a part of lymphomas If you have lymphoma youll know all about the night sweats they are absolutely drenching ones and in fact they can even leave those salt stains on your bedclothes But is salt the answer sort of well its part of the answer Research done during the s and s into athletes that suffered cramp showed that during a cramp their salt levels were low but also other electrolytes as well the cramps were more common the more the athletes sweated beforehand In other words they were sweating away important electrolytes the body needed salt sodium being just one of them These were what they identified in the sweat Sodium magnesium potassium calcium These just happen to also be the minerals that make up of the majority of athletes hydration drinks Last thing at night With the research in mind at night I would make up a bottle of orange quash and add 1gram of electrolyte powder to it just to digress for a moment I used to take a bottle of water to put beside my bead that would drink when I woke up dehydrated after a sweat this wasnt a good thing because all I was doing was further diluting the few electrolytes I hadnt already sweated out Anyway my new orange squash hydration drink I would have a glass just before bed and keep the rest beside my bed for when I woke up in the night The results were instant I couldnt believe the very first night I tried this was the very first night I actually had a good nights sleep I went through the night without a single cramp Its now been over a month since my last night cramp and its great being able to sleep all through the night Made up drinks I now keep a bottle full of orange squash mixed with electrolyte powder beside my bed at night and if I do wake up to go to the loo or anything like that I take a few swigs from that because I still lose salt and other electrolytes through sweat I also make up a bottle of orange squash or other fruit juice with electrolytes to drink throughout the day just to make sure my levels are good Hopefully my cure for night cramps will also cure yours as well let me know in the comments how you got on Read the full article,1,-0.9751,1

Hard drive fun and games I had a Hard Drive HDD failure For about the last week my PC has been playing up and my E drive kept opening window to show me its contents all by itself As well as that I have had a bizarre dialogue box come up every now and again telling me the PC cant run this program and to contact the vendor The bizarre thing is that it wouldnt tell me which program it was I set aside the coming weekend to deal with these issues which I thought were caused by a rogue program so the plan was to start to uninstall programs starting with the ones I had most recently installed and working backwards until the one which was causing the issues had been removed If that didnt work I was just going to reset windows However on Saturday morning when I switched my PC on it took ages to boot up with the longest part being the wait for the bios splash screen that immediately told me that something had changed something hardware and that the bios was configuring itself to the new system Once it had booted I checked the PC and spotted straight away that my E drive was missing For both the BIOS and Windows failing to see and HDD can mean only one thing the HDD has failed for some reason I removed the faulty HDD I had 3 HDDs in my PC the C boot drive is a NVME drive 1 Toshiba 1TB 1 Seagate 1TB and 1 Seagate 4TB HDD so I shut the machine down and restarted it this time I went into the BIOS first and looked at the peripherals screen why Well I was going to remove the faulty HDD but I didnt know exactly which one it was so by going into the BIOS and seeing what HDDs the BIOS was seeing then by default the one it wasnt seeing was the faulty one On the peripherals screen the BIOS was seeing the Seagate 4TB and the Seagate 4TB HDDs This told me that the faulty HDD was the Seagate 1TB I shut the PC down and pulled it out from under the table to open it up As I worked out which drive was faulty I went straight to it disconnected it and removed it I then put the PC back together and booted into the BIOS screen this is to make the PC re read its configuration so it wont take so long to boot in future once I had checked it was seeing the remaining HDDs I then did a save and exit and carried on with the boot One it had rebooted I then told it to restart this is it did and it was back to its usual very fast boot time as it was before these issues started 12 years old When I upgrade a PC I remove the HDDs from the old one and reuse them in the new ones and keep a little note of which HDDs they were turns out the faulty one came from a PC I had built in so this drive had been trundling away in various machine for 12 years not bad I guess Rescuing the data The faulty drive was my downloads and MP3 drive this is where everything I downloaded was stored as well as my MP3 collection The downloads I wasnt bothered about because I can easily download the stuff again however the MP3s had been purchased from Amazon and I didnt want to lose them I have a Wavlink USB drive dock and cloner and I happen to have an older spare Seagate 1TB HDD so tried to clone the faulty drive but the Wavlink wasnt even seeing it Now HDDs fail for only a few reasons either the circuit board fails the arm gets stuck on a platter or the motor fails with either a circuit board or a motor failure its an easy fix and replacing them sorts it out and arm failing is slightly more complicated but it can be fixed and as long as the platters arent too badly damaged you can still get the data off of it First thing to try was the easiest swap out the circuit board this took about 10 mins and put the drive back into the USB dock and straight away it was read meaning the problem was indeed the old circuit board I then copied the data onto another drive in my pc then I swapped the circuit board back putting it back onto its original drive Why Well it might not have been the circuit board it might have been an arm or a motor failure and the movement taking it out and fiddling with it might have freed them regardless of that I dont trust a HDD once it starts playing up so thats why I put the board back on the original drive I knew that one was fine Once the board was back on it I checked it and it was working so it went back to being a spare drive The faulty one I opened up and removed the platters from it then ran a magnet all over them to make sure any data on the was totally destroyed then I binned all the pieces I ordered a new HDD from Amazon Why not use my spare drive Well the spare is only 1TB and its around 15 years old I do a lot of video editing and the files can be GB or more in size so it doesnt take many to fill a 1TB HDD up My new HDD arrived yesterday all installed and working in my PC 4TB 35 HDD 5295 not a bad price at all Most are around 80 but this wasnt advertised as a PC HDD but rather a DVR HDD Whats the difference between a PC and a DVR HDD drive basically none its all about marketing the big boys can charge a premium for a PC HDD and people pay it vanity pricing works for them When I say no difference thats not quite true the drive was MBR formatted meaning it has 2x 2GB partitions on it because 2GB is the largest partition size MBR can work with simple to resolve just covert it to GPT in disk management them format it with NTFS and viola a single 4GB partition All up and running again I put the new HDD into my PC booted into the BIOS screen made sure the BIOS was reading the new drive which it was save and exit then reboot PC and its all up and running and working fine Read the full article,0,-0.0461,1

I will be honest guys the Red portrait of king Charles is gorgeous asdfghjkl its a bad portrait Like Objectively It does furbearingbrick blissblissblissbliss chromegnomes milfbro I will be honest guys the Red portrait of king Charles is gorgeous asdfghjkl its a bad portrait Like Objectively It does the opposite of whats intended It looks like the painter is insulting him If it was in a contemporary gallery with no context you would see it immediately as the ambivalent criticism of Charless reign how he fades into the overwhelming red background as a tiny little figure small and insignificant insufficient for the clothes hes wearing It reminds my of Goyas portraits how they were so realistic that they ended up making these great figures look pathetic to the viewer So these are our rulers the sheer novelty the surprise and shock the kinda cunt its serving for no reason I I love it Its an incredible portrait by Jonathan Yeo By the sheer fact that Charles the man is impossible to portray as greater than man because hes just such a nothingburger of a dude So a portrait made to make him look huge and interesting made him be swallowed in red brushstrokes The butterfly that reminded me immediately of we will all laugh at guilded butterflies draws more attention than him It looks like an omen It looks like a warning in all this red Something is not right here This is the best royal portrait ever 1010 This is a painting of a monarch whose individual personality and even bodily presence are a mere footnote within the legacy of bloodshed that built the throne he occupies This is the only way its possible to depict him Its a photograph of his soul And I think all of that is entirely deliberate I think Jonathan Yeo meant this portrait to be absolutely all of those things he just cant be very vocal about the paintings true meaning Yet Ive done this on another post but lets compare that portrait up there to some other portraits Yeos done Heres actor and activist Idris Elba whom colleagues have described as warm and friendly openhearted with an emotional intelligence that makes him capable of being very honest and vulnerable with the character hes playing Heres Jony Ive who founded Apple with Steve Jobs and was chief design officer responsible for some of the more popular artistic choices who recently left the company because the culture had gotten so toxic and shitty He now works more in private design so he has more artistic freedom and he can be less in the public eye Yeos even previously painted British heads of state Heres the phenomenal Baroness Doreen Lawrence of the labour party a Jamaican immigrant who turned the tragic murder of her son into a lifelong campaign of quietly and steadily dismantling systemic racism To me all these portraits are deeply personal conveying the sitters character with empathy and quiet dignity Elba is leaning forward in an intimate friendly gesture He makes eye contact with the viewer but his face is turned slightly to the side inviting but not confrontational his brows slightly drawn together thoughtfully His hands are natural and relaxed Hes shirtless not to be a beefcake thirst trap okay maybe just a tiny little bit but to convey how emotionally naked hes willing to be Ives is literally putting a lens between himself and the viewer we have to look closer to see his face but when we do we see his eyes crinkled with a hint of good humor The perspectives are all distorted but the main thing we see is the hands that have physically built so much of the technology we use And even outside the phone screen hes still enased by a circular frame within a frame indicating yet another layer of separation between the subject and the viewer Lawrence is radiant proudly upright and implacable as a mountain her head held high and her hands folded before her with a selfcontained air of calm determination And even though the background is a chaotic sea of looming shapes and quick brush strokes her eyes keep us grounded even pinned in place Were the viewer but she is studying us And then on the other end of the personality spectrum heres noted asshole Damien Hirst who frequently makes the news for being racist and sexist and just generally a really slimy piece of shit His most famous works are the animal carcasses suspended in resin yeah that That guy Hes made all the money in the goddamn world three times over for pieces like that and he still seems like hes on a personal mission to make everyone around him as miserable as possible Heres Yeos portrait of him seated on a leather throne dick bulge at eye level contained in one of his own tanks Heres the droopy and melancholic portrait of the famously pompous and insufferable John Cooper Clarke selfdescribed original punk poet who was recently booed off stage for making super transphobic remarks and whose most famous quote is I read Kerouac at 12 and decided I could do better And most notably for the argument Im making here heres DDay veteran Sgt Geoffrey Pattinson and see if you can spot the extremely subtle use of color theory here My conclusion Jonathan Yeo paints very good portraits and sometimes his subjects are very bad people And I think he brings absolutely all of his artistic talent to the Charles portrait is absolutely right it is the only possible way to depict him It is a photograph of his soul And thats precisely why its so ugly and uncomfortable to look at People have said that Charles has a complicated legacy which is what people say when someone has an objectively horrible legacy that they are still personally benefiting from But the people who still tolerate his extravagant gilded existence to honor historical tradition will find absolutely nothing to like in this portrait All the gold and brass and pomp of his uniform all the military accolades for his colonial warmongering all the fabulous ostentatious wealth he was born into and has spent every second of his life surrounded by which would have been rendered with glittering precision and care in a traditional royal portrait theyre all dingy and washed out and already fading The medals arent even clearly marked enough to really know what they are its all sound and fury signifying nothing The butterfly that was included as a nod to his honestly extensive conservation work because lets give the little bit of credit where credit is actually due stands out as the one bright point of beauty and authenticity but its dwarfed by the only other visible object the sword and its being swallowed up by that lurid putrid background that seems to seep out of Charles uniform The dark tips of its wings are the most highcontrast part of the painting except for Charles black hollow eyes that stare into nothing And most significantly in my opinion the butterfly isnt actually touching him or connected to him in any way It just exists alongside him but it doesnt need him His face is painted in such a way to detail absolutely every wrinkle without ever being able to completely cover up the blood red background and below the sunken sharklike eyes the artist has included that vapidly pleasant plasteredon smile with nothing behind it that is practically the royal uniform by now I think the angle is also deliberately chosen to be unsettling many portraits are traditionally done either headon ¾ profile or full profile Charles is none of these his head is tilted juuust a few degrees off kilter Its not quite right And hes looking off to the side very slightly his thousandyardstare is kind of drifting over the viewers shoulder He cant look us in the eye And there is no way there is absolutely no possible way that an artist who is smart enough and skilled enough to imbue all his other portraits with so much meaning and symbolism and indicators of the subjects character theres no way thats not intentional But Yeo lives in London Hes still working on other royal and aristocratic portraits He still has to live in that society and he still has to get paid So of course he has to toe the line at least until Charles dies and say that the vivid bloodsoaked red is to symbolize the vibrancy of this terminally ill octogenarian to bring a modern contemporary feel to this 19th century colonizer Yeo knows exactly what hes doing Heres an excerpt about it from Smithsonian magazine The king saw the painting when it was about halfway done Yeo tells BBC News Katie Razzall that Charles was mildly surprised by the strong color but otherwise he seemed to be smiling approvingly He adds that when Camilla saw the portrait she said Yes youve got him Listen I work in memory care and endoflife care and we only say someone seems to be smiling approvingly to comfort the family when someone is so far gone they clearly dont know where they are anymore His exwife Camilla who probably has more good reasons to hate him than any other single human being alive looked at this haunting vision of hell and was like YES PERFECT This is all completely intentional We are all picking up on exactly the message the artist was trying to convey Yeo is trying to tell us loud and clear that something is not right here It is absolutely an omen Op is right it is insulting him And it is supposed to make us look at this pathetic villain who is currently toddling through the final days of his unfairly long and lavishly useless life and think these are our rulers,0,0.9972,1

When your thoughts are not your own We all have our moments when the mind goes blank or we say to ourselves what the hell was I thinking Those are just the everyday occurrences in our world of multitasking nonstop stimulation and too much stress Before cancer I would never let those moments cause much concern But now It concerns me a lot It seems that every step along the treatment path has a cost in terms of mental acuity and clarity Or in other words I feel like Im slowly losing my mind In the first meeting with Deepak my Oncologist he focused in on what I did for a living Lots of questions about decision making critical thinking stuff like that He explained that hormone Testosterone suppression would have a significant impact on the part of my brain that handles executive functioning He was pretty blunt that it might not be possible to mentally function at the high level required by my job It was bad enough that in the same meeting we were also talking about my limited life expectancy but to hear that the treatments would mess with my brain Shit Of course there were several other nasty side effects to consider but that one really got my attention In a classic denial response the idea that I might not be able to do my job was almost more of a concern than being told to get my affairs in order But it was the first line treatment and hopefully the best no way I could wrap my head around chemo at that point way to slow do the progression of the disease So I brushed aside his predictions of functional demise and forged on I made it for almost three years before accepting reality and throwing in the towel on my career The slow erosion of those mental skills that made me so good at what I did spiked as I went through chemo I was falling further and further behind and having a difficult time keeping all the balls in the air In academia there is a time honored tradition of people staying way past their expiration date I decided to not be one of them and closed out things as gracefully and quickly as possible Fast forward to now almost a year later and the erosion process hasnt slowed down There have been more drugs added to my cocktail and the cumulative effects of that chemo brain and time has reduced me to a shadow or so I feel or my former self Friends tell me they dont see any difference on the outside but then again they are friends I wouldnt expect them to be honest why make me feel even worse Pretty sure Im not imagining this Even the effort to write things like this almost makes me break out in a sweat It is so difficult to organize the thoughts Writing was a big part of what I did I was really good at it Now it feels like a form of mental torture It takes so much effort to write anything resembling an articulate thought And then the title of this when your thoughts are not your own Its a daily occurrence I find myself thinking or saying things that are not at all what I mean or believe Prednisone makes me angry and manic Gabapentin makes things foggy Lupron makes me endlessly indecisive Zytiga shit I dont know what the hell thats doing And chemo brain seems stronger than ever almost a year later Sometimes I stop dead in my tracks and listen in disbelief to what is happening inside my head It makes me feel like Im not me anymore,0,0.6416,1

Disconnected from reality Please indulge a short rant So yesterday we had a glorious sunny day with temps in the low 50s I took off on a long walk knowing Id be housebound for a couple days since were having a blizzard today Supposed to get up to 18 of snow But thats not what I want to rant about Im walking down one of our neighborhood streets and there are some enormous puddles because the snow was melting like crazy Some of them spanned the whole street from one side to the other As I approached one of these small ponds a car was heading towards me I moved off to the side as far from the water as I could get fully expecting the car to slow down Im looking directly at the driver and she never even registered the water hitting it at fullspeed A tsunami of muddy water washes over me Were talking soaked from head to toe I turn to yell and obscenely gesture expecting the car to have slowed down and its speeding off as if nothing happened As Im standing there trying to squeegee the water and mud off of myself wait for it another car comes zooming along SPLASH Good thing I was on the back side of my morning Prednisone dose or I would have turned into a psychotic maniac But this time the driver stopped and apologized even offering me some paper towels But it just blows me away that people can be so disconnected distracted from their surroundings How could you not see what was going to happen Sigh The rest of the walk was uneventful,1,-0.5347,1

Labs In addition to the usual suite of monthly labs a few more were added this time around This morning they took so many tubes that my arm was going numb The results were a mixed bag My primary marker moved up again along with some other important CMP numbers Trying to keep the words of my Oncology NP front and center She said they the numbers are going to move around and that I have to expect things like this to happen She also told me to NOT FREAK OUT Trying But my lipid profile was quite good so at least all the drugs havent screwed that up The reason labs have become so stressful is the length of time approaching a year Ive been on Zytiga Thats the drug that is keeping things under control right now Its a given that eventually the cancer will mutate and circumvent it and then I will be down to one last androgen suppression drug to try After that its back to chemo Zytiga is so new that there isnt a lot of long term usage data Initially they told me it could work anywhere from a few months to two or three years But with such aggressive disease Ive burned through other drugs at an alarming rate So of course any upward movement makes we worry that its about to stop working Fear Its about the future Right now I am ok Just need to keep focused on whats in front of me right here right now Tomorrow Im getting on a plane and heading to Florida Time for a much needed escape and time with friends,1,-0.6046,1

Scar Tissue anotheronewiththecancer It is possible Id become less anxious about mammograms now that Im 3 ½ years out from diagnosis Ive said a few times on this blog that Ill never be over cancerthat fear of recurrence will always be with me I know I am not the only person who thinks like that That great Slate article published last year quoted Dana Jennings Even though my health keeps improving and theres a good chance that Im cancer free I still feel stalked as if the cancer were perched on my shoulder like some unrepentant imp Read More From my friend Wendi Living postcancer can be just as stressful as going through treatment Its not something that gets talked about a lot Youre supposed to get cured and then go along your merry way Or at least thats the pablum society pushes on us But the truth is far different,0,0.7251,1
The joy of air travel So Im sitting on the plane in SRQ boarding is complete were ready to push back from the gate and then there is a commotion up front The life raftemergency slide for the front door has just deployed itself into the cabin I shit you not The pilots are trapped in the cockpit and the flight attendants have no way to deflate this thing Luckily none of them were standing there when it let fly Im sure it would have caused some serious injuries We had to wait for a maintenance mechanic to arrive that could deflate it so everyone could get off because now the plane is no longer flight worthy A packed flight I think people now need to be rebooked and guess what its the end of spring break and all flights are full I was looking at Monday or Tuesday before I could get out Normally I would have been like cool back to Stevens house but Monday is an Oncology exam along with Lupron and I didnt want to try and reschedule all that A little quick thinking on my feet along with the Delta app on my phone got me on a flight tomorrow morning out of Tampa With a taxi voucher in hand mind you it was an hour and a half cab ride I headed to my Aunt and Uncles for the night What a day Keeping my fingers crossed for a little smoother trip in the morning,0,0.8135,1

Lupron smackdown Monday was my 15th Lupron injection just like clockwork every 90 days The brain wasnt designed to operate correctly without all of its hormones in my case testosterone Ive now had mine turned off since August of Even after all this time I still underestimate the impact of those injections Mondays fucked me up good No other way to say it Im just starting to feel like Im back in control again To everyone who has expressed concern about my cryptic going dark message thank you and Im sorry Returning from my travels to the reality of an oncology exam combined with Lupron was a bit more than I was prepared to handle Suddenly the blog my life the disease it was all too much and I just wanted to bolt I still feel that lurking in the corners of my mind but its back to a manageable level There is no user guide for doing this thing called living with stage VI disease Its pretty much a fly by the seat of your pants kind of life Sometimes it goes relatively smoothly and sometimes it dont,0,0.431,1
