terminal,"I was diagnosed with terminal cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma 18 years ago. We sought out the world’s leading specialist in the disease and he saved my life. I had surgery to remove my lung , had heated chemo during surgery, had 4 sessions of chemo and 30 sessions of radiation . and it worked. They told me I had 15 months to live. I always say survivorship is a shitshow. it certainly isn’t what I expected, but I am forever grateful to still be here, even with all of the lasting issues due to my surgery and treatment . Someone told me that gratitude and grief can exist in the same place at the same time, and that really helped me to sort through all of the emotions that come with surviving cancer… I just wanted to celebrate with others who understand …",reddit
terminal,"As the title says, I think it's time. I (48m) have terminal carcinoma with unidentified origin. It began in July with the severe night sweats. It took till October to get my cancer diagnosis while my family doctor ran every test under the sun. In October I checked myself into a hospital that was willing to CT and biopsy me right away. My oncologist can only narrow it down to head and neck type. With zero chance of cure. I have 5 tumors and a few of them are over 12cm with 2 growing thru my abdomen wall. Two more in my chest that have made my right arm useless and painful and the left painful to say down or sit. Most of my lymph nodes in my body are cancerous and the ones between my lungs are pressing on my esophagus and lungs. The ones in my neck just keep growing and it's hard to swallow. I've done chemo 5 times weeks apart for the most part except for my last session which I delayed it for 6 weeks because I just couldn't face it again so soon. When I do chemo it takes me two weeks or longer for the side effects to wear off and then in a few days I have to do it all over again. My side effects are extremely painful. It's 3 different types of chemo along with immunotherapy. For 4 days after I can't eat. I can barely drink fluids. for at least a week I can't even get up. I consider it my own living hell. I just don't to suffer with it any longer. My next chemo session is scheduled for tomorrow. I just can't face it again. I'm getting so thin that my legs barely work to walk. my right arm has become pretty much useless as the muscles have been eaten away so much i can't hold up a plate of food and when I flex my bicep I don't feel any of it left. Just a blank spot where it used to be. I'm in great pain all the time with my tumors leaning on my nerves and making parts of my body numb along with never ending pins and needles which itself is quite painful. I have barely the strength to even take a shit. I'm forced to pee in the urine container from a sitting position because I can't even lift myself from the couch or bed to stand without help. I sleep 14 hours a day waking up to eat or use the bathroom. I have a couple hours a day where I can sit and talk or watch tv. My wife works 10 hours a day 4 days a week and I don't have much help on those days even with her working from home. She has to stay accountable at work and if she gets fired her life would be ruined too. I fear if i live much longer I will be a vegetable eating and shitting thru tubes. To me that is not being alive. And it's not something I want to go thru. Nor do I want my wife to have to care for a vegetable. I'm sharing this here because frankly besides my wife I have no one to talk about it with. She's an amazing woman who has stuck with me thru this and done anything and everything she can to help me thru this part of life. I guess I just want to hear I'm making the right choice. That I'm not letting her down by not fighting longer. That It's okay to Not want to be a vegetable. Because I feel like I am failing and letting her down. But I think not taking this option would lead to far worse. I'm 48. I feel like I'm leaving her early in life and that I am letting her down so badly by dying. It's a strange but strong emotion of guilt. ​ ​ *Edit* Thank you all for the supportive responses I have received. It's way more than I ever expected. Love to you all. And just as a side note I sat down with my wife and had a long talk about this before making my decision as to be well informed and all options weighed. The hardest decision I've ever made, but I am confident and comfortable that I'm making the right choice. In my own usual dark joking words ""I drove this meat wagon till the wheels came off. And now I will sit in the yard till the grass takes over me""",reddit
terminal,"Hi community. I have an 11 year old son, Andreas, that has AT/RT brain cancer. He was diagnosed in late May . Since then he has received around chemotherapy doses (initially the primary AT/RT protocol treatment, then the medulloblastoma ""MEMMAT"" protocol treatment, over 70 radiation therapies to his brain and spine, undergone several surgeries to remove tumors, and countless MRI scans. The initial surgery in which removed the primary tumor, made his left hand and leg semi-paralyzed (spastic) and his right eye non-functional (the pupil is always dilated and the movement is not coordinated with the other eye. ​ During the last three years we've received the ""he's not gonna make it past the next months-message several times. And Andreas fought back. Each time. Metastasis in the spine? Radiation therapy. Metastasis in the brain? MEMMAT protocol with chemotherapy doses administered on average 2.5 times per week for over a year. More tumors in the brain? More radiation therapy, last time was in April . ​ Unfortunately, even though he's been through hell and back, the cancer still grows. At least 10 tumors spread around the brain is now growing. He's starting to lose his ability to speak and swallow, due to a large tumor growing in the cerebellum. We have started with a fairly experimental drug called Tazverik, but the odds are so heavily against him and he is tired. He is currently trying to make peace with the fact that he is going to die very soon and he is saying his last goodbyes to friends and family. ​ In April , when we received one of the ""you're not gonna make it-messages from the doctors, a childhood friend of mine (Lasse) who's a great musician, wrote a song to Andreas called ""Main man"" and recorded this with his band ""Few Dollars More. This song has meant the world to Andreas. We listen to it several times a day and it gives us a mix of serenity, peace, melancholy and sorrow. Andreas finds great comfort in knowing that he actually has a song that the world will remember him by. He has requested me to ""write to Reddit"" and ask if they can listen to the song, because it is so important to him to let the world know that this song exists. All profits made from playbacks on Spotify/Tidal/Youtube goes to the The Norwegian Childhood Cancer Organization, so there are no individual profiting from this. Andreas just wants the song to be played for him these last weeks. ​ I am asking ""Reddit"" to visit Youtube and listen to his song. I am posting this in several subreddits and I am sorry if I'm breaking the rules of the subreddit you read this in by asking for views and likes, but right now I've got nothing to lose. ​ Links in comments EDIT - thank you so much for all the wonderful comments and awards and whatnot. I’ve read all the beautiful comments and PM’s I’ve received to him, and he wanted to say thank you to the Reddit community: It’s in Norwegian but he’s saying: “Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I really appreciated. thanks for all the nice things you wrote to me. That made me happy” ​ EDIT 2 - Andreas loves to hear all your thoughts and comments. He really appreciates them. Thank you all of you. This has been a very good day for him, and each and every one of you have contributed to that. I asked him if he wanted to say something more. He wanted to do that (English translation in the description field on the YT video:",reddit
terminal,"Hi everyone, last week my grandmother (78) was diagnosed with nsclc, we thought we caught it early due to lack of symptoms, her main symptoms being fatigue and stomach pain. ( No cough, no breathlessness etc. However we got the unfortunate news that it was stage 4(a) and “incurable. I am utterly heartbroken it has got to this stage and right now I don’t really know what to expect. She only has one kidney as she donated the other to save my uncles life nearly 9 years ago and because of this I am worried it will effect her treatment. For her age she is healthy despite the cancer and this is partly why it’s came as a huge shock to us. She is also a non smoker. If there is anybody in here that could give me any sort of hope that treatment can prolong her life, or any sucess stories please share as I would be grateful. Wishing everyone the best and prayers️",reddit
terminal,"Hey, I was diagnosed with a a rare ovarian cancer at 24 years old and have been dealing with this for over 5 years now. I have been with my now husband for 3 years and I am fortunate that when I was told I was terminal 7 weeks ago, instead of running away, he married me and we have now been married 6 weeks. (Planned a wedding in 9 days, it was a lot of fun) I don't know how long I have left due to the nature of the cancer but I am doing palliative chemo and procedures to keep me going. Its my husband's birthday in 3 weeks and I know this will be the last one with him so I need to get him a gift that will hopefully last longer than me (sorry ) I'm pretty bad at gift giving under normal circumstances so I really could use some help with this. His favourites things are; cars, motorbikes, the colour red, maritime history, movies/cinema/dvd collecting, videogames, vinyl collecting and horology. He has specifically told me to not buy him a watch because he has too many of them. I recently took up knitting and I'm knitting him a pillow that will have a voice recording in it telling him I love him but I know that won't last forever. Any gift suggestions would be really helpful! Budget is around £ but can go more depending on the gift. I have also booked us a weekend away for his birthday which I'm hoping doesn't get wrecked by chemo. TLDR; Been dealing with a rare cancer for 5 years, found out I was terminal 7 weeks ago. Need a special gift suggestion for my husband's birthday in 3 weeks.",reddit

terminal,"I have cervical cancer with metastasis to my lungs (just 5 small nodules. When I found out how small and few my lung nodules were I was delighted, it explained why I was so well physically, and reassured me that I wasn't at death's door or anything. I know I'm terminal but because I'm basically fine physically I felt I was 'living with a terminal illness' rather than actively dying. Today I had a phonecall following my routine 3-month scans (about a week ago) from my oncology nurse telling me I had cancer in my spine. It was an absolute shock. I asked if I was going to become paralysed and to my shock she just said, yes. We can try to postpone it with a 'single section' radiotherapy (which I'm having on Friday. It was the one thing I never considered. I thought my lung nodules would probably get worse and I would go down the lung cancer path. The next location my type of cancer usually spreads to is the liver, and my liver is still fine. The possibility of it spreading to my spine was never even considered. Suddenly one phonecall and I'm going to become paralysed before I die, maybe even quite soon. Having a panic - my home isn't wheelchair friendly, and I live with my elderly mother.I look after her, she can't look after me. And who will look after her? How will it happen, will I gradually lose sensation, or function, how does it happen? I feel lost. It's a shock out of the blue. It was lung cancer I was mentally prepared for. That's all, I suppose.",reddit
terminal,"Hello - My grandmother was diagnosed just this week with stage 4 lung cancer. The mass is over 7 cm in the right lung. It has completely cut off the right lung. The pulmonologist doesn't recommend surgery as it has spread in many places. So far we have found mets in the spine pelvis brain adrenal glands and a large mass in the liver. The oncologist did not recommend radiation for the brain mets. They took a biopsy of the liver and sent us home awaiting the results. She was independent up until this point. Luckily she already lives with me and my husband. But now she needs assistance standing, walking, going to the bathroom, cooking her meals, doing laundry etc. She is flipping back and forth between understanding how serious her condition is and insisting that she has to do things alone to recover. She is definitely too weak to handle what I understand chemo would be for her. I know we won't know what can be done until the biopsy results but the appointment is in three weeks and the initial estimate for her is only living weeks. I guess I am just looking for what to expect and how to help her understand what's happening.",reddit
terminal,"Hi all! I know that when diagnosed with cancer, stories about survival can be helpful. It’s been many years since I posted to Reddit or even looked at it. But years ago I did an AMA about my diagnosis with terminal cancer. I had been given two years to live (approximately. I have had numerous surgeries, have done 7 or 8 chemos, but 11 years later, I am still here. I was diagnosed with breast cancer that spread to liver and lungs. It is HER2, one of the more rare and deadly forms. However, that turned out to be a good thing, as a year or so after diagnosis they started to do research and came out with anti-HER2+ drugs. Not everybody responds, but I did. I still go to chemo and have many of the problems that come with that. I’m not healthy, but I’m still here. I went from having a 12 year old who I merely wanted to see graduate HS, to watching him graduate from Caltech and get a good job in tech. I saw my oldest, who was 22, also get a good job, married a wonderful woman and then have children. My hair is grey, and I’m getting old (Although I still look pretty young. I’ve lived a pretty good life and got many years that others didn’t. I’m grateful but think about my friends who died every day. But it’s starting to change, progress is being made and others will get those years too. The point is, hang in there. Do your treatments. You never know what can happen, and what’s around the corner. My nurses call me a miracle. I don’t believe in miracles, but I was at the right place at the right time. And I never wrote myself out. You can do that too. Good luck to all of you!",reddit
terminal,"Hello, We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have. Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help. Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet. Link: As a thank you for your time, we will enter you into a prize draw where you could win a £50 Amazon voucher, or even an iPad Mini. Thank you, Rosie This study is a collaboration between researchers at the University of Chester, University of Edinburgh, University of Sydney, McGill University and CanTeen. The Principal Investigator is Prof Nick Hulbert-Williams at the University of Chester.",reddit
terminal,"Hi all, I'm looking for some advice if anyone's able to give it - I appreciated that might not be possible. My step dad was diagnosed with lung cancer a year ago - he'd had throat cancer a few years ago too. He responded to chemo really well: one tumor disappeared and two others shrunk. He stopped chemo for a few months and was having radiotherapy. Test results came back in Jan and the cancer has already spread to his bones (in very little time, maybe three months or so. We were very shocked as he seemed to be getting better with the chemo. He's got a lot of pain in his hip, but will be having radiotherapy to manage this. He's having weekly chemo again. It's really hard to get information from my mum and him: they are not wanting to acknowledge things and fluctuate from optimism, to being very closed. I've obviously googled things (I know, I know) and the prognosis looks very scary. I want more information from them, but really don't want to push them too much. I'm scared that they are avoiding things and that this will make things harder in the long term (not getting to see people until things are very critical etc. I've tried to ask my mum about the prognosis and stage etc, but she said she hasn't asked. She said they know it's terminal, but don't want to know more. My question is have others experienced this and what advice do you have? What questions can I ask that would be helpful? What information do you wish you knew? Are there medical things that it'd be helpful for me to know if they want to speak? My other question, which I appreciate is almost impossible to answer, is what should I expect? Is he likely to die in the next year, or less, or longer? Please feel that you can be blunt and honest.

As most of us know, receiving this diagnosis for a parent is heartbreaking and you feel so helpless. My mother showed no symptoms apart from pain in her right arm, upon which the doctor detected a lump in her neck and ran a biopsy. This confirmed the unfortunate - she had stage 3 lung adenocarcinoma (non small cell) which had spread to lymph nodes in her neck. Weirdly, she is 48, active and healthy, and has never touched alcohol or cigarettes in her life. But we know lung cancer does not discriminate. She was administered a chemo session while we awaited her gene results and was then put on Lorlatinib (ALK. She showed considerable improvement in her PET scan (attached below) that was done after 4 months of being on this medicine. She is now due for her next scan this month. I'm an anxious person myself and it has been so difficult to come to terms with this but am really just wondering and researching the internet all the time. Is there hope? Will she see me get married? My younger brother get a job? Is there a world where her NSCLC diagnosis becomes a chronic illness instead of a terminal one?

But also my treatment triggered early menopause and I'm on HRT.

Then last night I had a dream where the cancer was back and progressed to terminal and I was dying and it really freaked me out. I started back at work earlier this year and called in sick today and I'm worried my manager is getting annoyed. Everything just feels so hard. I'm already in therapy and I don't want to go on antidepressants. I feel like there's nothing that helps.

terminal,"My Story: A Journey Through Cancer In , my life was irrevocably changed when I lost my wife to triple-negative breast cancer—a relentless, aggressive form of the disease that claimed her life far too soon. Watching her fight with every ounce of her strength for two years was both heartbreaking and inspiring. She faced her diagnosis with courage and determination, enduring countless treatments and surgeries, but ultimately, the cancer won. Losing her left a deep void in my life, a wound that I didn’t think would heal. Little did I know, I was about to face my own battle with cancer. In , just a few years after my wife’s passing, I was diagnosed with Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT—a rare and extremely aggressive form of cancer primarily affecting my lymph nodes in the head and neck area. DSRCT is a cancer that very few people know about, and even fewer survive. It is relentless, much like the cancer that took my wife. My diagnosis came with the harsh reality that my cancer is terminal. Since then, I’ve been undergoing a grueling chemotherapy regimen called VDC/IE—one of the most aggressive combinations of drugs used for rare cancers like mine. The chemotherapy has slowed the disease in some areas, but my condition remains unstable. Every day is a battle against the severe side effects of both the cancer and the treatment. The pain is constant, and my body feels like it’s breaking down under the weight of the chemotherapy. My energy levels are at an all-time low, and simple tasks feel monumental. In recent months, I’ve started to experience new symptoms that have only deepened the uncertainty: tightness in my chest, headaches, and night sweats. The pain radiates from my neck down to my chest, a constant reminder that the cancer is spreading. At times, even swallowing is difficult. These symptoms are debilitating and have made me wonder how much time I truly have left. The physical toll has been severe, but the emotional toll has been equally overwhelming. I had to leave work early in my diagnosis due to the rapid progression of the disease, losing the sense of purpose I once had. The activities that used to bring me joy—like cooking or simply enjoying the small pleasures of life—now feel like distant memories. Each day blurs into the next, with meals becoming the most significant part of my routine. The highlight of my day is often just the taste of something comforting, as much of what I once loved has lost its meaning. My wife’s passing left me grappling with grief, and now I’m facing my own mortality in ways I never imagined. It’s hard not to feel as though the cancer journey that took her life is repeating itself with me. There’s a sense of cruel irony in watching her go through what I am now living. Yet, I’ve had to come to terms with the fact that, like her, I have little control over what happens next. It’s a difficult reality to accept, but I’ve learned to face it head-on, with the same resilience she showed. Despite everything, I don’t live in fear of what’s to come. After watching my wife’s strength and having faced the worst of it myself, I’ve developed a kind of acceptance. Life is fleeting and unpredictable. Cancer has taken so much from me—my wife, my health, and my future—but I refuse to let it take my spirit. I’ve accepted that my journey is nearing its end, but I also know that I’ve lived, loved, and fought, even when it felt impossible. This story is not about seeking sympathy, but about sharing the reality of what it’s like to live with cancer after already losing someone to it. It’s a brutal journey that tests everything you are, but it also teaches you to appreciate what little time and comfort you have left. My wife fought valiantly, and now I do the same—every day, every moment, until I can no longer fight. Cancer has shaped my life, for better or worse. But I’ve come to terms with the fact that I can only take each day as it comes. My journey is one of loss, endurance, and ultimately, acceptance.",reddit

He works 7 days a week and can’t quit due to living expenses. I feel so sad for him. He can’t even cope with his feelings and can only focus on working to pay bills. I was wondering if anyone else has had experiences with this kind of thing. The doctor has helped him apply for emergency disability but It will take him months or more to get approved/denied. Is there a charity or place he can go for help with this? He shouldn’t have to spend the last few months of his life working. I’m so disappointed in the American system right now.

So at the beginning of this year (literally Jan 8th) I 24f was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. The first oncologist said to put me on hospice since I was showing end of life stages but the local oncologist (my current) suggested genetic testing where we found out I have lynch syndrome. So the good news I was treatable with immunotherapy but bad new I'd have to worry about 6 or 7 different cancers for the rest of my life and passing it on to children since it's genetic. I recovered from my feeble state fast and got massive results fast. By the 6 month mark I had a 50% and 40% shrinkage in my tumors (liver and colon) but I felt like an imposter in the cancer community because I ""got it easy. But in July the blessing turned into a curse of sorts and I had perforated my bowls because my tumor was shrinking so fast (doc said she'd never seen any tumor shrink this fast. I didn't show symptoms till I was severely septic and needed emergency surgery to get my colostomy which has been very difficult to adjust to (I have a phobia of fecal matter) and I feel like I have no one other than my boyfriend to lean on. I feel bad because he has had to be my main support through all this. Dont get me wrong im extremely greatful for him I mean we were together for 2 months when I got diagnosed and chose to stay (really cute note I told him I might lose my fertility and he said theres a lot of options but him leaving wasnt one of them.

terminal,"Hi all Today was the day I found out I am going to die of cancer. I knew I had the disease before, I also knew it had spread from my oesophagus to my lung and I was aware that I was in a sticky situation in the first place but I'd been holding out hope that they'd find a surgeon willing to do the operation I need to survive. All my referrals are done. No one will do it. I have cancer that surgery can't cure. It could be 6 months, it could be 5 years. However long it is, I'm going to die. Fuck. I've subbed and added this place to my favourites, if anyone wants to chat then I'll be all ears.",reddit
terminal,"I (m28) have a terminal high grade sarcoma, highly aggressive, spread to bones and lungs and other organs (even tho chemo got my lungs free, but my time is limited. I probably will never get married, build a house, plant a tree or have children. Even if it could be physically possible to have children after chemo and radiation, it would not be fair to throw them into a world without a father. And this just sucks, my sister is infertile and the family line will end with us two. The most time I'm aware of these facts and can handle them, but sometimes I just break down and sink into the darkness of these thoughts. They overwhelm me and I can't do anything about it. Who knows if I even get to know someone new who could handle my cancer and that I'm going to die. Who would get into a relationship with a terminal ill wreck.

terminal,"*UPDATE* I have just had a meeting with my oncologist to discuss the biopsy results of my colonoscopy. It is now truly confirmed to be exactly what they had informed me it was likely to be. However, they have also informed me that the genomic testing of the biopsy has revealed what sub set it is. Which sadly is quite an aggressive type. My initial time frame (given very roughly with no certainty) was around years providing treatment is successful. Well, it has now been changed to 2 years maximum providing treatment goes perfectly. More like to be months. Thanks for all the kind words and responses from everyone. * Hi Everyone, ​ I am a 32 yr old male that is reasonably fit, reasonably healthy, and have had absolutely no symptons before. ​ I have just had my diagnosis of Advanced Metastatic Colon Cancer. ​ It started low in my colon and has spread to a destructive lesion in my pubic bone, 8 growths in my liver, 3 on my left kidney and many many smaller growths in my lymph nodes. ​ The point of making this post is just to get it off my chest to people that have either experienced it, or have family members that have. Without being a damn Doctor, of which I have had far more than enough of in the last 2 weeks. ​ Here is my story. ​ About a month ago I started getting pain in my left hip, I went to see my local GP who gave me anti inflammatories and asked me to report back in a week. ​ A week later it had gotten worse rather than improved, so he referred me over to get an xray and an ultrasound done of the area. They came back inconclusive. ​ The next step was an MRI of the area, which did happily reveal that the prognosis he had suggested was correct (a labral tear on the femur) however it also incidentally found a destructive lesion in the pubic bone. ​ This set off a whirlwind of blood tests and other test after a second opinion (my partner is an oncologist who forwarded the results to her consultant to get her opinion. The testing required was a full blood work up with cancer markers included as well as a full body CT scan. ​ The blood work came back as completely normal except for my CA cancer marker, normal is less than 40, mine returned with a result of . ​ The CT scan revealed multiple growth in different areas, confirming that it had spread and that I would need a PET scan to get more definitive answers. ​ I was then fast tracked through the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre which is where my partner is currently working. They organised a PET scan to happen within a few days. I was also allowed to see the results about 10 minutes after the scan was concluded. ​ I was lit up like a christmas tree showing all the growths. ​ I have since spent 5 days in hospital in a pain crisis due to the lesion in my pubic bone having weakened the bone enough for it to fracture. (which just btw, seriously sucks) Whilst I was in the hospital they have also now done a Colonoscopy to get tissue samples of the Primary tumour in my colon. ​ Currently that is all I know, but the conversation with my oncologist have confirmed this to be a terminal case, and that systemic treatment is the only option, which will only allow a small extension of life. ​ I hate it all, my life was finally going in the right direction, I am successfully running a small business with one of my younger brothers. We are just about finishing our second full financial year and are expected to hit out first major milestone of k turnover. ​ I was also intending to ask my partner to marry me in a few months. ​ We were looking at houses to buy, and are working on our first child (she has reproductive issues, so we are pursuing IVF. Everything seemed to be going so well, I guess I can't be too surprised that the universe decided to slap me back down to reality. ​ Well, that's all I have to say right now, I just wanted to hear some other peoples opinions on everything, and to maybe get a little support in this ridiculous time of my life. ​ Cheers",reddit
terminal,"I had to put my cat down today. What we’d thought was arthritis turned out to be osteosarcoma, and by the time the vet realized *that, it had spread too far. When he broke the news, the vet gave a hard sale on how the cat would have no quality of life and would be in immense pain for however longer he lived, and said the most humane thing to do was to put him down. I stood there and took it in, not saying anything about my own diagnosis—pancreatic adenocarcinoma, for sure spread to my lungs and I’ll be shocked if it’s not also in my stomach or liver too by now—and agreed with him. And as the shot did its work my cat put his paw on my fingers like he always did and closed his eyes for the last time. And as sad as I was, I also felt jealous for just a moment that they’ll let you put a *pet* to sleep if they’re sick enough, but a terminal patient choosing to leave on their own terms is de facto illegal and if anyone ever catches you trying they’ll *keep you alive* out of spite. (They’ll also *tell* you how much your cat’s vet bill is going to be, but they’ll never tell *you* how much *your* treatment costs) And then I had to race across town to pick my kid up from school because my Spouse changed their mind and said they’d rather not. Because I don’t even get to have that option even if it were legal, because I’m the only one who gives a shit that anyone else in my family eats or bathes. And yes, I know I just posted about a damn cat’s cancer. I am aware of that. More than one type of mammal is allowed to have cancer. Cancer patients are allowed to have pets. If any of that is something you want to report me for, go ahead and do that and block me as well. I have no idea how much longer I have left before I’ll have to stop working. I have no idea how long before some growth in me finally squeezes an artery shut or bursts one open, or a coughing fit lasts so long I end up passing out. Maybe I’ll be lucky and die in my sleep before the pain *really* sets in. Maybe I’ll get really lucky and I’ll die on a day my Spouse is actually home so my son won’t starve for however long it takes Spouse to get back from fucking their latest hook-up. I forget if there’s a point to this. I don’t care. I killed my cat today and it doesn’t fucking matter and nobody gives a damn and now I have to make up all the work I missed today because I was off killing my cat.",reddit

I have read your struggles. They have impacted me greatly. To the newly diagnosed; these folks in here are great resource! The help is priceless. Be your own advocate and remember, any drx promising you something you cannot confirm via other sources are just being cavalier in their message/treatment. Try other sources and challenge them on their statements. You just might be amazed how choices become clearer as you get an education in something you never wanted to learn about! Kudo's to the supporters! Children/spouses/SO's, etc.without you we are nothing! I can't imagine going through this alone. I KNOW some of you are. I don't know how you do it.

terminal,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my thoughts and ask for guidance on how to navigate my current situation. Thought thats a good thread for since, since all of us there have to deal with live changing illness. Recently, I was diagnosed with a rare tumor—a paraganglioma at the base of my skull. While it’s not life-threatening, its location is extremely delicate. The only option is surgery, but due to the sensitive anatomical structures involved, the tumor won’t be entirely removed. This means I’ll have to live with it, knowing it’s still there, which is unsettling. Additionally, the operation will damage some of my nerves, leading to facial paralysis on one side, difficulty speaking, and trouble swallowing. On top of that, I’ve already lost hearing in one ear over the past few months, replaced by a relentless, screaming tinnitus that makes sleep nearly impossible. Funny thing is that, I can't even get a cochelar implant because I wouldn't be able to control the remains of the tumor with MRI due to magnets in implants. I just don’t know how to live with all of this. I’m only 23. My life was just beginning to take shape. I finished my studies, moved out, and found quite recently a great job. Now, I struggle to even get out of bed. Mornings are the worst because for a brief moment, I hope it was all just a bad dream until my tinnitus reminds me that this is my new reality. Eating and drinking feel like a challenge, and most days, all I can do is cry into my pillow, smoke, and pray for it all to end. Lately, I’ve even started having suicidal thoughts. I know that my struggle isn’t the same as those with terminal cancer, but for me, this feels unbearable, especially at such a young age. Doctors were trying to cure me from having an ear infection for over 2 months, when suddenly at one day I found out that I have a tumor the size of a tennis ball inside my head. Can anyone tell me how to live with this? How to deal with life altering permament damages to my body? How do I change my way of thinking to feel close to normal again?

I have a large primary tumour in the sigmoid colon and mets to the liver (80% is tumour/necrotic, lungs and all through my lymph nodes so surgery is not an option. My heart is also dysfunctional, apparently due to being anaemic for so long and my body over-compromising. Apparently my particular mutation means fewer treatment options.

I keep asking different people on my treatment team about my prognosis and I’ve never had a sunnier outcome than 2 years. This includes 3 different oncology opinions on my paperwork to access my TPD/life insurance. My question is; why is some stage 4 cancer terminal and some curable? Is it whether surgery is possible?

terminal,"I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer about 1.5 years ago. Stage four because it had migrated from my esophagus to my left lung. I was given treatment that was palliative in nature.

I was so sick that I signed up for assisted dying. They cut back the dose to 50% and it became barely tolerable. I was then found to be a good candidate for Herceptin treatments. It worked so well that the cancer disappeared from my stomach and esophagus. The cancer on my lung was shrinking. But, the cancer mutated and started growing again.

She also has a mix of nodes, masses, and lesions on her esophagus (1, I believe, stomach (1, I believe, large upper lung lobe tumor that went from 4x5 cm to almost 10x10cm in 3 to 4 months.

terminal,I was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma back in March of when I was 28 years old. I had a large mole on my back about the size of a quarter and it was starting to change shape and darken in color. So at the time I was in prison in Missouri so didnt really have choices when it came to treatment s. The mole was checked out by the prisons doctor and he decided against a partial biopsy and went ahead and cut it all out right there in the prison. The mole was sent out to the states pathologist and the results came back positive for Melanoma. So the doctor at the prison didnt really know much about Melanoma i am guessing because when he brought me in to give me the results he attempted to stage the Melanoma and told me it would be advanced stage 4 Melanoma and they he will be contacting the states oncologist for treatment options. NEEDLESS to say i went back to my cell and cried lol im tough and im not ashamed to say i cried. Well when that was all out of me i got on the phone home to let me my mom in on the news and try to get some info on what Melanoma was or what i was really up against. So god bless my mom she did her best to make me feel like it wasnt to serious and I was just ad worried about her as she was me but after some research I found out that Stage 4 would be terminal. So now all i know is i am dying without ever have feeling sick. So the states oncologist recommends i have a lymph node biopsy done. So they injected some radioactive dye at the site of the mole that wad removed and hooked me up to a machine where it could see the dye flow threw my body and to which lymph nodes the cancer most likely spread to if it had in fact spread at all. So with me the dye came to rest with 2 different lymph node sites both being under each arm in the arm pit area. So then a biopsy was done of both lymph node sites and sent off for testing. When the results came back the lymph nodes under my left arm all came back negative while the lymph nodes on my right side came back positive for melanoma. So now I am officially staged at stage 3 and now im really scared to death. I never knew this was spreading threw my body slowly gaining a foothold for an attack that would certainly be sooner then later. So the state recommended that all the lymph nodes under my right arm be removed in case of further spread. After all the lymph nodea were removed and tested they all came back negative and a blessing it was to me. So now i am technically cancer free they say and need to start with these scans every 3 months or so for the next 5 years. The state ordered PET-CT Scans which is the most accurate and expensive scans for my condition and the first one comes back negative. BLESSING. Second comes back negative. BLESSING. Third comes back negative. BLESSING. Now about this time I am released from prison and no longer have insurance provided to me threw the state. So i go to TMC and apply for insurance and get my medical records from the prison and to the people who need them. So now I am due for my 4th PET-CT Scan and believe it or not I am not able to get this scan because it coats way to much and the free insurance i receive threw the hospital wont provide this type of scan for me. Believe it or not but I was provided with better medical treatment and care while I was in prison than while I am out So have to settle for a CT Scan. Well the first CT scan shows some objects of interest and I am following up with that as i type this here now. What i have noticed is under my right arm where my lymph nodes have been removed is a small pea size growth that is right under the surface of the skin. Where it is clearly visible from across the room if i just lift up my arm. So the doctor here ordered a sonogram and I guess they dont like what they saw cuz im meeting with the surgeon today to setup for a biopsy of the weird growth.

terminal,"I'll be 31 in two weeks (happy frickin birthday me, and I've been fighting cancer for just over 3 years. I inherited it from my mom, and it started in my colon/rectum and then it was in my liver and now lungs. I followed all the instructions, did all the treatments, but my doctor told me last week I have another year or two left. This whole week has been a constant assault on my mental health. I'm terrified, like, absolutely scared out of my mind. During the day I can distract myself with activities and talking to friends, but at night? I can't sleep, I can't turn off my brain, I have panic attacks. I'm just so exhausted. Every little cough or anything feeling that's out of the normal terrifies me and reminds me that this isn't just a bad dream. I don't want to die. I'm too young! I just finished baking school before my diagnosis, I landed an awesome job at a doughnut shop that pays and treated me like a human being. Life was looking good for once. I wanted to fall in love, get married, buy a house, have a kid, go on vacation, have anniversaries, grow old. The only thing I'm thankful for is that this is happening to me and not my brother who already has his life together with a loving wife and their own place. If one of us had to inherent this disease, I'm glad it was me. But I really just want to live. So badly. I'd do anything to grow old.",reddit
terminal,"Hi I’ve been following this group but haven’t posted much. I have terminal breast cancer with lung metastasis, amongst other things. My lungs are really affected at the moment, filling up with fluid. I can barely do anything cause I get breathless. My oxygen requirements have been increasing during the last week. I’m in hospital. I’m really scared of dying, the moment of being unable to breathe when the doctor can’t do anything about it. Do you have some experiences or positive thoughts that may help? Normally I wouldn’t care about dying young, it’s just the suffering that terrifies me at the moment. I can’t even fall asleep. Thank you",reddit
terminal,"I have stage 4 lung cancer. I have 3 teen children. The oldest is 19, youngest is 14. I'm thinking of ending things before it gets too bad. The problem is I don't want to go too soon but I don't want it to be too late either. I don't want my kids to see me get emaciated. I don't want them or my husband responsible for my every function. I can't stand the thought of them seeing me like that. I want them to remember me happy and healthy (as healthy as I can be now) Right now im on oxygen almost constantly. I can't still do most tasks but for the most part I can't clean much anymore. Even cooking makes me tired now. I can tell I'm declining despite my scans showing miniscule improvement. I'm on my third line of treatment, meaning I'm running out of viable treatment options. My state unfortunately hasn't legalized the assistance of death for terminal patients. I'd have to do it myself. I guess I want to know, would you forgive your parent if they were dying anyway? Would you prefer that you were spared the inevitable of seeing your parent emaciated and in pain and suffering? Or would you be upset that you were robbed of the time? I will die. They won't be spared that regardless. But maybe I can spare myself and them some pain.",reddit
terminal,"Hello everyone! I’m sorry if this is extremely gloomy but I can’t think of anywhere else to ask. I’m 27F terminal with metastatic BC spread to the skeleton. I’ve been diagnosed for a little under a year. So far I’m still working full time and managing the side effects of my meds pretty well. However twice now my treatment plan has failed to show significant progress which means I’m headed towards heavy chemo and radiation. In turn, I know what’s coming, and it ain’t pretty. To be honest I don’t really ever want to experience what a “collapsed spine” or “severe bone pain” feels like. I’d rather die as my own, vibrant self, before I’m reduced to a woman who can no longer walk or properly take care of herself. At first I thought I’d get lots of illegal drugs and head off deep into the woods, have a major trip and then pass out peacefully in the dewy moss and never wake up again. But then I also want to give my family an opportunity to partake in my life ending and I don’t want to rob them of an opportunity to grieve or process. After all they’re the ones stuck with the loss of me, and I get to pass on in peace. Has anyone of you had any experience with euthanasia? I live in Europe so I can have this done in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Portugal or Belgium. I’m not a citizen of either of these countries but I have sufficient funds to stay in any of these countries for as long as investigation might take. I’ve done extensive research on the process of this and I know what it’s about and the potential hardships that might come with it. I just really don’t want to die being a shell of myself. I want to LIVE as long as I live, and I want to die with dignity. I know I might live on for years and that this cancer fucking shit is very unpredictable, but I’m a planner and I like to plan. I would highly appreciate any experiences, advice or thoughts. Love you guys, you’re the best.",reddit
terminal,"39 year old here. Best shape of my life. A few years back, I decided that I needed to make lifestyle changes so that I could be here to watch my son grow old. Lost over lbs, working out on a regular basis, very regulated diet, and even started running for the first time in my life (I have run the Running with the Devil charity 5K in support of local hospitals. We just got back from celebrating my sons birthday in Disney World a few weeks ago when I started getting abdominal pains. At first, I thought it was just indigestion, but it got worse. I ended up in the hospital two weeks ago, and they found gallstones. They figured one escaped, so they did an MRI where they found a mass in my Bile Duct. Went to get an ERCP and they found another mass in my duodenum. Biopsy for that came in yesterday, and its adenocarcinoma. Got the call from my GI saying, although the liver biopsy isn’t complete, it looks like the same there too. Looks like I have cancer that resides in my biliary duct, and has spread to my duodenum. Talk about a shock! The doctor said it’s almost unheard of for someone my age without a history of ulcerative colitis or a family history of this exact cancer to get this. Guess I’m special. We are seeing an Oncologist tomorrow. This is the oncologist that treated my moms late stage ovarian cancer that every other doctor told her was terminal. He kept her alive, now it’s his turn to deal with me. It’s all weird though. I’m not scared, I’m not upset, I’m not even in denial. I have accepted it, and I’m ready to kick the shit out of this thing and move on! I’m ready to put the foil on and fight this fucker! (Slapshot reference for those confused) The only thing that terrifies me is having to explain it to my 7 year old son. We plan on doing that tomorrow after we meet with the oncologist and have a solid plan. This is also extremely weird and new to me. I have never had any major health issues. I have never even had a single stitch put in my body, not even a wisdom tooth removed. Either way, gloves are off, and it’s fight time! Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get it out of my system!",reddit
terminal,"8 weeks ago, I was admitted to the hospital for back pain and they thought it was stage 2 adenocarcinoma but it has been determined to be stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma which is terminal. I have been in the hospital the whole time trying to figure things out. I am employed in Rhode Island and have 4 weeks left on FMLA. I do not have short term disability but I do have long term disability but that can only start 26 weeks after I was first admitted (LTD would start May 27, . The cancer is terminal and I am in palliative care receiving radiation treatment at the hospital. If FMLA ends on January 30th, can I get fired before LTD kicks in on May 27th? I have tried to speak with my HR group but it's rats maze of robots, being on hold, and speaking to people who have no clue who to ask. In the 8 weeks, I have been hospitalized, I have called nearly every day and only talked to a supervisor that helped me once. I am not able to work and will likely never leave the hospital again and I'm trying to remain positive but I'm so worried about what will happen after FMLA ends. To make matters worse, I found out my FMLA leave ended on December 19th, two days before my terminal cancer was discovered, and I am now trying to get back on. My benefits supervisor said they only mail letters and it was mailed to my house which I have not been at in 8 weeks. They said the best thing to do is log in every day to confirm my status which seems like torture if I've never left the hospital.",reddit

Years now. yes i lost my god daughter at 13 to some random ass osteosarcoma half way thru my own battle. Now im living life best i can. im doin everything and anything to spend time with my family. I passed the six month mark they gave me or am just about to. Am i scared? I was. i dont think i am anymore but i had wicked panic attacks for the first couple months after the terminal diagnosis. when i went thru anaphalectic shock during a treatment and almost bought it then. Hospice is great, but the pain is making me a little low down now. Im tired guys. i pray, ive made my peace with God. I want my niece to come get me when its time. Ive lurked here but havent posted much. a long time ago a man was on here, he posted once abt having the wierd adenocarcinoid shit i have and he was terminal at the time, i was in here under a diff name. I told him i was 5 years in and i told him not to be afraid it was gonna be ok. he answered me and then after a few months he was gone. now its my turn. My heart is broken for my wife. my heart is broken for my elderly parents, my heart is broken for my brothers and sisters and their kids. Im just venting, ive been physically hurting alot lately and im depressed i guess. I have a go fund me for my funeral expenses and medical, ive done the whole support bla bla blah. The whole thing. so this is how it goes. listen, please, anyone out there thats feeling low, feeling their diagnosis is a fucking death sentence. Stop. Just stop and realize you may be punching your ticket sooner rather than later, but dont ever stop being you. Thats when u give in to this little bastard inside you. Be you, even if your stuck in the bed, or in some damned hospital. Make aure your family sees you in there, be loved, love. in my time to think, thats what ive discovered. The whole point of this life is to love and be loved. Money doesnt mean shit, your career doesnt mean shit, your things and stuff doesnt mean shit. Its those you love and who love u that matter.

terminal,"I’ve been a part of this group for a while now, but I finally decided to share my story in hopes that it reaches the right person who needs to see it. I am the unicorn of cancer patients. I have always lived my life, knowing that I cannot control what happens to me, but I can control how I react to it. I grew up drinking poison water. We didn’t know it was poison water at the time until the chemical plant exploded and everyone developed cancer. My brain tumor diagnosis came first, an inoperable terminal malignant meningioma. It would be followed by stage 3 triple negative breast cancer. I would then also have precancerous masses removed in . I would be treated successfully for the breast cancer in with no current reoccurrence of that particular breast cancer. I would also be successfully treated for the brain tumor in Hawaii (California would not try to treat it. I have been successful in treating my original diagnosis with no evidence of either one right now. However, this year on routine mammograms, I had 2 new primary breast cancers picked up. That would make 4 primary cancers so far in my life. It was caught early, stage 1. I am currently on a new seven-year treatment plan. I am doing Carboplatin, Taxotere and Keytruda. I will be on Keytruda for a year followed by 5 years of Tamoxifen. I was 37 when all of this started, I had two young children and now I am 53. I expect to get a very good result after all of the treatment and hopefully get another 15 or 20 years before I need treatment again. I would say acceptance is key in dealing with breast cancer. I accepted a long time ago that the likelihood I would need treatment again is pretty high, but ultimately that treatment would extend my life again. I guess I just want to encourage everyone that even though there’s no cure for breast cancer, you can still live your best life possible, so please don’t give up. I definitely had some really dark days especially after I had brain surgery, but I’m thankful I never gave up. I got to live much longer than originally thought, they said I wouldn’t make it past 40 and here I am at 53 I got to meet my grandchild. Please feel free to ask me anything.",reddit
terminal,"I am a 21 year old woman with terminal cancer. I have recently chosen to end life-lengthening treatment. I will most likely be dead before I turn 22. Yes, it sucks. Yes, it's unfair. Yes, I desperately wish I could have more time without going through more chemo or radiation or surgeries. No, that is not an invitation for every crazy idiot to come out of the woodwork and suggest woo-woo pseudo-science cures or try and preach their religion or spirituality at me. I'm sure these people mean well but it drives me absolutely crazy. You are not my doctor. You do not know the specifics of my case. You cannot possibly provide accurate medical advice, even if you were an actual medical professional, and I'd wager the people doing this are not actual medical professionals. If turmeric or baking soda or B17 supplements were an actual cancer cure, we would not have cancer, and we sure as hell wouldn't be poisoning or irradiating or cutting into ourselves if we could just sleep with a crystal under our pillows instead. And no, there is no global conspiracy to keep people sick with cancer or kill people using cancer, and no one is secretly hiding the cure for cancer. And I am quite happy with my personal understanding of death and my spiritual beliefs. I do not need to believe in any god or an afterlife to come to terms with my death. I am, in fact, quite content with the idea of nothingness. I like that this life was all I got, even if I didn't get much of it. It makes my life precious. What's the point if this was all just a blip before the real thing? Why would I want this to be nothing but a test to get into the right afterlife? If I have eternity in front of me, then the brief 22 years on this planet wouldn't mean anything. And if I'm wrong, then, cool, I'm wrong. But, more importantly, why do you care what I believe? My experience of death and whatever waits beyond has no impact on you. Preaching at someone who doesn't want to be preached at is nothing but self-serving. It isn't helpful, it isn't kind or comforting, it won't change someone's mind. It costs you zero dollars and takes zero effort to keep your mouth shut in matters that are none of your business. You do not need to insert yourself and your beliefs into someone else's journey with their own death. You will not change a mind by annoying someone who is already dealing with something difficult. I assure you anyone with cancer or any serious illness has heard it all before, and all you're doing is reinforcing their contempt for your particular beliefs. Ask permission before preaching or giving advice, or better yet, only give your advice to people actively seeking it. It really isn't difficult to be respectful and kind.",reddit

terminal,"I'm depressed. I have stage 4 lung cancer at 24 and I really am not enjoying life lately. Before I got diagnosed I was the type of person to work really hard towards achieving my goals and dreams with massive emphasis on long term. I was the type of person to totally be down to sacrifice the enjoyment of my 20s to live good 30's and onwards. I'm the type of person where if I feel like I'm not working towards accomplishing something then I will get depressed. Well now with this disease it's been stripped from me and I'm just really lost at what to do. I stopped my classes, I don't work, and I stopped running my business. I have enough money for the rest of my life so finances aren't an issue, but now all I do all day is consume media and play video games and occasionally hang out with friends and family. In theory it doesn't sound that bad, but with my type of personality it gets old quite fast.

terminal,"As all funny stories about residency begin, it started in the Intensive Care Unit. I’m a recently promoted second year Family Med resident who’s earned the privilege of becoming an ICU orders-bitch. Most of the job is a mix of data-entry and the equivalent of optimizing floral designs in a funeral home on fire. I mop up the charts, correct sodium and magnesium and potassium and phosphate levels on future corpses and immobilize and anesthetize the rest. “Mr \_\_\_\_ needs his restraints renewed before this afternoon” “Mr \_\_\_\_ needs his pain meds renewed” “Mr \_\_\_\_ needs his diet orders advanced” “Mrs \_\_\_ ’s NG tube needs an order” I loathe this rotation with every part of me. I’m working a 24. Friday to Saturday, 7AM to 7AM. The first twelve hours aren’t so bad. The usual morning of catching up on a baker’s dozen critically ill patients’ charts, talking to the badass ICU nurses who tolerate residents like myself well enough despite our stunning ignorance. Were I two floors below and two weeks past this hell of a month, I’d be a normal second year, PGY-2 sophomore lieutenant guru for the Interns on the inpatient teaching service. Were I two floors below and not isolated from my friends, my job description would comprise of *Know the census, check in on the trainwrecks, maybe expedite a discharge summary if the kids are running late* Here I’m the idiot with a couple letters after his name trying to gain the favor of the Biggest ~Pricks~ Men on Campus who you go running to when the patient has the audacity to try to die on you despite your best protracted efforts. So it’s still morning and I’ve set up camp on the furthest left terminal on the lazily curving row of desk space facing the 20 or so ICU sliding glass aquariums of the rapidly dying and essentially already dead. Ventilators, drips, and tubes galore of Frankenstein medicine buying time for some, prolonging suffering for more, and maybe, *possibly* saving the life of one. As a doctor who normally communicates with the living, you cannot imagine how annoyed I am. The day proceeds as normal these last three God-forsaken weeks: Look up and notice the intensivist has already begun rounding without so much as tapping me on the shoulder because it’s beneath him to acknowledge me directly. We see the rest of the patients. There’s about 15 full minutes of teaching mostly punctuated with …which you should look up” the way old telegraphs were punctuated with STOP. He says we’ll do an IJ later today. I decline the opportunity to personally take a scalpel to an octogenarian’s neck. No one dies during the daylight hours. No discharges or downgrades either. … Night shift. 19:00, the overnight nurses come on and my next twelve hours get more interesting. The wisdom of modern medicine has decreed that when treating the most fragile and complicated patients, the best person to take the helm from dusk to dawn is a second year resident running on equally lethal amounts of caffeine and dread. So I’m thrown the keys to the ward and now run the show. Time to pay attention. The census: your run-of-the-mill hyponatremia, a few multi-organ failures w/PMH of the everything with a management goal of, “Convince the son/daughter Mom’s dying this week” and the remaining ones trying to take me with them. The problem makers: 65M w/PMH of EtOH abuse, paroxysmal Afib, DM2, HLD, gout, found to have hyponatremia in the one-teens. Alcoholics are easy enough to take care of. Put them on CIWA protocol, squirt Ativan into their veins every so often, we’re cool. He’s only flipped out and saw a baby crawl up the wall once today and subsequently got well and truly snowed. We’ll be fine. 87F w/PMH of stage 4 breast ca w/ mets to lungs, GI tract, and brain, presenting w/ AMS. Hospital course significant for sepsis and multi organ failure requiring ICU stay w/ central line and HD. Basically a grandma with cancer of the everything, dead before she went through the sliding glass doors after it got too hard to breathe at home, but she’s still full Code. I had a 30 minute discussion thirteen hours earlier about her prognosis with a series of family members handing off the cell phone from one to the next about continuing this futility of care. Bright pink MOLST form still went unchanged for this half of the shift. 63M w/PMH of schizoaffective disorder, HTN, HLD, came in with AMS and found to have a CMP which competed for “most number of values incompatible with life” seen by the hospital. H&P significant for a diet consisting entirely of *Chobani® Greek Yogurt - With Fruit On The Bottom* (blueberry, for the record) for the last three or five years. Earlier in the day I got pimped on this patient regarding Refeeding Syndrome by the scowling, perpetually mildly perturbed Intensivist. I failed spectacularly and retreated to my furthest-left terminal to sulk while reading UpToDate. And beyond how terrifying managing the few-groups-shy-of-a-balanced-food-pyramid case is, I’m also on the clock to catch a kid tonight. Continuity delivery. She’s crowning at 2AM and I’m contractually obligated to catch her kid one floor down in the maternity ward. … 27F G3P2 w/ no significant PMH about to pop. She’s one sprinting floor down the stairs. I’d been getting progress texts all night: station and dilation and effacement all now pointing towards *if you want credit to graduate, get down here immediately* There’s a rule in my Family Medicine program that in order to become an independent, grown up doctor, one must catch exactly five (5) or more kids whose mom the Resident has seen at least three (3) times for routine prenatal care. I had seen Ms \_\_\_ well above three times for prenatal care and would not be denied my trophy. Saw Mom since her first *you’re-sure-I’m-pregnant* clinic visit. Was there the first time we picked up the kid’s heartbeat on the Doppler. I’ll trade however much they pay to do a colonoscopy or a cath just to keep being around a happy mom’s experience listening to her next new kid’s first heard heartbeats. The tocodynamometer’s peaks confirm the texts and I take note at the wails of this suffering, sweating goddess who’s now both parts future of humanity and possible minor surgical emergency. My physician’s mind calmly regards my patient’s genitals leaking blood and shit and a baby’s crowning skull as something equivalent to an art piece recreation of the War In Vietnam and I assure you I don’t freak the fuck out at all. Unrelated, most of my time before this was spent on checkups of healthy third graders or managing hypertension in otherwise healthy adults. The Family Medicine Intern on overnight Obstetrics, Dr \_\_\_\_ and I stand shoulder to shoulder at the business end of a uterus so we can get both get credit for catching this kid. No time for booties for me, I’m lucky to have had the handful of seconds to put on a mask and splatter-resistant gown. The L&D nurses and the Midwife play overenthusiastic cheerleaders at the crest of each contraction wave. To be honest, they’re doing the majority of the work. *Push push push push push push* annnnnnd *BREATHE” They hold her hands, they help fight her agony. Then, a miracle occurs. … I’ve been told this is one of the happiest moments of your life. The culmination of so much worry, and want, and love on a level no one understands until they see the face of their first child the first time. For me, Mom’s blood is puddling against my black Chucks and I’m dreading playing tug of rope with the afterbirth then shakily stitching Mom’s perineum / boink bridge flesh wound back together. Labor for a Resident is so much more than just catching the kid. Still work to be done even after the small triumph of not fumbling a newborn’s head onto the tile despite having zero training on playing quarterback to a hiked football covered in lube. Labor stages have a second half after you’d think the shift should be done. *Stage 3 of 4: After the baby is born, you continue to have contractions so that the placenta can be born* *Stage 4 of 4: The two hours after birth when breastfeeding can be established. Contractions continue as the uterus will shrink* I clamp off the umbilical cord twice a couple inches apart but neglect to milk the center of the tissue outwards. Professional OB/GYNs, please don’t spoil the ending. I create the anatomical equivalent of a pressurized blood balloon. Which I then proceed to cut, sharp end of the scissors directly anatomically inferior to my face. A miniaturized Bellagio fountain spray of cortical blood unleashes upward, making a splattered streak of red from my right cheek to my glasses to my forehead to an already-red single curl of my hair to the fucking *ceiling. None of that is a lie, none of that is an exaggeration. The cleaning crew had to replace a ceiling tile after my handywork. The L&D nurses got a good laugh that pre-dawn. I’m too punch drunk from lack of sleep to do anything but laugh along and think *of course. … I take the stairs double step back up to the ICU. I taper off the adrenaline rush for an hour checking in on my ICU patients’ charts. Everyone is still alive, no reports of toddlers tapdancing on the ceiling, Cancer of the Everything’s still breathing, Chobani’s labs are looking better. I crash in an unused ICU bed in the furthest possible left-most side of the unit. Smells like plain hospital detergent and hospital plastic, feels like scratchy hospital linen and a flat hospital pillow. For all I care, might as well be like slipping into a warm hotel bed with a fiancé. I’m vaguely aware of the electric bed inflating at odd places from time to time to save me from bed sores. I awake to my phone’s alarm exactly one hour and seventeen minutes later for morning sign out. I take pride in reporting my patient census is one higher than it started 24 hours prior.",reddit
terminal,"In I was diagnosed with stage 4 of a severely aggressive bone cancer after months of severe pain in my sacrum and left leg. I was diagnosed the month before I turned 16. Ewing’s Sarcoma. Rare, and even rarer to have it where I did. One big angry tumour in my sacrum, wrapping around all the nerves in my leg. I named her Shannon. So because it was an aggressive cancer, we needed to hit it with an even more aggressive chemo protocol. The protocol I was under would have killed an adult, but because I was/am a kid, it only severely harmed me. I was bedridden for the full year and a bit of treatment. I did 36 radiation fractions, and 11 rounds of chemo in my induction phase, and then a round every three weeks for a year. It was supposed to be every 2 weeks, but because it was hurting my body and threatening my blood counts so much, we had to add an extra week of recovery time. It was the most horrible year of my life. All my friends were out partying and dating and having fun, and I was so sick I couldn’t even go to school. I was barely conscious at all. A few of my friends were amazing during it all and stuck by me, doing everything and anything to help the stress on me and my family. They were bloody amazing, and i’m never going to be able to repay them for making my year that bit easier. Halfway through treatment, I was admitted to the ICU after a few scary low blood pressure readings. I basically lived in hospital all year so it wasn’t much of a bother. I couldn’t really grasp how sick I was for those 8 days in the ICU until I overheard nurses talking about how if I hadn’t have made it down there that night, I would have died. So a few major emergency surgeries later and another few months of treatment, I made it. I did it. I got my N.E.D (No Evidence of Disease, because there’s never a certain “you’re cancer free” with Ewings) January this year. I’d won. During my recovery, I went to physio and learnt how to walk again and got stronger. I even made it to school for a few days. And then the pain started. This time in my ribs on my right side. We treated the pain for a while, and then it was time for my 6 month check up scans. I lit up EVERYWHERE. I had a massive tumour in my spine, wrapping around my spinal cord and causing the pain in my ribs. There were tumours in my ankles and legs and shoulders and lungs. It was official. I’m terminal. There’s no way to stop it, and I’m currently on more treatment to at least slow it down and buy me some time. I’m dying. I’m in a few months. I’m not ready to die. I can’t. I can’t leave my family and friends behind. My mum is my entire world. I love her more than anything and owe her everything I have and ever will have. She’s everything I could ever hope to be and I’m leaving her. She has to lose her daughter. I can’t do that to her. I’ve got an older sister - my best friend in the world. I can’t leave her either. We promised we’d grow old together. We promised we’d spoil each other’s kids. And then there’s my 12 year old brother - my baby. I’m supposed to look after him, to protect him. And I won’t be able to do that. He’s 12 for Christ’s sake he can’t lose his sister. I can’t do that to him - he should be worrying about not having enough v-bucks on fortnite for the new skin, not about how he’s going to deal with everything when his older sister fucking dies. And my half siblings, a 6 year old sister and a 2 year old brother. I love them more than anything in the entire world. My sister is my best friend and I’m hers. She looks up to me and I can’t leave her. I was supposed to watch them grow up and help her sneak out when she was older. I was supposed to be there to help them with homework and relationship trouble. And now I can’t. I’ll never see any of my younger siblings graduate or get their first girlfriends or boyfriends. I’ll never see them get married. I’ll never meet their kids. And the worst part is that they’re all so young that they’re gonna forget me. For the 12 year old, he’ll remember me, but over the years it’s gonna get harder and harder to remember the times we’ve fought or played or bickered. He won’t remember my mannerisms or the times we’d spend hanging out in my room. And the babies won’t remember anything about me. That’s what’s breaking my heart. All the games and the stories and the lullabies and the secrets - gone. They won’t remember anything. I’ll just be the older sister they never knew that passed away when she was a teenager. I can’t leave my family behind. I just can’t do it. I’m not ready. And my best friend. The friend that I was planning to move out after school with. The friend that has stuck by me the most. The friend that was ready to carry my children because I couldn’t anymore (thanks to the radiation. The friend that I was going to grow old with and bicker with endlessly. I’m not going to have her anymore. And again, I’ll just be the friend she had when she was young that passed away. I can’t do this. I don’t want to do this. But I don’t have a choice. My doctor said he’d be surprised if I made it to the end of the year. That’s 2 months. 2 months to say my goodbyes and to make as many memories as I can with as many of my loved ones as I can. I’m not ready. Please god please I just don’t want to die. I just needed to vent to someone, anyone. I’m sorry. It’s 1am and everyone’s asleep, and I didn’t want to burden my mum by letting her know I’m feeling like this right now. She worries too much as it is. *UPDATE* So I’m still here, as you can tell. I’ve been fighting like hell, and it definitely hasn’t been easy - but I’m okay. I’m doing well actually (head wise, at least. Pain is under control, nausea is under control and all that Jazz. I’ve stopped chemo, because towards the end it had just stopped working altogether. So for now we just zap any problematic tumours with radiation if they start causing too much pain / too many problems. I’ve recently had a fall, and really smacked my right foot. So it’s been out of action for about a week now, but i’m slowly recovering. I’ve also been on oxygen for a couple months now because my lungs just aren’t doing the job completely. Nothing too bad; as in I could technically go without the oxygen’s help - it just wouldn’t be too fun. Otherwise. I’ve really been okay. (Just don’t ask about my dad. Ugh. Lmao) We all know my time’s coming, but if the time since I’ve made this post has meant anything - it means I can fight a little longer, as long as I’ve got my family and friends behind me. I appreciate all of you guys that have stuck by me and sent in your continuous support. It was always crazy sweet reading your messages and always really uplifting. So thank you. Here’s to this not being my last update, either! Xxxx",reddit
terminal,"Hello hello and hello! I've been posting and commenting in this community more and more, and today I am officially 1 full complete year into remission with stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer. It's crazy to believe that I'm 32 and alive with one of the most deadly cancers and the fact that my liver had taken the most damage. But hear I am.alive.crying because I'm gonna make it. Unfortunately, even with remission, I'm still considered terminal since as many of you know, I can't be cured and will always have this, and that surgery is not possible because it would kill me. It's been a crazy year, and I've been battling the depression more and more each day becaof what cancer took from me, but I came back and took more from it. I spend most my time playing video games, spend time with my parents, and watch the shows and movies I missed. Most importantly, I spend time telling my story to groups such as this and also making tiktoks so that I can reach out to people who are going thru a terminal illness or cancer who don't have friends or family to talk to, because I sincerely believe no one should ever fight alone, ever. I love knowing that I'm doing my dream of helping people. Even though I have no money or anything, I still have a heart and I wanna do my best to help give people hope. Even when someone is tired and weak, and is feels as if they can't fight anymore, I fight for them, I tell them how important it is that have you here, and that you'll get through this. It'll be tough, it'll hurt, but together, we will win. Sorry for making this longer than it should, I love being able to talk. Here's to seeing another year ️ my inbox is always open if you need a friend. Please don't ever be afraid to talk to me. I love you, and I believe in you",reddit
terminal,"Hi everyone. Lung cancer guy again. Bad things are happening. Just got home from the hospital and barely avoided being admitted thanks to a palliative NP rushing over in the middle of the night to admit me into the home hospice program. I am forever grateful to her. I'm meeting the physician today. What kinds of questions should I ask? My current list of questions is: - Can you manage my pain after years of bupenorphine maintenance? - Will someone be available to help me write letters? I'm cut off from my family but want to make amends. - Will someone be with me all the time? I don't want to die alone and don't have anyone to call. - Will I avoid terminal Restlessness and delirium? That is my only fear right now. I don't think I have many more questions. Probably can't respond to many comments and PMs like I did last time. I'll try to post an update before I die. Thank you for your help. Edit: would also be nice to hear from others who have hospice experience. Edit: thank you for your kind offers of helping me transcribe letters. I am not feeling strong enough tonight but perhaps tomorrow. Though, if things keep up at the same pace, tomorrow won't be looking too good. I will try to reach out if I can.",reddit
terminal,"Hello all. I hope this update doesn't break any rules, as I suppose I do not have any questions. Mods, let me know. I did not want to just disappear from reddit. I know a number of you have been thinking about me. I said I would post an update before I passed away and, well, here I am. I know it is fast. But things have been happening fast. I don't mean to flood this sub with my misery. I'm on some heavy duty medications. I hope this doesn't come off as rambling. This will be my final post. The Cancer is all through both sides of my chest and above my collarbone. It's over. I was diagnosed with Extensive Stage small cell lung cancer and given four months to live on the 6th. Well, it seems ""two weeks"" was a more accurate approximation of my time. I am not long for this world. As for what happened- I wasn't slated to meet my hospice team till yesterday, Friday. I went to the ER on Thursday with chest pain. They took a lot of fluid out of my chest. The ER physician described my imaging as ""grotesque"" and immediately asked if I had considered palliation. I said I didn't see hospice till tomorrow. He said if I wanted any chance of dying at home, I needed to see them NOW, otherwise he'd have to admit me. He won't be getting any awards for bedside manner any time soon, but I greatly appreciated his candor. Several urgent phone calls later I had a palliative Nurse Practitioner in my room who went through the screening process and admitted me to their home hospice program. I went home Friday morning with a hospice kit. Met the palliative physician that evening, shortly after I posted my list of questions here. I will not see Christmas, or Thanksgiving, or even next weekend. Every breath is work. Each one more work than the last. My team estimates that, at this rate, I will die Tuesday at the absolute latest. Probably sooner. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe tonight. My oncologist called to personally apologize for misjudging my remaining time, but I hold him no ill will. Determining the time of death is not an exact science. I know that. I'm arranging to donate my body to science. I want them to do an autopsy and see how it got me so quickly, to help other cancer patients. The oncologist thinks the cancer may have gotten to my heart or the major central blood vessels. I didn't think small cell could move THIS fast but my oncologist says we caught it late. My hospice team has been wonderful. I have crossed tapered from bupenorphine- which I discontinued Wednesday- to methadone, with little difficulty. I have a lot of morphine and the option of hydromorphone is on the table as well if needed. I am comfortable and resting at home. The next stop on the train is continuous sedation, and I am very tired, so I probably will not be able to respond to anyone like I did last time. My physician says we can start a midazolam drip as soon as tonight. I will probably take him up on the offer tomorrow, if I'm still alive. I suppose this is a good place to share where my fears around palliation come from. I used to be an aid in a nursing home, many years ago. I saw a number of unpleasant deaths due to insufficient palliation. We had a wonderful man who was prescribed a self administration pump for morphine. Problem was, he was too sick to press it, and his physician did not seem to grasp the severity of his condition. Every half hour, one of us would sneak in and press the button on his pump, which, in hindsight, was probably illegal, but what else could we do? He was very uncomfortable at the end. I tried to do basic mouth care just before he passed and he recoiled in pain. ""Have a heart, he whispered. It broke my heart to hear this admonition from such a wonderful man. My greatest fear was Terminal Restlessness. I saw a few patients scratch their faces and tear their fingernails out as they died, even on high doses of opioids and benzodiazepines. My palliative physician has assured me that he won't let that happen and that there is no limit to what they can give me. I feel much reassured. I have tried to write letters to the people I've wronged. I suddenly find that I want to make amends. So many letters. I was a functioning addict for a long time. My family cut me off, rightfully so. So I have been writing a lot of letters. But I am losing strength. I will not be able to write many more letters. My CNA has transcribed one letter template for everyone. I hope it is enough. I also had many kind offers to transcribe letters from Redditors here on the sub. What love that you would do that for a stranger. If I was strong enough to talk on the phone, I would have taken you all up on it, but I can barely talk. Perhaps, had I not been so stunned by my diagnosis, I could have arranged this sooner. But that is in the past now. Dad, if you somehow see this post, I know how much I hurt you and and I am sorry. I wish I could call you. I do not even know where you live and I'm not strong enough to find you. I do not ask for your love, for that is beyond my power to ask. Just your forgiveness is enough. Please Dad, forgive me. I do not want die without your forgiveness. But I will, won't I? I beseech you all to make amends with those you begrudge. Do not go to bed angry or hold hate in your heart. You will be glad that you forgave. I wish I had done so sooner, before I ran out of time. You will run out of time, too, some day in the future. Don't leave any business unfinished, any grudge unmended. There a nicotine patch on my arm. A reminder of one of the several self destructive habits that brought me here. My smoking habit was not had enough to set things off this quickly, but it clearly did not help. For those of you who smoke, I have but one message: stop it. Please. You think you will wait till you are ready. You will never be ready. You say you will quit tomorrow, but then tomorrow becomes today, and you are never ready today, only tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes. Today is the only day in which the decision can be made. You can only quit TODAY. Do so now. Throw your cigarettes in the trash. Do it for me. What a gift it would be that my post would free you of tobacco's golden chains. As difficult and shocking as these last few weeks have been, I regard them as positive. Only four weeks ago, I thought that the universe was a cold and cruel place. I experienced physical and mental abuse, chronic pain, and addiction. But my situation has forced a change of perspective. I see now that all our experiences, no matter how horrid, are temporary, and that we will all find the same rest and peace in the end. I do not mean to give the wrong impression to those struggling with depression. I have tried to kill myself before. The difference between then and now is vast. Death is an old friend waiting to greet you at the end of a long and well lived life. It can not be appreciated properly when sought in darkness. I know there is no magic fix for depression, but I urge you to get up, go out, and live the crazy, wonderful, irrational, beautiful life you want. If only I had done the same. What a gift is life! Thank you all for your love, empathy, and reassurance. For all the people who PMed me offering to help with transcribing letters, for all the kind messages and comments. You are all beautiful people. I hope you remember that. No matter what anyone else says or thinks, or even what you yourself think, you are beautiful and can only be so, because you reached out to a stranger in his moment of pain. Your hearts will always carry that little light of goodness no matter how dark your days. Carry that little light with you and forget it not. It can brighten a stranger's day. It can even save the world. A few PMed me asking to look into their religion. In the past I would have been irritated. Now I recognize that you were concerned for my souls well being. Thank you for your compassion. I am not well versed on religion, but I have prayed, and I trust that whatever higher power may dwell above the stars will look upon my situation with infinite love and compassion. This in my heart I know. /u/hugegrape, you wanted to make me a plushie free of charge. Your care and empathy have touched my heart. I'm sorry to say that I will not be in a position to receive it. I did not expect to go this fast. I want you to make it anyway. I want you to keep it with you and know that you will always have a part of me. I hope this brings you some comfort. You have my everlasting love and gratitude. Wishes are usually reserved for the future. I have no future. But I find myself still wishing. I wish I had not worried so much about the little things. I wish I had not worried so much about the numbers in my bank account or the punch of the time clock. All that time working. I had enough money to keep a roof over my head and to invest in what few hobbies I had, yet I still kept racking up overtime. And for what? Only to find myself here. It all came to nothing in the end. I robbed myself of the most precious commodity I had, time, in exchange for green pieces of paper and little metal discs. A perverse and twisted trade. Only now do I see the truth. I wish I had had the courage to live my life the way I wanted to. I wish I had traveled the world, fallen in love, written a novel. I wish I had had children. I have no one to whom I can pass my life lessons. No one to sit by my side, here at the end of my world. It is too late for me. But it is not too late for you. Live the life YOU want, no matter how strange it may seem to others or to society. It is your life and yours alone. Live it well. I'm not sure where I go from here. I have been reading accounts of the afterlife from various cultures. Summerland, Elysium, Tir Na Nog. I've also taken to reading The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, though it seems I will run out of time before I can finish. What a strange feeling. I personally do not believe consciousness survives death, but I'm open to being pleasantly surprised. And if not, well, who can complain about a siesta that can't be interrupted? Regardless of what awaits me, it is nice to dream. And that is what I will do now. I will dream. I will rest and dream of the peace to come till I dream no more. May you all one day face death with this same wonderful dream. I do not have any friends or family to sit here with me, so I am leaving this tab open. I will read your comments and savor your reassurances, even if I do not reply. I will keep you all here with me. I feel less alone this way. I will keep you all with me as I die. You people are all I have now. I am strong but I am scared. Stay with me till I'm gone. I do not want to be alone. Till we meet again, my beautiful friends. Robert S Edit: just woke up from my nap and I'm overwhelmed by the outpouring of love. I'm touched by the people throwing away their cigarettes and finding the courage to pursue the life they want. What a blessing you all are. I am reading every message I can even if I don't respond. Tears streaming down my face. Now I know I will not die alone. What a gift this sub has given me. Edit 2: Sunday at 2:30 pm. Haven been awake much but I've read as much as I can. How I cherish your love and kindness. You helped a grumpy drug addict die with love in his heart and a smile on his face. the doc will be here at 3 to give versed. I'm tired of trying to breath. chaplain has given me last rites. Its over now my friends. I love you. Good bye",reddit
terminal,"Well they didn’t technically use that word, but that’s what it is. The only treatment options I have (IV chemo or oral chemo) will never cure me, they may not even affect my tumours at all. My cancer came back in my lungs, pelvis, and other parts of my body too, after almost 2 years NED. I’m so fucking pissed off. It’s so unfair that my type of cancer gets next to no funding, no alternatives, no trials, no studies. Nothing. I get to decide between two equally shit options, and I just have to deal with the fact that I’m not gonna be here a year from now. And I’m 19. Life is so fucking stupid. If anyone reading this is also terminal, please reach out.",reddit
terminal,"After a year of fighting I am terminal. I will go in Monday for aggressive immunotherapy and chemotherapy in a palliative setting. Now it's finally happening I find myself abandoned. I've been fighting for my children, my wife (she died December) and myself. Everything I've been doing I have done alone. Doctor visits, appointments for various procedures and even the day I was told I was terminal, I was alone. Somehow I've become the bad guy, the guy who 'should go to hospice, the guy who's kids (via ex-wife) are suddenly too busy to see me. My vision of being surrounded by love and companionship at the end has vanished. If I try to spend time with my family they are just not willing to be there. I am frightening to the kids now. I should just stop bothering them. I get that they are frightened too. They will lose their dad. 13 and 15 years old, still young. But when I try to see them to comfort them, to show them that I am still alive now and that we should make some happy memories, I am rejected. My ex-wife gets angry and mama bear about it all. It's like I am the bad one. We were so close before, we shared 50/50 custody, we all got on well. Now I am dying I have become some kind of irritant. I am utterly alone and feeling as if I am so evil for dying. I haven't expressed myself well. I'm not usually so 'poor me' but if I can't be sad when I'm dying when can I be? Why am I ostracised? EDIT/UPDATE: What an amazing group of beautiful, compassionate, and understanding people you all are. Thank you for all of your words, I read each and every one and wish I had the strength to reply individually to you all. Especially those of you who are young and give me a perspective of how you feel/felt. I would only écho what others have said in that 'be kind to yourself' if you can. We can only do our best. I don't blame my kids for being the way they are. I feel their fear and want to help work through this with them, for them. Daddy has suddenly revealed himself to be mortal. Not the invincible hero we all were before this horrible disease struck. I have taken positive steps since posting, and your advice. One, I have tried to be kind to myself. To accept what I can not change. I have also taken my children and my ex-wife to an organisation that specialises in palliative care and who run the hospice I will inevitably become an unwilling guest of. They help the patient and the families navigate this choppy water with an objective view and the knowledge they have. None of us were taught this at home or at school. Just like being parents was never taught except by our own parents. And that is not always a great school ) There, I had the opportunity to tell them how I felt and hear what they felt. That I wanted to spend time with them. That I did not want to force them to do anything they felt they were not capable of and beg them not to feel guilty for anything. I just want to avoid them having regrets later in their lives because we squandered the time we have now. It's easier for me. I will die. They have to survive with all of this. They are resilient, thank God, and time will heal. My ex-wife, who I was very cross with when I wrote the original post, is not a bad person. I realise that she is just as frightened by all of this as everyone else. She hasn't experienced death as I have. She is reacting protectively, but the meetings showed her that I am not a 'nightmare or threat, I am a human with feelings too and I got the chance to say this in a controlled environment. She only accepts what I say is true when it comes from someone else bizarrely ) For me, it was an honour to spend the last three days of my own mother's life with her. Playing her songs, talking to her comatose body, keeping her as comfortable as possible until she eventually passed in my arms with me telling her how much I loved her. The chest that had given me food and comfort as a baby fell for the last time whilst my head was on it. She was not alone. I was, however, in my 30s. It's different for my children, and I get it. I think the psychology meetings, which will continue, really did help take some of the fear from them. I noticed immediately that they were more chatty and we spent some fun times flying a drone that afternoon. Tough times are ahead, but now we have guidance. Now I have a voice. I have an identity which isn't first and foremost a terminal cancer patient. I am still the same. I feel the same, I am the same man I ever was. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for all the selfless love you have shown. It really helped me overcome the madness i was engulfed in. I wish each and every one of you peace and ease on whichever part of your journey you are on. May your beliefs hold you steady. I am also free to chat for anyone who needs help or just an ear. Love is all that matters. X",reddit
terminal,"77M, 5'8, approximately lbs, epilepsy since , newly diagnosed brain tumor and hypertension. Now on meds for seizures, high blood pressure, and steroids to reduce swelling from the tumor. Hey guys, My dad has what seems to be a terminal brain tumor, and is currently living in a rehabilitation/skilled nursing facility. He recently developed a fever, terrible productive cough, was sleeping all day, etc. Blood test showed his WBC count is double what it should be. The on-site doctor thinks it's probably an infection from the wounds/lesions on his scalp. Doctor said he could give antibiotics, but that he thinks it would be better to skip antibiotics and wait for my dad to become septic and die from that. He says this will be a better death than what could be further down the road - he seems particularly worried about the possibility of developing pneumonia. I asked isn't sepsis a painful way to die, and he said no, it's not painful, and they'll keep him comfortable with Tylenol. I agreed to it, but Dr. Google says that sepsis IS very painful (organs shutting down, heart attack symptoms, etc, so I called the hospice line I was given - the nurse said he's never heard of forgoing antibiotics for an infection, even on hospice, and that it's worrying that this is the doctor's plan. I can't seem to find another doctor willing to talk for a second opinion, though. I just need to hear your opinions on this. From your experience, is sepsis painful? Is this a plan that you've seen before and makes sense? Would you skip the antibiotics? Any information or resources would be very much appreciated. Thank you! . Edit: Thank you so, so much to everyone who has responded! I'm so grateful that this post gained so much attention, because I think I now have a better understanding of the possible experiences. From what I gather from your comments, it is possible to have sepsis without excruciating pain, but that isn't the norm. I wonder if the doctor has only ever seen those outliers, and that's why he expects that my dad will only require Tylenol 🤔 I asked the doctor to start him on antibiotics. Hopefully, I won't regret that decision, but considering the information I currently have, I can't purposely do that to him - especially since this doctor doesn't seem worried about the very real possibility of pain. I'm trying to get him moved somewhere that specifically deals with patients at the end of their life, but it's so far been impossible because he doesn't have Medi-Cal, yet. If my dad does end up with sepsis at some point, I'll make sure to fight for the good pain and anxiety meds. I'll be slowly responding to as many comments as I can, while I deal with the chaos. Just know that I truly appreciate every one of you for sharing your opinions and experiences ️",reddit
terminal,"I have stage 4 lymphatic metastasis rare cancer. I'm not terminal yet but I've become permanently disabled. I was diagnosed in . About 90% of the cancer patients that have my cancer have passed away. I'm part of a community group with this type of rare cancer, so when I searched through many of the old posts, the family members would share that their loved ones had lost the fight. I have 2 children and both are still school-aged. I'm in my 40s. Since my type of cancer can affect people of all ages, sometimes I feel utterly sad that little kids were diagnosed with this and they didn't even had a chance to experience life yet. I know I'm living on borrowed time. I got lucky that I am still alive especially with how aggressive this cancer is. The thought that I have a ticking time bomb in me would cripple my mind from time to time. I try not to focus on that and to just appreciate the present. Unlike when I was healthy, every little symptom sends me into a frenzy because it could be a sign my cancer is back. Due to the rarity of this cancer, there's currently no way to detect or monitor if there are (if any) cancerous cells that remains in my bloodstream or lymph nodes. I'm pretty much living in fear everyday. It's mentally tiring to live this way. There are many times that I've told myself if it does come back, maybe I should just give up and end this fight. Even if I can get over one hurdle, it'll probably come back again in the future. Then again, what will my children think of me or say to my grandchildren in the future? That mommy or grandma just decided to surrender? What kind of role model would I be? I love my husband tremendously and he is my rock. No matter how much he loves me, he would never understand the turmoil that's in me and the trauma I went through. I hate to be a burden to him even though I already am. I don't want to keep worrying him with my morbid thoughts and feelings. My doctor prescribed me anxiety meds and I have cannabis to help me relax but these are only temporary. Talking to a therapist will probably help but unless someone has personally experienced what I'm going through, I don't think there's any point in telling or sharing these emotions or thoughts. Letting it all out here on Reddit actually makes me feel better. I don't need to put on a ""I'm okay"" mom, wife or sister face here. The only thing that keeps me going is to repeatedly telling myself ""let go of things you can't control"" If you've read it up to this point, thank you for staying. Vent over.",reddit
terminal,Mostly with RAGE at people who will not understand that even though I'm not dying in my bed things are not all zippety doo dah. And if one more person says I'm in remission I will bean them. I'm NOT in remission. I have stage 4 metastatic cancer with a pretty new tumour that's developed. Winter is always more painful for me and I have been sick from colds that hit harder on me than my children but I'm doing my.bloody best it's just not enough. I just wish people could understand that I don't need crying or prayers I need actual real help or for them to get out of the way. I don't have the energy to coddle anyone's emotions or help them process their crap. I have three children I'm doing that for. Some days the only one who gets it is my dog. I'm fully aware this is whiney as shit and will likely regret posting after a decent nights sleep whenever that happens. Sometimes I actually think becoming terminal would be a good thing because I would be eligible for help. Thats so wrong of me,reddit
terminal,"Hi guys! I was diagnosed with stage iv endometrial Carcinosarcoma last year and successfully completed 7 rounds of chemo/immunotherapy and now have a 6 week cycle for my immunotherapy (Jemperli) and can’t stand it! I thought it would be a cake walk after what I went through with chemo but this is making me itchy and uncomfortable on top of throwing up randomly and never really know when it’ll hit. At least with chemo I was able to time out when I’d feel awful and adjust accordingly but this has made it so I have skin that looks like a lizard, and is all scratched up but I have to carry prochlorazine (I think that’s what it is) around in case nausea hits. Has anyone else had this issue with their immunotherapy? I feel like a big baby for bringing things like this to my doc but boy I am miserable and nothing helps. I take an antihistamine and it helps a little and use benedryl-esque cream with aloe and it also helps but not enough. What do you think they’ll do for me when/if I mention it at my next appointment? I’m also concerned that it’s affecting my liver with all the itching- but that could be the hypochondriac in me lol. It’s a common side effect but I’m really hoping I won’t need to go down with my dose, keeping a recurrence away is the name of the game right now because I am essentially terminal. Odds are it’ll come back it’s just a matter of time but I want my quality of life back, I wanna go back to work I just don’t see how it’s possible yet. Please let me know I’m not the only one having a rough go with immunotherapy lol thanks friends",reddit
terminal,"I started my cancer journey back in June at the age of 36. I’m 41 and terminal now. It’s getting to the point where chemotherapy is killing me so the tumor board decided to do radiation again to give me more time. Waiting on results from a recent Brian MRI, pretty sure they found something because it’s the first time I didn’t receive my results within 24 hours. I’m done though, I’m at the point of just stopping all treatments and go travel. When it first spreads to my lungs I was optimistic but now I’m on my 6th line of treatment and breathing is becoming a chore. I’ve been doing all this treatments for my kids. My older kids are adults(21 & 20) and the baby is almost 14 and we’re in the middle of adopting her out to my Aunt and Uncle. She’s taken care of so does it make me a terrible person if I wanna just tell my oncologist to stop all treatments? Radiation to the lungs doesn’t sound appealing again. I feel guilty and upset this is my life I was chosen to live. Then again I’m tired of other people telling me they’re not ready for me to go. For some reason that triggers me more. I’m sorry MY cancer affects them but I’ve told those people to go get their own cancer and dictate what they want then. They stop giving me their opinions real quick. I hate being mean to them but they don’t understand or care to. Today is Valentine’s Day and probably my last one. months was my time frame I was given if I stopped all treatments. I see other cancer patients fight so hard to live and here I am every morning when my eyes open I’m like damn another day. My therapist says it’s normal to feel this way. I wish I could enjoy my life without feeling like it’s all for nothing. How do I make myself feel like this isn’t all for nothing? How do I enjoy my life? I’m open to ideas.",reddit
terminal,"For background - I'm 40 and have stage 4 HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, which had spread to my spinal cord, adrenal gland, and pituitary gland. I had a mastectomy to remove the primary tumor (5cm, been on tamoxifen and other drugs, chemotherapy for 12 weeks, radiation for my brain, and targeted therapy/chemotherapy combo every 3 weeks for the past 2 years (until now. I'm currently taking tdm-1 (kadcyla. I've been on treatment for almost 4 years and will probably continue for the rest of my life. I'm glad to say that over time, one by one, the tumors disappeared. First, my spine got clear, then today, my adrenal gland. Today's scan results show that only the one in my pituitary remains, and it has stayed the same size for 8 months (yay. I'm not sure if that's PCR or whatever, but regardless, I feel so f$ing amazing. In sharp contrast, on the first day of my diagnosis, I broke down and tearfully told my then boyfriend that I was going to die. And that he would have to take care of our daughter by himself, and that he should find a new girl, and that I wouldn't be around for much longer. He stopped the car in the middle of the road and started yelling, ""YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE"" about a dozen times, banging on the steering wheel emphatically. Then he proposed and I asked, ""are you sure"" in a tiny voice. We got married. He's been my rock ever since. He's pushed me through every treatment cycle and been there to push protein shakes down my throat when I couldn't eat. He learned to cook and actually took classes just so he could make the damn kale and spinach and broccoli taste better. He's helped me through 2am nosebleeds every single goddamn day and brought me to the emergency room at any time of the day regardless if he hasn't had any sleep. He's been there to clean up my vomit (also thank you to our housekeeper. He's been there to get me sweating in the gym through the pain and pushed me to complete my first half marathon. And when I got pissed at his constant reminders (I get pissed a lot, he kept at it anyway and pushed me even more. I'm healthy. I'm strong. I'll be there for my daughter's graduation, I'll see her get married, I'll see my grandkids, he always tells me. Cancer will never beat me, he always says to me. I'm gonna live til I'm 90 and we'll retire together, he always repeats. Every time I get lazy and forget my discipline, he's on my ass and I hate it but he pushes me anyway. We've not been able to have any intimacy for months because of my constant bleeding but he's soldiered on regardless. I've been so bad to him, fighting him every step of the way. I've been the worst patient and have never truly listened; I've always been resistant yet he never wavered. I'll never be able to repay him. But he says he will never need any type of repayment aside from me continuing to live life and be the best I can be. I've gone on speeches raising awareness and every time, he says, ""don't mention me at all. And every time I talk to my friends about this, he tells me to say, ""it's all you, don't talk about me"" And whenever I make a post and accidentally mention ""my husband said. "" he would go ballistic and yell at me to delete any mention of anything he's ever done for me. So this is just my little anonymous way of thanking him coz he never allows me to mention him in any way. At least here, since he hates reddit, he won't know and won't get mad. ) Today, I'm doing dozens of different hobbies as I'm pushed by my husband every day to do things to keep me positive. I'm getting really good at painting, which has become my enduring passion throughout this journey. I'm joining a dance competition soon as well, which has become my primary mode of exercise. I love videogames! I love fantasy! I love life. I love my family. I love my daughter so much and she's been my main inspiration to keep fighting. So I just wanted to write this thing (sorry it's so long) to tell everyone here: It's. Possible. It's. Not. The. End. There's. Hope. Work. Your. Ass. Off. Now, I realize that this message may rub some people the wrong way, and that some cancers are tougher. I know the feeling of hopelessness and the last thing you want is someone saying these words. I get that. I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm giving false hope. However, I was at the very bottom at one point. Doctors have hammered home that stage 4 has no cure. I'll be on treatment forever bar some medical miracle. After radiation on my brain, I couldn't recognize my family members for weeks. I couldn't even remember my name. The tumor in my pituitary had grown to such a size that I could barely see. Right now, I bleed bleed bleed every day due to my treatment. My nose is a fountain and my mouth is a lake of blood every night. At one point, I thought about death nonstop and I felt like it too. But I pushed through it and I'm kicking cancer's ass! And I'm just saying that you can do it too. You may not like it, like I f$ hate it when my husband repeats it to me nonstop, but there. Is. Hope. Phew. That's it. Sorry it was so long. I just hope that at least one person reads this and develops a positive attitude from it. If anyone needs a chat or any advice, just message me. Stay strong!",reddit
terminal,"I (23F) was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer almost a year ago. Before I was diagnosed, I had very few symptoms, extreme fatigue (which I didn't think much of as I am a nurse and am on my feet all day) and blood in my stool. My PCP thought it would be best for me to have a colonoscopy even though she was sure it had something to do with my having a female reproductive system. I went and had the colonoscopy and they found a tumor in my colon about the size of a golf ball. I was then referred to the cancer center in my area for further testing. I met with the GI surgical team before having anything looked at and was told that (hopefully) it hadn't spread and it would be a quick and easy surgery. It was found to have spread to my liver and both lungs via the lymphatic system. Since then I have gone through 6 months of chemo, a bowel resection, and then a left lung resection. The liver was looked at before and during my bowel surgery, but the Drs couldn't see anything and decided it would be best to leave it and monitor it in the future. I was supposed to be entered into a clinical trial for a chemo diffused directly into the right lung (this lung had more and larger mets) during surgery as a way of fully clearing out the cancer. I went for an MRI Saturday to make sure the liver hadn't changed as part of the criteria for this trial was stability of all other mets. Today I went to see my oncologist and I received the unfortunate news that there are around 15 lesions in my liver and both lungs have growing tumors. This means that it is terminal and I will have to be on chemo for the rest of my life. I'm honestly not sure how to feel about this. I wasn't given any sort of life expectancy so I have no idea what to prepare for. I feel like I'm supposed to have my whole life ahead of me and now it's being taken away from me. (and obviously I know it's so much worse for kids who are diagnosed and I'm % grateful for the life I've lived so far but I feel like I'm allowed to be angry right now) Anyways, sorry for the long post but I really needed to get this out.",reddit
terminal,"Hi friends, Here’s a backstory. Two days ago, I had fevers up to .6. I kept throwing up Tylenol. I called my oncologist and I went in for an office visit and was Covid, flu, RSV negative. They sent me home after drawing a bunch of labs and monitoring my temp. Yesterday, at 5 am, I wake up with the worst pain I’ve ever had (outside of surgical pain. It felt like a searing knife was lodged in my left upper quadrant. I took my pain meds and an edible to try and reign the pain in. It progressively got worse throughout the day and became painful to take anything more than a shallow breath. decided to go to the ER. I explain in a cancer patient, and why I’m there and the nurse takes me straight back. The PA comes in, and it’s evident he hasn’t read my chart. I mention I was at my oncologist yesterday and they drew blood cultures, etc. He quite literally asked why I had an oncologist. Okay, maybe he was busy and thought I would be an easy case to pop in and pop out. Long story short, they offered IV nausea and pain meds and I gladly accepted. /2 hours later, the pain came back full force. The nurse asks about my pain and I answered honestly. I asked if I could have something for pain, again, because I’m writhing in pain in the hospital bed. Again, offered both nausea and pain meds and I accepted. The CT shows an enlarged spleen and progression of disease. At the end of the visit, the PA came back in to see me. He told me that I “need to get in pain management” And I “can’t just come to the ER and ask for pain meds” I explained that my home pain medication controls my normal pain very well. But this wasn’t my normal pain. He again says I need to meet with pain management and walks out. I can’t help but feel they were typecasting me as a drug seeker when in reality, the only thing that hurt more than this pain was my liver resection. I’m sorry, but I have terminal cancer. I’m 37. How do you navigate situations like this? What would you have done differently? I just kind of feel disrespected and not taken seriously.",reddit

terminal,"I was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in Nov shortly after my 37th birthday. The cancer was in my bowel and pushing into my spleen, pancreas and abdominal wall. Throughout my treatment I have chemo and used thc oils as well, I had major surgery in May this year to remove my bowel, spleen, top of pancreas and abdominal wall followed by more chemo. The only advise I can offer is: Listen to your Dr's! They actually want to cure you so do as you're told. Research cannabis oils, expecially Thc, I can't say if these help remove the cancer but for the quality of life they have given me and the help. With sleep, anxiety, food has been amazing! Use them! Make getting better your No1 priority! This is before your husband/wife/children/career /social life absolutely everything. You need to be relaxing, de stressing and recovering, all of the above will be there when you're better. Oxandrolone- this is a product given to patients with aids/cancer or other diseases that cause muscle wastage. I lost 8 stone during my treatment this product helped massively in holding onto some weight and building myself back up again. And stay positive, don't fear cancer, mock it, don't ever let yourself think that cancer will beat you as this is when it will! You need to fight and dig deep and make beating cancer your priority! It can be done!",reddit
terminal,"One year ago today was the worst day of my life. I had finished treatment and at my first three-month checkup, my doctors told me that they saw little tumors in my bones. Until this point, they’d (mercifully) held off on explaining that my diagnosis is terminal. But when they saw the first metastases, they explained that curing me was impossible, and that they would only work to buy me time. If they trials didn’t work, I would have no more than 6 months. But they have worked. I still have cancer, more metastases growing slowly in my body. I continue to feel good, to have energy, to feel happy. In the past year, I’ve climbed America’s tallest sand dune (entirely before breakfast, sipped tea on the beaches of Sri Lanka, built a pergola by hand in my own backyard, and adopted a dog of my very own. I’ve gotten to know my friends, and especially my family, in a deeper more genuine sense; we’ve all changed the things we value, and hold each other much closer than we did before. I’ve gotten much better at knowing myself. I guess my point is that I didn’t know any of this was coming. I didn’t expect any of this change, any of these blessings. I didn’t know how much of it would come from me. What’s going to happen can be forecast, but we don’t really know. The shadow of grief that I felt one year ago today is still there, but by wrestling with it, I’ve become more comfortable living with it. I have made space inside myself to allow it, and it is accompanied by joy and self-satisfaction. What we are facing here is very difficult, and I’m no guru or miracle worker who can promise it will get better. But the lesson I’ve taken from the past year still holds true: if you focus on dying, you aren’t using your time and energy to really live. So you gotta choose to do one or the other. I’m still going to die. But I don’t know when, and until I go, I’m gonna try to live every goddamn second. We don’t truly know how our lives are going to go, and we have to make sure some of the “what if” rabbit holes are good. Pardon my rambling musings, but it’s a nice day, and I’m gonna go sit in my back yard now. Thank you for reading, and I wish your time in this world to be full of meaning.",reddit
terminal,On 30th of April I quit chemotherapy. And a week later I left for India. I travelled till my symptoms came. They came rather quickly I thought I would have more time. Speed forward to beginneing of June symptoms became more serious so I started to get in touch with the hospice. I opted for residential hospice meaning I leave in the hospice and I get help 24h. It was my choice to be here rather than be home. They already started giving me morphin which is quite surprising. The other painkillers do not help me anymore. I am surprised because I am still able to stand up and move without needing any help. I am wondering how long I have left till I become unconscious now that I am getting morphine. Doctors don't want to give me an answer. Do you have any idea? Any similar experience? Also if you have questions I am glad to help if I can This book Nothing to fear demystifying death to live more fully by Julie McFadden has helped me understand a lot about hospice and terminal stage care. Love you all,reddit

Its amazing the total lack of understanding people have in this day of modern technology where you can find the temp of a burger in London on the internet but cant be bothered to look up what Terminal means. The weather here has been getting better and i was at my camp. Some people i never meet before were walking/hiking and stopped for water. ( there is a spring on my property that people get water from its been tested and its very pure and clean) We were talking and asked if i would ever sell the place. I said no it was going to my niece when i passed. I said i would be here now that the weather is better and stop by anytime they see my truck. They asked if i worked because i seemed to young to be retired. I said i have cancer and now i am disabled due to being on chemo for the rest of my life and it was terminal. The woman said that's terrible only having a few months to live. I was like HUH? Ah no i have a few years yet. I will just have chemo for the rest of my life. She seemed puzzled and started asking a bunch of questions. Terminal does not mean you are going to die tomorrow. In my case it just means they cant cure it does not mean they cant control it. Some people live for years with cancer i hope i am one.,reddit
terminal,"Hey everyone ) The last month has been pretty overwhelming. As I finish up another chemotherapy option that also hasn’t worked, my anxiety has been going through the roof. I’ve been losing my mind a little bit as I’m sure a lot of you can relate.

After six years of dating we have never had the chance to do something like this but now we do. I’m so excited to escape treatment and have some fun albeit it being a little risky with where I’m at with treatment. I know how lucky I am to have this opportunity but I just wanted to come on here and share because I know this community will understand how special this is to me. I have this gut feeling that this will be our last opportunity to do something like this which is very emotional but wow I’m just so bloody excited! An added bonus is I get to avoid the annoying “you’ll get through this” conversations from relatives when my cancer is terminal. Wins all round. Anyway if you read this thanks for letting me share and listening. Idk if I can sleep tonight, can’t wait ) *UPDATE You guys are amazing, thanks so much for the support.

terminal,"I was thinking about this and felt like sharing it. Understandably, lately I feel like I am constantly reminded that it's ok not to be ok. I understand why. But we put so much emphasis on that, that I hope we don't forget that it's also ok TO BE OK 💖 wether you have just been diagnosed, are doing treatments, in remission or facing a relapse, please know that its ok to still see beauty around you. For example, I have seen so many acts of pure love in the hospital, many of them coming from nurses who truly love their job. Nurses who cried with me, held my hand and hugged me. I have been living with cancer for 7 years, I have had moments where I felt true dispair, where I felt lost and scared but some of the most beautiful moments of my life (not cancer related) were experienced while I already had cancer. Don't assume that because you have cancer, you should always be miserable. No. You can laugh! You can dance! Give yourself permission to do that.even in the midst of terror. Just the other day I was sitting in the oncology clinic waiting room with another girl in her 20s, who also had a unilateral mastectomy like me, telling her that my fake boob fell off when I bent over to tie my shoes and we were laughing so much I was crying. A dear friend of mine who passed away from cancer was making cancer related jokes even in the week she died and I also have sweet memories of being with her, in the waiting room, laughing together. Another friend of mine who lives with terminal ovarian cancer is travelling the world and telling me stories about her dates, the other day she kissed a stranger she randomly met on the beach and she says she feels sexy even though she is dying (aren't we all. Someone told me ""I think you are dealing too well with cancer, you must be in denial. Fuck off. I shouldn't feel guilty for experiencing happiness even when I was getting treatments for example. I shouldn't feel like there is something wrong with me for being hopeful and grateful. For wanting to surround myself with people that give me hope.

I have a 2 yr old boy and a wife I love both dearly. I am very big into fitness and eating healthy which is why I'm in such shock when the doctor gave me the news. I don't know what to expect. I never been more scared in my life I keep thinking about my wife and son and it brings me to tears. I am going to fight this to the bitter end. This has been the hardest fee days of my life the first mistake I made was googling (DO NOT DO) and it just raised my feat to max level. I have never cried so much in my life. I feel fine I don't have any symptoms except one and it's recent that it's hard to use tge bathroom. My doctor said that if I have lymphoma which he sees in alot of young adults that its very cureable. I would like to know if this is the same doctors have to others who are in my situation or have some of you guys been able to beat tgis when its the worse case scenario.I would love to hear stories of people being in my situation and beating this dang cancers butt. I am really broken right now and I just need to hear stories of other surviors and people currently in treatment on what to expect. I would also like to know what questions I should be asking my doctor and what treatments I should be asking him about when they come up with my plan. I apologize for my messy Grammer and paragraph I've just been having a hard time. Can anyone relate to my situation? *UPDATE BEGINS* I went to a top cancer center in the country and they gave me the best news you could ask for in this situation . Since I wrote this Reddit Post the next day i finally went to my local oncologist and he pretty much told me essentially he could give me several extra years it was devastating my wife started crying and panicking. I didn't accept that as my fate so I started to talk to people in colontown and doing research on everything I could know about the top places to get treatment. The 10 following 10 days were the worse 10 days ever no words can describe the fear and hopelessness I felt. I just turned 36 a month prior, not growing old with my wife who I have been with since she was 18 and I was 19. I always thought what life would be like when I get old with my wife grayed but still my beautiful wife.How it would be like seeing my son grow and guiding him to manhood. Then seeing my Son grown up and married bringing over my grandkids what that would be like. Now I was told that wasn't going to happen. asked God to guide me and give me wisdom that I make the right call as this is a actual life saving or ending decision. Stay locally and enjoy the last bit of time I have left (immediately discarded because I'm never give up) Next choice was this place in Arizona which does unique style of treatment and highly thought of and innovative cancer canter . After a few days of deeply considering it I said no to thst one. (Felt like they sell snake oil. Next was the most recommended place in my region recommended to me. I said no to this one as well, just something in me felt uneasy with this place (didnt help my local oncologist did his residency there) even though they are considered by many as the pinnacle of cancer center treatment and advancement . Couldn't do it. Now on to my final choice,the one I said yes to. This cancer center is considered as 1B to the previous mention hospital. This cancer center for whatever reason made something to the very depths of my soul scream, ""THESE GUYS WILL SAVE YOU ,DUMMY. Still I was on the fence mostly because it was on the other side of the country the which means leaving my beloved wife and two year old for several months potentially. This is a fight for my existence I was going to do whatever it takes. Then randomly out the blue I had a guy dm me from reddit or the FB groups (don't remember which) we start talking and we both had similar demographics the same average age, sex and diagnosis. Immediately after a few moments and he talks about where he got treated and immediately names the exact center I felt so strongly would save me. Starts telling me he went with 2 other guys with the same demographic as us (sex,age,gender,diagnosis) and that all 3 of them are little over 3 years NeD. After hearing that my top pick got my 3 new friends NeD bout made me immediately start making arrangements to get treated at this place no matter what. The trip there was a nightmare, I broke my toe. I missed the connecting flight. Airline lost all my luggage so i had nothing other than whats in my back pack. I get to a hotel at 12 am to check out at 4 am to go to the airport at 4 pm that same day. I still has to drive to the hotel I booked which was the most reasonably priced and closest to the treatment facility and get booked. Then arrive to my hotel and they.canceled my reservation because I was a day late to to check in. They finally fixed my reservations(took a hour or so to resolve this. I got to my room and I only had a 40 mins until my appointment with the new oncologist. I really felt like something or someone was trying to do everything it could do to make sure I missed that appointment. I swear I really felt evil forces are stopping me. I sat in the room for 25mins before I had to leave and go to my oncology appointment and I sat so hopeless, thinking about not going and felt that that I was just going to hear the same outcome my local oncologist gave me. A death sentence. My appointment was for a 90 mins with the 3 oncologist on my treatment team. I told them how I stumbled upon this diagnosis BTW I dont think I mentioned in the original post that my Uncle dying suddenly at a young age from heart attack put my ass in to gear to get my heart check. Heart disease is rampant in my family which is why I've been exercising days since i was 20. So back to my appointment, I finishing talking so the 1st thing my doctors said to me was that after reviewing my scans and my the entire case he said this, "" I reviewed what everything your local oncologist records on your diagnosis, treatment, scans and what would be my ultimate fate. They fully DISAGREEED! They said with full confidence in their voices that I was going to live and that im not going to die! That i was going to eliminated the cancer and the chances of reoccurence rates for the plan they laid out for me was less that 6. That very moment the doubt, fear, misery, apathy I felt since my diagnosis all disappeared. I felt my my life breath back into me and pure determination. For the Doctor tell me what he said with the assurance and that I was going to be cancer free is very rare. Doctors don't deal in absolutes unless they TRULY % confident about your treatment outcome. The doctors said that I could be treated by them from my home state. I would just do telehealth visits and the new cancer team will meditate my treatment plan and my local oncologist will implement my new teams plan and do whatever they need. One recommendedation I want to give before I end this is post is that whatever your diagnosis is get the opinion of a top 5 hospital/oncologist/surgeons. One of the reasons the top 5 cancer centers are the cream of the crop is because their technology is far more advanced, their funding is unrivaled, all the top doctors/surgeons/ radiation Drs want to work there and do work at those places. If you have been given bad news,depressed, or you just feel hopelessn. don't be I have met many and i mean MSNY people with way worse diagnosis and who have been told they're terminal some told more than that more than once. Yet they didn't give up found a top cancer center or Doctor that gets them Ned and are still . I want to stress this again, do not play with your life or let your fate be decided by some mid level doctor or hospital.",reddit

I was lucky to have so much time to think this over, time really does help to accept the inevitable. We all know it's coming someday. It just comes sooner for some. People say I'm pretty zen considering the circumstances and I'd say it is an accurate assessment. I certainly wouldn't be this zen if I had just learned I had cancer AND a few weeks to live at the same time. I knew every step of the way my chances were very slim and my oncologists were very honest about it. I'm not saying it's a walk in the park either, I have serious pain issues, I'm heavily medicated and I try to beat into submission that stupid feeling of guilt for making people who love me feel sad. No, it's not your fault you have cancer, but you feel like the bearer of bad news all the time and that can take its toll. I usually just tell my SO my brain is trying to make me feel guilty today and she makes it go away with a kind word and a hug.

This is the internet after all and we like lists! * *I surround myself with people who make me feel good* Not all of your friends and loved ones will react well to your situation and that's ok, we all have our strength and weaknesses. Identify those who make you feel good when you hang out with them instead of those who will leech your energy without even meaning to. Let them deal with their emotions, they got plenty more time and energy to spend than you. * *I feel blessed every day that I have the time to say goodbye instead of leaving everyone suddenly by surprise* I'm a young adult, statistically, I should die of a suicide or a sudden car crash, not of cancer. I feel so blessed that I have the time to plan my funeral, to write letters to loved ones, to say the things that matter and offer loved ones that opportunity as well. I think this is much preferable to the alternative, but I've met others with terminal cancer who say they would have prefered to die instantly by surprise so maybe I'm the exception. * *I've already been dead for a few billion years, and it wasn't too bad* As you can guess from this I don't believe in an afterlife at all. For me dying is a return to the state I was in before my birth. The year isn't very scary to me even if I did not exist. The year isn't very scary to me for the same reasons. Non-existence is my standard state except for that small blimp of life I will have been blessed to experience over the universe's lifespan. Maybe this is a scary concept to some but it brings me comfort. * *I accept I have absolutely no control over the progress of my illness* I know some people have a need for the illusion of control, but the truth is that apart from eating well, sleeping sufficiently, doing you chemo/treatment, getting a bit of exercise even if it's just walking and making the effort to have a social life, all of these when possible, then you're already doing everything you can. Give yourself a pat on the back and try to accept that things will happen whether you like it or not, so try to enjoy the ride even if you're not the one driving. * *I have little time, it is precious, but I must accept my energy is limited and I have the right to rest without feeling guilty* I can't let the feeling that I'm somehow wasting time if I Netflix and chill take over. I have little time, yes, but I have a right to use some of that time to relax without feeling guilty. My body and mind need rest and I need a sense of normality. * *I give myself small goals and projects* If I just wait passively for death, then I feel like it's wasted time. Even if I probably just have a few weeks at most, then I'll find a small project to accomplish during that time that I can realistically accomplish and be proud of. In my case, it's writing one goodbye letter to every person I love and making a video montage for my funeral. For me, productive time is a happy time, especially knowing it will bring joy to loved ones. * *I've lived making sure I'd regret nothing and I'm surrounded by loved ones* Now, this part is the one that helps me the most but It can be too late for the first part and you may have no control over the loved ones part. I'm lucky that my grandfather told me on his deathbed when I was 16 that when I'd be dying I wouldn't regret my mistakes but instead the things I never tried but would have wanted to accomplish. I took that advice to heart and applied it every day of my life. Maybe it's too late for you to apply that advice, but it makes my incoming death a hell of a lot easier knowing I have no regrets and wouldn't change a thing in my life apart from cancer. I also understand you don't control if you have a good family and you may not have had the chance to develop good friendships, and I'm sorry if that's the case. There are support groups out there that may help you but I imagine it must be a poor substitute. Having no regrets and being surrounded by loved ones is simply what helps me the most through this. There, I think that covers it. I wish you all the best and if a single element in this list has helped someone out there then I consider this post was worth it. Good luck everyone!",reddit
terminal,"I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer a month after my 29th birthday this year. Mets in liver and lungs. My oncologist told me it’s incurable/ terminal/ inoperable. I had a port placed and stared 5-fu in February. 50% tumor reduction after two months. Then I got sepsis from my port incision not closing properly. Took a month off of chemo. Found out my cancer is a genetic mutation (PMS2) and started a clinical trial. 8 cycles later and the tumor in my colon is 95% gone. The liver and lung mets are shrinking or are stable. I was really positive in the beginning. Despite all the good news, I find myself spiraling. I can’t get over being terminally ill. I just finished my apprenticeship for my dream job in December of . I got a job in my field in January. I thought I was finally going to be living my life the way I have always dreamed. Now I feel like it has been snatched away from me. I can’t work often because I’m in bed 90% of the time. I don’t know if I’ll live long enough to get married or achieve any of my career goals. I know no one can tell me for certain if I’ll live to see 40 or even 31, but I just need some encouragement from people who are going through this too.

terminal,"Hello everyone. I sincerely apologise for the morbid post but I suppose given that this is a cancer subreddit, you’re gonna see that kinda stuff. I’m a 20 year old female struggling with breast cancer, but I was only diagnosed about roughly 7 months ago ? I can’t really remember anymore. My cancer had been progressed to stage 3 by the time I figured out, but my oncologists let me know that because I’m young and healthy I’ll have a good shot. Well. that’s not really the case anymore. As I mentioned I was diagnosed at stage 3 but I’m on the brink of Stage 4/terminal now. I haven’t seen an ounce of progress since I started chemo, and before you ask I’ve tried multiple different treatments or “cocktails. I am feeling worse every day, and I can see my fellow team at a loss of what to do. I’ve had a few close calls regarding death and I feel very scared that my time is up, especially with being so young and I have so many dreams. Everybody talks about the physical aspects of cancer (nausea, hair loss, fatigue) but never the emotional. Never in my life have I been sucked into such a depressive state, and it’s agonising watching the people around me have to witness all of this. I want to make my family smile again, I want to travel the world and graduate university. I want to get married and I want to have kids, but knowing all of that won’t happen is just very upsetting. I don’t understand. I am an incredibly healthy person and always took care of myself and everything that I do, I’ve never smoked, never done drugs, rarely ever drink, and all that. I just spend so much time dwelling on the “why” aspect of this stuff which I don’t think is very healthy. I’m just posting this to see if anyone can relate and maybe I can reach others who are going through the same thing and we can lean on each other for some support )",reddit

terminal,"Hi guys. I had my last round of chemo a week and a half ago. My doctor is fairly confident I am in remission. In January within 4 weeks of having symptoms I was diagnosed at 28 with primary mediastinal B-cell non-hodgkins lymphoma stage 1 which affects people from 15 to 44 and they do not know why it affects young people. But I was close to stage 2. I feel like since I got diagnosed due to the RE-POC regimen I went through and how strong it was I was just going through the motions. My mom, boyfriend, and his parents really stepped up and took care of me and I will forever be indebted to them. But now that’s it’s done and everyone keeps telling I’m cancer free and everything can go back to normal now! But nothing feels normal anymore to me. I honestly don’t even know what is normal. In and out of the hospital feeling like my body was giving out on me and I couldn’t control it. The countless amount of pain and mentally wanting to give up due do how strong my symptoms were. The first three treatments not knowing if the medicine would work were so damn scary. I pushed forward because 6months before I was diagnosed my 10 year old autistic nephew passed away from radiation complications and if he went through what he went through I could go through chemo. Some days I feel so guilty I survived and he didn’t. I miss him so much and so does my family. I felt guilty when I got diagnosed of us having to go through cancer again so soon after even though I knew I couldn’t control it. I have always been so positive and the funny one. But mentally I’m not doing well secretly. How do you go back to normal after this? It’s hard accepting what I just went through and how this will always be apart of my journey. I fear of getting cancer again having to go through it again or worse being terminal. People think the second you finish your last round of chemo it’s done, but it’s not. I’m still having symptoms and my doctor said it could take up to 6 months for the chemo to get out of my body. I originally was going to be purchasing a house at the end of the year with my boyfriend and start a family next year. But I’m not sure if I can even have kids now from what I’ve been told. We didn’t have enough time to freeze my eggs and I’m slowly dying inside at that. I want to be a mother so badly and I wanted to find someone who I believed was the right person. If that was stolen from me by cancer I don’t know how I will react. Sorry this is so long I needed to rant a little. I am grateful I’m alive with a future ahead of me. But getting diagnosed changed everything around me so much and it changed me. I just want to be happy and to be adventurous carefree me again. Thanks for listening💙",reddit

I'm sick of people around me - even my doctors who I previously really felt cared for me - seeming to genuinely think I'm the crazy one for not being super happy about living for like, years. that's what I keep hearing. ""sometimes people live 15 years with this"" well great lol. I'm just past 2. so in 13 more I will be 35. why do people think maybe living 15 years is something amazing? or at least not something I get to massively grieve over for a while? would you be happy to be told your child would best case, die in years? would you Not worry constantly? with my disease it's constant posts about 50+ people dying and how tragic it is for others (not the patient, rarely mentioned) and I am reminded that the victim is apparently everyone around me and I should be happy to live to a fraction of their age. like whatever, I'm really gonna try to enjoy whatever I get. but it's hard and I am so sick and tired of people acting like me living to half my parents' current age would be some happy story. especially when everyone around me gets to say it as a tragedy. I get people don't want to encourage a patient to be depressed and mad at the world but I constantly feel like it only matters how everyone else feels. countless times I've searched things like 'coping with terminal illness' 'coping with GBM' etc. and half if not most of the results are for people to cope with my existence and suffering. it sucks being aware of the fact that you're not the center of your suffering, apparently. and I'm not fighting anything, ffs. I'm not going to lose my battle. I don't have great knowledge in experimenting with different diseases and dna and genes and creating new vaccines and chemotherapy. a diet won't get rid of my tumor. this isn't some fight I'm in it's something shitty that happened to me. that is happening to me. and I wish people sometimes would just acknowledge it instead of being so toxic positive while they're allowed to cry about my death and suffering and whatever. edit: I don't really have the energy to reply to everyone atm because yeah tired lol but thank you so much for reading and ur words. it really does mean something that not everyone thinks I'm crazy or whatever.",reddit
terminal,"another post about it but oh well, I'm tired and hurting both physically and mentally first: I'm tired of people acting like death will be brought on by a lack of ""positivity"" and ""a fighting spirit"" it's bad science. I want to be happier for myself, not optimistic all the time because of a pseudoscientific idea that it will cure my terminal illness. and this has just been on my mind, maybe it's just me noticing it but I feel like lately there's been a lot of this idea that there's ""always a treatment option"" and it's just not true for some of us, I wish people would respect that. to me, being positive is telling myself that my doctors are working daily on trying to keep me alive longer some of us have had second opinions and some with third and fourth and fifth and the result will be the same. of course I get helping out new patients because healthcare is a stressful meess but some of us are stage or grade 4 or have rare cancers etc. and don't have a multitude of treatments available. I feel a bit crazy trying to explain some people really are terminal but. we are. I haven't given up, of course I hope there will be something that works for me. but I feel caught in this crazy place where I don't check for support specifically about my diagnosis because it is filled with caregivers lamenting about how horrifying it is to even watch; but fear talking about it myself because people will tell me that there's actually something that can be done, even if there isn't. when people live ten years with what I have, they get articles written about them in the local papers & on the MD Anderson website. I go to a good research hospital, and would've had the same treatment there; you cut it out and hope like hell it doesn't come back, hope when it does you can cut it out again. there are some options but the average survival is still honestly fucking terrible. I am not laying down and dying because a doctor told me to - I am trying to accept what's happening to me, and that has been a long and painful process. it's been hard to be a bit graceful about it and not want to try and scream about how unfair it is all the time but believe it or not, I've made a fair amount of progress from where I used to be. I just wish people would try to empathize with how much it takes to go through that mentally, on top of all the physical side effects, rather than discounting it with endless false hope which ends up feeling like an accusation, really. valium i took earlier is kicking in so idk what else, sorry/thanks if you read this lol",reddit

I should also say that I live with my parents since I was diagnosed so my living costs are pretty low. I’ve decided that I like clocks.

I’m up to 14 clocks so I guess I’m considered a collector now. They are on the wall at the end of my bed and seeing them constantly makes me very happy. I’ve recently decided I love parrots. Not the real ones, but the wooden carved ones and the paper mâché painted ones that sit on a hoop. I don’t know why I like them other than they make me happy.

terminal,"Doctors were quite unclear and due to the fast paced nature of my wifes (39 F) diagnosis - rushed to hospital with pain and puking to discover it wasn't her gallstone causing it as doctors had always said but a T4 tumor, operated on the next morning etc. Sorry if I have not given enough detail but we recently got the first PET scan results and were told the doctors were ""unsure"" if they can cure this. They have suggested heavy form of Chemo for first 3 months to see if it can be shrunk. They mentioned a potential operation but advised against as it's very dangerous (cancer is near main artery in abdomen. So there advice seems to be to try shrink it via chemo to increase survival time but to not operate or intend to cure it?

Anyone else experienced this form of cancer spread or know someone who has? We see a lot of survival stage 4 colon cancer stories but almost all are from people who had it spread to the liver or lungs and could be operated on without as much risk. We don't know what to think given there is a potential operation but it's just dangerous and possibly a last resort?

I am in so much pain today, ironically, that I will definitely not be doing it again. The pain is so bad. It's so much worse than the pain I had it to relieve, and although I've been told that this pain is temporary (but not how long for) it is definitely not worth it. With every passing moment the pain gets worse. I felt I had to post just because of the ridiculousness of it. This is so, so much worse than the pain it is supposed to reduce.

terminal,"Just wanted to post an update as I couldn't find a way of updating my original post, thank you so much for all your care and responses, I owe you all an update at the very least ❤ Update: I called an ambulance in the end and was given enough meds to tranquilize a horse and taken to hospital. I've been on a lot of morphine since then, I'm still in hospital on a 24hr morphine driver. Plus some steroids etc. The pain had spread down to my left hip and now my left leg is gradually developing pins and needles and going numb. I think in a few days I will have lost sensation to my left leg and foot completely ( and of course with my spinal pain not being improved I can't ditch the morphine driver and go home. There's no going home on the cards at all rn, I've been moved to a room that's not on a specific ward so my care can be handled 'on a palliative basis. I wish, wish, wish I hadn't had that radiotherapy, I would do anything to go back and change that, I wish I had had more information and more time, although even then I would probably have trusted in my oncologist and gone for it anyway tbf. Their explanation at this point is that it's probably a pain-flare reaction. I don't know if/how that explains the nerve damage to my left hip/leg. Or if pain flares are usually that bad, or go on for so long. But here I am, I will openly admit I've just been saying the cheeriest 'goodnights' I could type to my various family members on Skype, as I do every night, and I'm crying. I really wish I could just pick up my morphine driver and go home ❤ Update 2: still in hospital, back on oral Zomorph plus Pregabalin and dexamethasone, pain is roughly back to normal (meh) unless I move around a lot; as soon as I have some reassurance from my consultant that this pain-flare thing has passed, and I'm not likely to have another sudden major pain event, I'm going to go home, that could have been tomorrow (Wednesday) if my consultant had been round today but she hasn't, so I doubt it will be until Thursday now 🙄 Thanks for all your input and love, I really appreciate it at tough confusing times when I'm lost and don't understand what's happening ❤",reddit
terminal,"Hello, We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have. Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help. Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers/personal information you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. If you would like to take part, please click the following link.

About a year ago I underwent a second round of radiation to try to slow the growth of the cancer, which was starting to resist the immunotherapy treatment that I was on. It did not help. Last winter I went back on chemotherapy in hopes that it would slow the cancer. After four months of that, it was still growing. So, as a last ditch attempt to get ahead of the growth, I was offered this other chemo treatment that only has a % chance of helping at all. It came with hair loss, bleeding and generally feeling like shyte for another three months, in hopes of it giving me another three months. I have declined this treatment. I am still able to swallow most foods. I realize that this is my last summer and I want to make the most of it. So, in leu of the treatment, the oncologist is referring me to a surgeon to have a stint inserted in my esophagus at some point, to allow food to pass the tumour.

terminal,"In my quest to dump USAA insurance, I reached out to a broker…this was her reply. Hello, I hope you are doing well today. I wanted to share some insights on the state of the insurance industry and the factors driving the premium adjustments you might see in your renewals this year. Unfortunately, this is an industry-wide issue that many consumers are seeing. The truth is that no matter where you live, certain factors have disrupted the market, leading to rising rates and difficulty finding coverage. Factors leading to the disruption include: Higher rebuilding costs: The cost to rebuild your home is up dramatically due to the rising cost of materials and labor. The supply chain for materials also continues to be an issue. We can all agree that everything has gone up in price. Carriers simply can’t survive paying these higher prices without charging more themselves. Higher vehicle repair costs: The cost to repair your car is up 20% due to the rising cost of auto parts and labor to fix your car. In addition, parts in vehicles now include some technology features, which are harder and more expensive to repair. Severe auto accidents: Accidents are way up post-COVID, along with auto fatalities resulting in higher litigation and medical costs. The good news is there are some things you can do to help you weather the current insurance market. Here are a few to keep in mind: Don’t let your policy cancel or lapse. Unfortunately, carriers are not reinstating coverage as easily as they once did. If your policy lapses, they may require your premium in full before reinstating—or, depending on the carrier’s risk assessment, your policy could even be canceled. This is across the board for every line of coverage, so make sure to pay your premiums on time or in advance just to be safe. Consider higher deductibles. This is not a good idea for everyone, but in some cases, it can make sense. If you’re interested, I’m happy to discuss whether it makes sense for your specific situation. Don’t overlook tenure. Switching companies too often can hurt you in the long run. In addition, some carriers won’t take you as a new client if you have less than two years with a carrier or have filed a significant number of claims in the past. Absorb small claims when you're able and save for catastrophic losses. Claim frequency is a huge factor in your coverage rates. Keep your home well-maintained. Yard debris or overhanging trees can cause premiums to increase or policies to non-renew. Regular maintenance can help prevent potential issues that might lead to insurance claims. I hope this provides context for what is happening in the insurance marketplace. As always, reach out if you have questions or want to discuss this or other related topics.",reddit
terminal,"Army veteran James Powers loses out on about $1, a month because of how the federal government calculates his veteran disability benefits. “That’s money that could be getting my kids into baseball or basketball or dozens of other activities that could improve our quality of life” Powers said. “We’ve got enough money to survive, so I’m lucky that way. But after the military, we shouldn’t just be thinking about surviving. It should be about helping veterans thrive” Powers traveled from Ohio to take part in a rally outside the Capitol Tuesday in support of the Major Richard Star Act, legislation that could provide a windfall of disability payouts to nearly 50, veterans. More than advocates took part in the event, pushing for renewed action on the long- stalled bill. Advocates say the money is intended to establish a more fair process for how the government handles compensation for individuals injured during their time in the ranks. “Our veterans cannot afford to continue losing their full earned military retirement pay because Congress insists on saving money at their expense” said Tim Peters, an Air Force veteran and state adjutant for the Montana Veterans of Foreign Wars. “It’s objectively wrong” The legislation has been a top priority of veterans advocates for several years and passed out of the House Armed Services Committee last summer. But it has been stalled in the House and Senate since then, in part because of cost concerns, and in part because of general congressional inaction in recent months. Named for an Army veteran who died from cancer complications in , the measure deals with how veterans’ disability benefits are classified under federal statute. Since , veterans forced to retire early from the military because of injuries receive both their full military retirement pay and full disability benefits if they have a disability rating of at least 50. The combined total of the two benefits can amount to several thousand dollars each month. But veterans in the same situation who have a disability rating of less than 50% are subject to dollar- for-dollar offsets under federal rules. That means that officials subtract several hundred or several thousand dollars each month from individuals receiving the disability support, leaving a gap in their income. Navy veteran Bob Carey, executive director of the National Defense Committee, said the practice costs him $ a month. “I’ve had my disability rating since . So that’s , I’ve lost over the years because the federal government says, ‘You don’t need all that money” he said. “And we’re the only federal employees who have our retirement reduced that way” Members of The Military Coalition echoed that sentiment, pledging the efforts of their 35 organizations in getting the measure passed this year. Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont, and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, joined Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla, at the rally in supporting the bill, but also acknowledged that more pressure will need to be put on their colleagues to force the measure to move forward. “This is long past time” Tester told the cheering crowd. “We’ve got 70 co-sponsors in the Senate … We need to make sure leadership puts this on the floor” Lawmakers said the most likely route for congressional passage is inclusion in the annual defense authorization bill, currently being crafted by the House and Senate Armed Services Committee. Advocates have about two months to convince members to do that. If not, the measure could pass as a stand-alone bill, but congressional infighting has scuttled all but a few non-essential measures in recent months.",reddit

terminal,"By Gen. T. Michael Moseley (ret) November 1, Defense News ( On Saturday, Israeli F-35 stealth fighter aircraft penetrated highly defended Iranian airspace, struck a broad number of military targets and returned home safe. Days earlier, U.S. B-2 stealth bombers struck multiple deeply buried Houthi arms caches. These missions illustrate a key point: Despite trendy arguments to the contrary, the United States still requires the most advanced fighters and bombers in our arsenal if we want to win in future conflicts. Questioning the value of modern combat aircraft is not new within the Washington defense arena. Some observers of Russia-Ukraine fighting in trenches extrapolate that small drones are changing the nature of air warfare. However, these assertions ignore the fact that the drones’ impact is largely isolated to tactical Army ground operations, not on air warfare. Infantry and armor cannot move without being targeted by drones. Ukrainian fighter aircraft moving at miles an hour are not affected. While it is appropriate to recognize the impact of small drones in the battlespace, it is also crucial to be clear-eyed about the scale and scope of that potential. Quadcopters did nothing to prevent the Russia-Ukraine war from descending into a withering slog. Conditions for that type of fight were set when neither side secured air superiority. The U.S. must bear this in mind with extreme care as it prepares for a potential fight against China. Deterring adversaries requires a successful plan and the requisite means to defeat them. This starts with the ability to control the air in times and places necessary to execute conventional strategic attack of key enemy centers of gravity, such as war material production, logistics, command leadership, control centers, communications, power generation and supply depots. An opponent cannot sustain a fight if their means to execute it are paralyzed or negated. This is why the stealthy penetrating B-21 bomber is so important. Fighters like the F-35 and F-22 secure air superiority over enemy territory and U.S. forces while adding to strike capacity. The Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) advanced stealth fighter working in conjunction with uninhabited Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) will take these mission capabilities to new heights. Anyone questioning the importance of these critical airpower missions should review recent headlines. Consider the recent B-2 strike in Yemen. After months of intercepting Houthi missiles targeting international shipping in a reactionary, whack-a-mole fashion, the Biden administration finally sought to eliminate a source of these attacks by striking arms caches buried in hardened underground facilities. B-2s have the unique ability to carry weapons large enough to destroy these protective measures while also harnessing their stealth to avoid enemy threats. A swarm of quadcopters would be useless in this attack. Range, payload and survivability matter.",reddit

terminal,"I need help on how to help my daughter. My daughter is 7 and has ADHD and pretty severe anxiety. It took me until she was 5 before I realized that anxiety was causing her to be afraid of people, not simply being shy.it was holding her back from experiences that she wanted to do, but was terrified once we got there. She is doing better with a combination of horse therapy, dance and acro (especially for the ADHD wiggles, and medication. None on their own did the trick, but together, it really helps. However, she has extreme, angry, meltdown reactions when people she doesn't know need to know her info. Examples: Picking up her prescription, they need to know her name and birthday. Checking in for an appointment for her. They need that info. She hears me calling to check on literally anything for her. This weekend, we had someone from the electric company come do am evaluation on our home to reduce the cost. They needed all of our names to qualify. Every single time, full meltdown, saying they don't need to know her info. She reacts the same if we go to the dr. We literally can't get her a physical. She's just terrified and full freak out happens. Even when she's even keeled and doing well, this happens. I try and speak to her when she's not triggered, but no luck. We are trying to find therapy for her, we've been trying for 3 yrs, and I have called at least 30 places. They either don't take our insurance, she's too young or too old, they're not taking on new patients.one had availability, but virtual only, and it was traditional talk therapy. No way was she going to do that. Anyone else with a kid with anxiety over people knowing their info? Any tips?",reddit

Some years better/worse than others. Autoimmune crud was speculated years ago, but didn't show in labs. However, in case it adds to the puzzle that is me: I had scarlet fever 3 times (ages 6,12,18; meningitis when I was 31. And have had chronic Epstein Barr since I was 33. I was diagnosed with EDS at 45, finally. And all kinds of gut related issues (SIBO, gastroparesis, gerd, nausea, MCAS, plus IC, rosacea, migraines, chronic fatigue. Add in late diagnosis of ADHD, and prone to depression and anxiety. In , the annoying, often very painful, 'rosacea ' appeared as a nasty malar rash.which led to testing and a diagnosis of early stages lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. No apparent joint damage. I started on hydroxychloroquine, and within 2 months, the hair loss stopped, pain and extreme fatigue lessened. After less than a year, EVERYTHING flared back up. Skin, pain, fatigue, hair loss, all of it. My old rheum said there was nothing else to do, but I was miserable. It took a long time, but I got in with a new, better, more progressive rheum. Initially, my lupus labs showed that the hydroxychloroquine was helping those numbers. My RA factor was still high. Still no autoimmune joint damage, but definite arthritis. The rheum said that while my labs weren't bad, she said that they're not % accurate % of the time, and that I am clearly, incredibly inflamed and need help. She pointed out the on-going low-level malar rash, very swollen hands and fingers, swollen knees and shoulders. She said that I am not ready/don't need meds like Saphnelo or Benlysta yet. She wanted to add methotrexate and folic acid, to what I am already doing. 4 weeks of hell. 3 of those were oral doses, the 4th was injection (I posted about that experience last week, was so much worse. Despite greatly increasing the folic acid and lots of Zofran, I was miserable. It is not up for debate, I am absolutely not taking methotrexate any more. Nope. So, I keep hearing about the wonders of biologics for inflammation and improved life quality. I am concerned that with my current labs looking fine (likely due to the hydroxychloroquine, and despite the rheum acknowledging my extreme inflammation, I won't be offered anything to help. Please share ideas on how to definitely be validated, or questions to ask that would get me to lead the conversation well.

terminal,"I've got MCAS, diagnosed several years ago. For added fun, I have EDS, SIBO, IC, chronic EBV, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Ever since the roller coaster of SIBO, 10 yrs ago, I have struggled with my weight. At first, I couldn't keep weight on for anything. Then, in one month I gained 8 lbs, and within a year, 50lbs. All while eating very, very little. I learned that I have 2 types of SIBO, one causes weight loss, the other to gain. Add to all of that MCAS and autoimmune disease, and getting my body in balance is damn hard. I avoid all trigger foods that set off various symptoms. No, I am not on a fully low histamine diet, as I spent years low histamine, and low fodmap, completely careful, and felt awful. So, I just avoid foods that make me miserable. Oh, and I don't eat processed foods, don't do much salt or sugar. So, I am working with an EDS dr who is also a specialist in MCAS. She put me on the following protocol about 20 months ago: Oral cromolyn sodium, 4x daily Oral ketotifen, 2x daily Claritin, 3x daily Famotidine, 1x daily It definitely helps the belly MCAS symptoms, although I have had a lot of nausea in recent months. I can % say that the cromolyn sodium and ketotifen are essential for me. I've been reading that Claritin and Zyrtec can screw with your metabolism. I am curious if anyone has any experience in this? Partly out of curiosity. Partly because before this protocol, I had finally lost 8 lbs and kept it off for a few months.then it came back. Add to it: I ran out of Claritin a week ago, so I started taking Zyrtec, because my dr said that was fine, and I am up 4 lbs, and my face is puffy. All to end with: if you struggle to lose weight, and found success, what helped most? I already workout, get the protein I need, hydrate, don't eat processed foods, my calories are decent ( avg, I have worked with an amazing dr to get ALL hormones and thyroid in check.

I was diagnosed when I was 27 and fought it with surgeries, chemo, radiation, the whole works. In February they told me I have about a year or two left. After weeks and weeks of trying to wrap my brain around the thought of dying before I really got to do the things in life that most people want, I managed to stop panicking, calm down, and I started to think about how I want my last years to go by, and how I want people to remember me. So I was wondering, if you do make more Monster Sanctuary, could you add me to the game as an NPC, or maybe as a keeper you can fight and if you beat me I give the players an egg that they can't get anywhere else? I don't know how long it'll be before we see more Monster Sanctuary, but I have a lot of friends that I've convinced to play this game and they've fallen in love with it too. So it'd be really cool if they could see me in the game after I'm gone. Anyways, even if the answer is no, thanks for reading my story. And guys, get your butts checked by a doctor. You are never too young to be sure. Don't end up like me.",reddit

terminal,"My friend and I just moved out of an apartment unit last week. I heard nothing about the damage deposit, so I sent a text and they told us we won't be getting it back. They said they had to spend a whole day cleaning after we left, and that my cats destroyed the curtains that came with the unit, which means we won't see any of the $ we paid. I mean I won't argue about the living room curtains being damaged, but the curtains in both bedrooms were untouched. I had replaced mine with darker curtains when we moved in and stored the default ones in a closet, and my roommate never once allowed a cat into his bedroom due to his allergies. As for the cleaning, how is that even calculated? They didn't hire cleaners so like can they even charge us with that? We cleaned the unit to roughly the state it was in when we moved in. Maybe we missed some spots but it's not like we left a huge mess. Feels like they're just trying to screw us over, but I'm obviously biased. Is there anything we can do?

Sometimes I just want to open the fridge and pull out a drink that I can have immediately without cleaning a blender.

terminal,"Been at St. Boniface for the last week (turns out chemo and covid is a bad mix. I swear the things I hear elders say to the people trying to treat them is absolutely horrible! The man in the other bed in my room for example. Spends all day yelling at nurses and complaining that they won't let him go home with a urine infection. Earlier today I heard this conversation: ""Alright, here's your antibiotics"" ""I don't want any pills"" ""But then how are you supposed to get better"" ""You can take those pills and shove them up your ass"" ""That's not very nice to say to a lady"" ""You're no lady"" Then he proceeded to start swearing until she just decided to leave the room. Meanwhile I'm laying in bed and I feel awful for this poor person just trying to do their job. Like bruh, shut up and do as you're told and you'll get to go home. Then there's this banshee down the hall constantly switching between screaming and crying. Every single waking moment all I hear is ""BooohoobooohoohoooAAAAAAAAAAAHHHboohoohooo"" as she asks for help but then starts screaming ""DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME"" like she's being waterboarded whenever a nurse tries to help her. I don't know how many rooms away she is but even with our door closed I can hear all this through the god damn walls. And those are just a couple examples of what I've experienced so far, and it's always been patients who are 50+ years old. Does reaching a certain age mean you suddenly are allowed to disrespect everyone around you? I swear, the people who work here and deal with shit like this every day are both insane and absolute saints.

terminal,"Hey y’all I figured I’d ask here if anyones had the same thing happen, I’ve googled and so far come up with not that much relevant information. I’m also seeing my therapist next week so regardless of what the deal is, I’m getting to the bottom of it. So here’s the story. The other day I went to dinner with my SO and we had a LOT to drink after. I didn’t do any other drugs and I haven’t for quite some time now, however I am under active cancer treatment so I receive both radiation and chemo (don’t even know if that’s relevant but anyway. When we get home we get into a bit of an argument but we end it off nicely and he goes into the kitchen. When he returns (I’m in the hallway) it gets weird. All I remember is a feeling of absolute dread, I’m scared he is gonna hurt me, I remember him being extremely aggressive and screaming very hurtful things at me. I start to cry a lot and I just hold my hands over my face as I don’t know what to do. He leaves again. When he comes back I exclaim “don’t come near me” as I’m fucking scared at this point. He is all confused and doesn’t understand what happened. He proceeds to tell me that this part about him screaming etc never happened. I’m so confused. I’ve never had anything like this happen before. I go to bed completely shattered. When I wake up the next morning I wonder if I maybe have had some sort of psychotic episode? It was just that moment, it can’t have lasted more than a couple minutes but it felt like longer. I don’t drink every day or even more than once a week, most often less. I wouldn’t say I have an issue with alcohol but this incident has me so scared I definitely won’t be touching it for a while, and absolutely not in large amounts. This is something I’ll talk over with my therapist as well to hear her opinion and make a game plan cus fuck that shit. It’s worth mentioning that I’ve been in a relationship with my bf for 5 years, we’ve lived together for 4, we have two lovely cats together and we both make decent salaries, however I’m on % sick leave at the moment. I have been a total cunt in the past when I’ve gotten very drunk and I think I’m starting to realize that’s an actual issue I need to sort out regardless, but something like this has never happened before. Does any of this sound familiar to any of you? I’d take anything honestly because it’s seriously freaky. EDIT: I am in my late 20s. I’m otherwise a healthy female who eats normally, only so drugs for fun far in between (last time I did any was in mid December. I have been depressed once in my life before but I was never medicated, that’s 5 years ago. Never had any depressed episodes, thoughts etc. since then.

terminal,"Hi everyone! I’ve had my Bengal for 7 years (he’s 8. He’s a neutered male. I know it’s a common issue but I am at my wits end here - he is peeing in corners, on doors, on the floor, in the shower, really anywhere but where we want him to. He’s so so sneaky about it as well, it’s like he knows he’s not supposed to! My partner and I have combatted this ever since we got him and we thought we finally were rid the issue as he hadn’t peed inside for 2 years after we moved houses. But now he has seemly recently taken up the habit once again. He is not stressed, there’s nothing physically wrong with him (multiple vet trips have proved that. He gets a lot of attention, play and mental stimulation. I have tried pheromones, lots and lots of litter boxes, moving litter boxes, all types of litter under the sun, taking him for walks outside (which seemed to actually worsen the problem. We cannot let him roam free outside as we live in a big city with lots of cars and he would surely get himself killed. I don’t. Know. What. To. Do. I am so utterly frustrated. This is the number 1 source of the fights I have with my partner and it’s such a sore topic at this stage we can hardly even talk about it anymore. I am so tired of living in the smell of cat pee, the constant fear every time I hear scratch noises, I don’t like having people over because it’s embarrassing, we can’t go on holiday as no one can be put to watching a pissing cat. I love him so much, he’s such a good, smart, little lad. He is affectionate and seems happy and loving. I am worried it’s time to consider rehoming him as we simply can’t live like this anymore? But I can’t bear the thought of that either. I am so lost. Please, please help. I am at my wits end. UPDATE I just had e-consultation with my vet and we discussed some options. She was understanding but also couldn’t give me much advice as we’ve tried so much already. She’s still adamant it’s not a physical problem, as he has been vetted for this already multiple times. He does not show any change or discomfort when urinating. Diet is ok. Anxiety meds were discussed but vet isn’t convinced he’s stressed or anxious. I’ve tried pheromones before. Will try that again. We were referred to a behavior specialist but he’s not currently taking on private clients, I am trying to find someone who can come and meet us in our home and hopefully advise us on what changes we can make to improve the situation.",reddit

I’m currently on enhertu which has shown great effect so far but I’ve only been on it since November. Back then I had been stable on taxol for over a year, but as y’all know things can move incredibly fast and at that time I went from having only bone mets to have it spread to my liver and my brain. I know I still have a few more chemos to try but it’s starting to run low and I’m scared. I’ve been feeling some pain in my hip where my bone mets are most significant and in my liver.

I’m overwhelmed with your kind words and for that I want to say thank you. To those suggesting going to Switzerland/ other countries, it’s an option I’ve looked into. It’s quite expensive and not really something I can afford being on disability. In Belgium and the Netherlands you have to be a registered citizen and it’s quite strict. So sadly, it’s not an option for me. I have a palliative care team and they’re very lovely, but it’s and extent to how comfortable I can be living like this. I’ve simply had enough. I’ve had this disease for years. I hope MAID/ euthanasia will be available worldwide in the distant future. There’s ongoing political discussions now in my country (Norway, so hopefully we’re looking at that possibility- it will happen after I’m gone, though. For anyone worried, I will not go out and buy street drugs or do anything stupid like that. I will also not attempt anything without being absolutely sure it works.

terminal,"Just got my CA’s back from earlier this week, and they have dropped significantly. Obviously, zero is always the goal, but every step forward is a win in my books. On September 1st, my numbers jumped up to 12.4. My most recent was .3. That lifted me up quite a bit yesterday. Still in a ton of pain, and back to having trouble eating, but one step at a time. I have my next immunotherapy treatment Monday, and Tuesday I finally start physical therapy so I can relearn how to walk. Back in the beginning of October, we had found this thing traveled to my brain. We did 10 sessions of full brain radiation. Can’t wait to get in for an mri or ct scan to see if we wiped that out. Just have to wait a bit I guess. Either way, it’s so great getting that glimmer of hope to squeeze and hold on to. I told my oncologist and my radiation oncologist that it’s going to take more that that to stop me, and the only thing that can knock me down at this point is a freight train (well, maybe after the PT so I’m steadier on my feet first) Hope you all get good news like I did!",reddit

In my mind I'm like okay I frag like crazy with an AR, I should run a sub and frag even harder, but usually that's not the case.

I got stuck around the range for probably a month and then I finally broke into the 's and I still felt quite stuck for a very long time around another month. But I remember when I was in the 's I would face 's and get crushed, but then one day I randomly peaked into and haven't dropped out since and all the 's that were roughly equal to me last month feel like easier wins now. Now 's have taken the place of 's being roughly equal. But the thing is is I feel like I haven't even changed really much in my game and in fact I think I might actually be worse at solving puzzles than I was elo before because my puzzle rating is only but it used to be and I feel like I have actually got worse at puzzles. Chess feels like a really hard game to track progress in, like sure you may see your elo raise but I don't actually feel like a different player or anything? When I was elo if I faced a I would just know I was cooked, but now as the player, thinking of facing my old self I wouldn't really feel like I have any edge? IDK MAN IM IN MY HEAD.

terminal,"I'm contemplating the emberlight vs. the scorching bow. It's quite difficult because I know I will get more usage out of the emberlight, but the scorching bow also makes one specific grind quite mindless, that being kril. I haven't done a ton of research on kril and it's various methods outside of the scorching bow method that I saw. So let me say I currently know the 7:0 bandos method with bowfa, and I think I heard there's a bowfa method for kril as well, but if it's not as convenient as the bandos method I cba. I've seen a bit of good points for both options in other threads but I am still unsure. I'm close to 95 slayer so I need the hasta soon, and if I don't get the bow then I will probably stop kril ASAP once I get a hasta, but if I get the bow I will probably stay for all his drops. But outside of the kril grind I'm not aware of any other use for this bow as I already have a bowfa, and I am already shredding td's with demonbane and arclight. So yeah. I guess I'm looking for someone who has experience with the kril grind potentially with and without the bow that can maybe vouch if it's worth sacrificing a synapse to make the grind easier. I plan on doing my greater demon tasks at tds till 99 slayer so I'm sure I'll get more than 1 synapse along the way, but I'm just preparing for when I get my first one, and if I get shit luck following it. Final point: The emerberlight would help me in my cerb tasks as I still need my prims, and it would convince me to start doing my abyssal demon tasks at sire, which would be cool because the abyssal slayer helm is my favorite in the game, so it would help achieve that goal.

terminal,"We know we are chosen by God, so I'm wondering is it possible that God chooses someone to be of the elect, but for whatever reason they never become saved because for example, they never heard the gospel? For example, see 2 Timothy 2:10 ""Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory"" Paul is saying he's okay enduring being persecuted in prison so that he can still help share the gospel to the elect so they may obtain salvation. Does this mean someone may be of the elect but if they never are preached to they may die unsaved? It's biblical God chooses us, but we have to choose him also. Romans 10: ""If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved"" So basically is it possible there are people who are of the elect in say India, or China, Korea etc. that are chosen by God, but since they are raised in non-Christian areas, they may go their entire life without hearing the Gospel and die unsaved? One last question, does this also mean that there is a fixed amount of us elected in the history of life? I could be wrong but I remember hearing that all who are meant to be saved must be saved before something big happens like Christ coming back or something like that idk. It may be somewhere in revelation but I can't find it. Does anyone know what I'm referring to?",reddit
terminal,"I started playing chess 9 months ago and I started playing blitz at elo and I dropped to > . Then I grinded to and couldn't climb past that point after about a month of playing chess. Then I switched to rapid and climbed to in rapid in 1 day, then it took me about a week or two to get past elo. Then about weeks > in rapid. Then I struggled, was the hardest elo I ever had to improve out of, then was not as hard as the previous but still hard, then elo was extremely easy? And now I'm ish and I think I'm underrated I just haven't been playing much rated lately mostly unrated to refine my openings and just simply not playing a lot of chess. Yet every time I play I feel like I have improved since last time I played which makes no sense because I'm not even doing puzzles. I almost feel like the shackles have loosened and I'm playing less static chess and more dynamic chess, where I will make moves like using pawn trades to improve my minor pieces activity, or trading my weaker minors for their stronger more active minors. I'm not rushing to win games, I'm fine playing 50+ moves to grind out a win through positional play etc. But these are all concepts I learnt through watching higher rated players but never knew how to actually execute, but now I feel like it's coming quite natural and I don't even really need to try to improve. Which makes no sense, when I was I put in so many hours watching videos, playing games, grinding puzzles, yet saw little to no improvement, and then randomly things just click and now I feel like I could push if I wanted to quite easily. What are your guy's thoughts? I'm interested to hear some high rated players and see if maybe they had a similar experience? I'm just puzzled by this, it's like I'm putting in the least amount of effort in my chess climb, yet playing the best chess of my life?",reddit

Plus i admit, coming from PS4 to Series X, the game runs so much better and smoother! Here's the sad part, I've never really done any raids really or any of the dungeons except maybe a few times with an old clan i was apart of during And it's my fault because I'm shy and terrified of talking on mic or scared I'll mess something up / I am trying my best to get over this anxiety but it's hard, but I do wanna experience the raids! I've only ever done Spire Of Stars, Scourge of the Past, and Last Wish maybe a few times. With all that being said.It's kinda nice to be back and experience this game again. Reminding me of when I first picked up D1 back in and how it saved my life during a bad break up.i can still remember how I felt playing it during my first Dawning and how much it calmed me down. Anyway, sorry for rambling. Happy to be back and looking forward to Final Shape!",reddit

terminal,"Hello! I am Matthew and as the title says I'm a disabled stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer patient with a barely functioning AC. Back in near October, me and my sister bought our 1st house! We had a inspector go thru and said all was good and our realtor sold us on a home warranty and we specifically asked if it would cover the AC if there ever was a problem and of course she said ""yes' Now, fast forward to February of , i got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer and had to go thru chemo for 6 months so i ended up becoming disabled and unable tl ever return to work due to the amount of damage my body took. During that time, summer came, and we noticed the AC wasn't cooling the house down at all. So we called the home warranty and they sent out a tech from a company who defrosted our coils in the furnace room. Well, that didn't help at all. So we had called again and they sent out another tech who said ""the compressor is not holding pressure"" and told us it needs to be completely replaced, especially since it was under the old refrigerant that's been phased out *house was built in 82* Well, time passes and I'm just misrable in my house with it being over 80°F and still doing chemo, so i reached out to our home warranty and they told me ""we are not going tl replace it because of abnormal circumstances"" which at this point i was too weak to pursue any further and so all i could so was just cancel my warranty. So here we are 2 years later and still having the same issue. I don't have good credit at all due to everything thats happened to me, and with summer starting here in NW Indiana, i honestly don't know what to do and overall just feel defeated and helpless. We did get 2 portable units since we have sliding windows, and those just barely helped at all. I am on SS Disability but i mean most of it is eaten up by my mortgage which i am sure many of you can understand. So if anyone has any help or advice on what we can do, I'm all ears and i do appreciate anyone who is reading this and is trying to help. I just want me and my sister to be comfortable especially since she's done alot to help take care of me. If it helps, my unit is a Lennox elite series",reddit

I am scared because I do not want to put the responsibility onto my sister or my parents to have to help me even more than what they've been doing. It wouldn't be fair to make them have to do even more just to keep me alive and well when they have to suffer. I am scared because.I'm just flipping scared. I'm 33.

Laughter is a great medicine and infact my therapist told me of a man in the 40s who laughed himself into remission! So let's all laugh during these difficult and strange times! Grab some coffee n doughnuts! STORY EPISODE ONE THE FRITO MENACE So, during the start of my chemo treatment, my sister was, and still does, helping take care of me since we lived together. She had the idea to.well, gimmie some mary jane 😅 and me being the lame and boring person i am have never really have smoked before save a few times. So, i take too big of a hit when i had gotten home from a chemo session. I'd like to note that my treatment was the one where i did 6 hrs in the infusion bay and then would go home with the portable pump for another and then come back the 3rd day for removal and a white blood cell booster, Anywhos. I get home, i end up taking way too big of a hit and cough my guts out. I calm down after awhile and my sister helps carry me to bed. I rest for a bit and then i walk out to the living room on cloud 9 asking ""SISTER WHERE ARE THE FRIIIITOOOOOOOOOOOOOS"" to which she responds ""i think we're out sorry dude"" and me being out of mind get ultra sad and at the top of my lungs bellow out ""nooooooooooooo my fritoooooooooooooooos. I love my fritooooooooooooooooooos"" My sister is dying laughing and I'm sad we're put of fritos cause i love fritos, especially when we make walking tacos 🤣 and for pretty much the rest of the night, I'm just talking about how much i miss my fritos 😅 Once i finally came down and was fully aware, my sister told me all about my obsession and how sad i was about fritos to which i goto the store and a big box of 50 little bags of fritos.

terminal,"Today, exactly 2 years ago at my final treatment of chemo, my oncologist announced to me that I was in complete remission. Stage 4 Pancreatic And Liver cancer. 2 years. 2 whole flipping years. I'm being maintained with chemo pills that I will have to take for the rest of my life however that may be since.well.my oncologist has never given me a expiration date. In her words ""you could walk outside get hit by a car and die. Idk if and when you will pass, but you need to live your life to your fullest"" And even tho I have my paranoia. I'm grateful to know I could live a long and somewhat comfortable life. I am 33 now and all this happened right before I turned 31 in . I'll never forget that pain that made me finally goto the ER. My oncologist did clarify me as fully disabled and could no longer work due to the face I'll be stage 4 for the rest of my life and that there is always the possibility of it returning, but until then.I am ordered to live. My mom has been encouraging me to maybe contact the Cancer Society and be a motivational speaker so that I can hopefully help others who are scared and alone, because not everyone gets to have a support team and that is truly unacceptable. I'm just.scared of being told ""No"" But anyway, in the great words of Joshua Graham ""the fire inside me burned Brighter than the fire around me and it was their love"" ""In the end, there is always light in the darkness"" If you ever came across a Joshua Graham quote video and saw the YouTuber name "" drhomer38"" das me!

I'll go first! *just incase it doesn't show cause I'm still an n00b with reddit, stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer patient * I got diagnosed in at the age of 30, and during my 6 months of chemo, I had a wisdom tooth that needed to come out really bad. I made my appointment with my dentist at the time, filled him and his staff in that yes I was in the middle of going thru chemo, and that this day was on my off week from it. My dentist at the time was very hesitant, asking me if I was sure I wanted to go thru with them pulling the tooth out while I was going thru such a intense procedure and with what was being pumped into me. I replied ""yes, i am sure. I'm on pain medication and I'll be fine, but please get this out"" He understands and agrees, I sign the paperwork and then get my numbing agent and like 2 or 3 shots of novacaine into my mouth. He gets the tooth pulling thingy or whatever expensive word it's called, and after about 5 mins of doing his thing, it was out! Sweet molasses with a side of asses.relief. Him and a few of his staff stood around me ya know checking to make sure it was all out and I will never forget him telling me ""You are seriously one of the strongest and toughest patients I've ever had. To he going thru chemo and braving having a tooth pulled.jesus"" I felt so confident after that. My other favorite moment has been when I posted my story to a Mass Effect fan group on Facebook, and the flood of comments of people calling me ""Bad Ass"" ""tough"" ""brave"" ""strong"" And then having people message me or comment that I was an inspiration for them.I cried. I cried so hard because I never knew people would look up to me 🥹 I felt like a Hero. All my life I wanted to help people.

terminal,"Hello! I have been a huge fan S.T.A.L.K.E.R since I found out about the series a few years ago from YouTube channels such as Warlockracy, GmanLives, and Salt Factory and of course thanks to the mini series Chernobyl and I actually did work in a nuclear pharmacy as a courier and dispatcher, disposal, and quality control! To say games like this and fallout facinate me is well, an understatement lol. Anyway, I started playing SOC bout a year or 2 ago on PC and.well I gave up and got frustrated. I did keep giving it more tries but I unfortunately suck at the games unless I turned the difficulty down or watched more gameplay videos. Then when the Legends Of The Zone released, I immediately got it for my XSX and it was much more of an enjoyable experience even though I haven't finished it or anything but the game is so much fun! And not to mention the lore! I absolutely love the ingame universe! Then S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 comes out and I again get it in XSX and.well I tried playing on Veteran and well i wasnt having fun.I ended up having to turn the difficulty down to Recruit because I was constantly struggling and dying even with all the patches we have now and I kept blowing thru ammo and medkits. I do unfortunately have the bad habit of wanting to just go in guns blazing which I understand is usually a bad idea. But Anyway, I've been enjoying the game way more on the Recruit difficulty and even have been getting thru the story which I absolutely love it! But.am I really enjoying it or am I just a poser since I'm only playing on easy? I know it sounds silly, but I am still kinda new to all this. Lastly, I wanna share something very important to me about the series. You see, I'm.a cancer patient. Terminal to be specific. Stage 4 pancreatic and liver. Diagnosed in February of . And Firelakes, Dirge For The Planet, played when I was first admitted to the hospital and was the song that I cried almost every tear out of my body because of the pain I was in. BTW it was the cover done by Alina Gingertail which her voice just *chefs kiss* but yeah that song holds a special place as a reminder of the pain and hell I went thru with being diagnosed, going thru 12 rounds of hell with chemo, and eventually making it into remission! But unfortunately not cured because well, it's impossible and I'll be stage 4 til the day I do go. Well, that's it.

terminal,"Greetings, Hello, Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Hey! Matt here! Stage 4 Pancreatic and Liver patient here wanting to well.well I just wanna vent about things that I have been bothering me for a bit and well.yeah, here we go. I'm sorry if it's a long read. I've been in alot of pain the last few years and it's only gotten worse. My lower back has been hurting for an extremely long time. Oncologist sent me to a pain Dr and had an MRI done in March of , and it was discovered that I have arthritis in my spine and what appears to be a left over *DEAD* tumor fat tissue or whatever that's pushing on my nerves in my lower back. I can barely walk around my own house and even with my daily pain medication ""Percocet"" and muscle relaxers ""flexerill"" it's a chore and.unfortunately I've gained alot of weight. I'm almost pounds and it's my fault. I clung to food because it helped me feel good while grieving and just dealing with anxiety. I remember back when I had started chemo in , my mom told me ""look, I understand you gotta eat and that's ok! But I don't want you to gain all that weight back and be depressed Matt I don't wanna see you upset again"" and well.I didn't listen.and I wish I did. Mom was right. This coming Wednesday i will be seeing a weight loss doctor who came referred from my Oncologist. I am scared.because I am scared I will have to do things I'm uncomfortable doing or having to continue giving up things I love eating and I know it sounds dumb but.its the truth about me ( 😞 I do need to add that I am a type 1 diabetic due to the cancer and have already been told that I cannot use Ozempic or anything of the sort but.since there is no active cancer.they might wanna try it. Just to see. I'm just so miserable from feeling so weak. I feel like I'm just a burden to my family and that it's just my fault because I couldn't stop eating. And that's.another thing.I've been afraid of those around me. I'm scared of the day I lose my parents or sisters.my mom is a cancer survivor, breast cancer and chronic leukemia she's 70 now and still doing so much. My dad is a type 2 diabetic and also has kidney issues along with.well his Alzheimers but so far he's still doing great and he is also 70. My sister, the one who lives with me and has taken care of me, she's 38 with no cancer.but was found to carry the same BRCA gene mutation as me, my mom, and the rest of my moms side of the family so she has to have surgery as preventative measures which I'm glad my sister won't have to go thru chemo like I did.but I'm still scared that like with what happened to me it'll just.happen. I'm just scared of losing them because everything just feels like it's moving so fast and I'm scared of living in a world without them. I know I have to one day, but dear god it's everyday for the last 3 years I've just been stuck thinking about it. I know when I opened up to my mom about it, she told me that ""when you are faced with your own mortality that you worry about those around you"" I even told her I know im not strong or smart enough to live without her to which she laughed and said ""yes you are because me and your father raised you to be"" I'm sorry for this being so long. I just have so much to say and I felt coming here and just screaming into the void would help. It's been almost 3 years since my life changed. February 25th was when I got admitted to the hospital for 5 days from chest pain and blood sugar stuck in the s, then March 7th I was officially diagnosed with stage IV Pancreatic and Liver Cancer and did 12 rounds of hell with chemo thru the chemo cocktails. September will mark 3 years since making it into remission but unfortunately I'll be stage 4 for the rest of my life since well, it's stage 4. I've done my best to help people who are scared, confused, alone, or are just needing a friend. But even I get overwhelmed with how scared I am with everything and.I'm sorry.I'm rambling.

terminal,"Good morning. My name is Cherri. I was Robbie's volunteer doula with the hospice program. I am posting here to honor his wishes in providing this message board with an update after his passing. I am not familiar with this app, but Robbie gave me a little tutorial. Please forgive any mistakes ) Robbie had initially wanted to pass while conscious, however, he was having increased difficulty breathing Sunday morning. He received last rites from our chaplain and was sedated with midazolam, at his request, at 3:05 pm. He remained asleep and appeared comfortable. Agonal respirations were noted by the nurse at 6:14 pm and suppressed with morphine. The physician called time of death at 6:27 pm, Sunday, November 15, . Robbie's passing was peaceful and without pain. Robbie spoke often of the kind messages he received on this board. I know they brought him comfort. His final posting was incredibly poignant and moved even our most seasoned staff to tears. He was a quiet man. I think his voice was his words. It was honor to attend to him in his passing. I was attracted to hospice because not everybody breaks a bone, not everybody has heart disease, but everybody dies. It is an honor to be with others as the undergo this universal journey, and it was a particular honor to attend to Robbie, who had no family or friends by his side. I am providing some images on imager that Robbie wanted shared with this board, one of him young and healthy, the other a final handwritten note. Please let me know if the link works: I obviously cannot hold onto his phone ) it will be shut off and filed away with his estate, which is being handled by his family, who our social workers were able to locate Sunday evening. They expressed regret at the news of his illness and passing. We are sharing his final posting with them as well. One last thing before I go. First, Robby expressed many concerns about his suboxone. As the opiate epidemic continues to ravage our communities, we see more and more patients entering hospice on suboxone and methadone. I want those of you with opioid maintenance to know that you will never be judged by our staff, and your medications are not a barrier for care. Our organization consults with a pain specialist physician specifically for these cases. We will never let you die in pain. Never! I hope this posting provides some closure for those of you who have been following Robbie's case. These fast cancers are always sad, but Robbie faced his passing with dignity and grace. He was truly a wonderful man, and he lives on in our memories. With regards, Cherri N",reddit

Any reason why do you think? He says its because he doesn't want to hurt my hearing.really? I don't have faith in my country's medical services, they always screw me up. Eg just now, the nurse comes in saying she's here to give me Keytruda and then chemotherapy. I said but the doctor just told me only Keytruda.

I've had a sort of doldrum hangover this month with not getting back into the swing of my decluttering but sort of treading water and things not getting obviously worse Well today something bit me on the butt (not literally) and I spent three and a bit hours in my office/craft space. I cleared out emails, paid bills, tidied up all the stuff I'd not quite put away, collected a box of donations for a friend who works with youth, a box for the op shop, a box for a craft group that meets in town, and listed some school uniform on the buy and sell page. I vacuumed, I wiped everything down and I cleared surfaces. I have loaded the donations to my car for delivery tomorrow and made a list of tomorrow's work in there. I even sat in my chair and worked on a craft project! First time in weeks! Even if you aren't making huge strides forward, as long as you don't sink back to the depths of drowning it's ok. I've been beating myself up about a lack of progress but it's pointless to do that. Put the energy into 5 minutes decluttering",reddit
terminal,What is the best part of being in a decluttered space for you? For me it was walking into a room carrying a delivery box and being able to walk without worrying about knocking something over or kicking something. Also I have noticed that I sleep better now I have cleared the cr from my sightlines in bed. What is it for you? Genuinely curious,reddit
terminal,"So I'm ready to cast on but I'm not sure how to figure out what size to cast on. The sizes are given for finished width, not on body measurements. I'm a somewhat solidly lumpy person so do I go huge or more medium? I've searched and not found answers online.",reddit
terminal,"I've been feeling like I've slowed right down and making less obvious progress, but still maintaining what I've done. So not zipping ahead but taking small steps forward while maintaining. We had visitors to the house yesterday who haven't been here since before Xmas. One of the first things that they said was wow your living area looks amazing! Did you paint? Nope. Just decluttered and kept on with it. Apparently the room looks lighter, brighter, bigger and comfy. Yay me So even if you think you are not getting far, you definitely are way further along than when you started. Sustainable change comes in slow steps.",reddit
terminal,"Seven years ago I was told I had cancer and my prognosis wasn't good. My official diagnosis was explained properly to me on the 7th and the 9th is when I broke my children's childhoods and had to explain to them what was going on. That was the worst day of my life. This year I feel numb about the whole thing. I was initially told life expectancy of 5 years so I've had longer. The side effects of my treatment are absolutely kicking my arse right now and I need to decide if taking a break is worth the risk. I can't die right now but quite honestly I'm so tired that I wouldn't mind a coma because at least I would get a proper rest. Then I feel guilty for thinking of myself when it's my children who are most important in this whole mess. They were 7, 8 and 11 when I had to tell them and my first oncology appointment was on my eldest 's 12th birthday. So yeah happy 7 years to me",reddit

I am sick of lying in the bath because I need the relief. It's just been my Cancer-versary which also stirs up all kinds of stuff. Then today I went to an appt and had to explain it all and I almost cried - not from the situation but from the sheer exhaustion of explaining the same shit all the time.

A few times they have text my child to come and rescue them (doesn't have a car, lives in an estate that is pretty cut off once the last bus has gone for the day) Last week was a really bad outburst, my child brought them to our place. I fed them, took photos of their injuries in case it's needed later, gave them a shower and bed for the night, and washed and dried their clothes. This morning the father came up to me at the shops and told me if I kidnapped his child again he would press charges. I acted dumb because I was quite intimidated and said you have the wrong person. So this kid is 19. Can't afford to move out, but can't tolerate much more. What are the legalities here? How much can my child and me do?

I have a recurrent side effect that is currently playing hell with me - I'm waiting for the appointment with the relevant other specialist to check if it's just the usual or something new. Meanwhile I'm constantly sore (more so than usual) very tired and run down, and struggling a bit. And then my youngest child has been diagnosed with a chronic illness which requires a lot of appointments and help right now, it's a difficult age to be diagnosed and things are difficult for them right now. And I have to be strong for them, not lose my patience with my other children when they say I'm favouring the youngest (kids are 19, 15 and 14, definitely old enough to get illness and hospital appointments trump wanting me to drive them to the shopping centre) And manage myself plus the house and everything else. Their father is absent by his choice. I have people who say they will help but honestly what I need is someone to think for a day. Things are just hard. Today I took a big painkiller at 1pm and went to bed and sobbed. The dog is a great help but she is 5.5kgs and has no thumbs so limited.

I'm so proud that they decided what was going. The nest builder said well mum I looked in your room and it's so much bigger than mine, then I started thinking maybe my room would be bigger if I just had, like you know, not as much stuff.

terminal,"Here's some background from my post about this before: Basically, because of my treatment, my nose and mouth tend to bleed a lot if I engage in strenuous activity, i.e. sex or anything that raises my heart rate or makes me strain. Aside from that, my sex drive was at 0 due to the medicines. My husband has been very supportive and hasn't demanded anything of me but I felt bad about the situation and hated that he couldn't get any intimacy. So I got a ton of suggestions from people here on the sub and some of them really worked! I just wanted to make an update for the good folks here who made great tips. We tried a lot of things that didn't work for many different reasons. For example, anything related to touching me, such as cuddling or kissing would instantly result in a nosebleed. Basically, anything that would make me horny is a no-no. This was the most significant challenge because his pleasure was based around mine. But apparently, massages (particularly on his buttocks) really worked. I get no pleasure from using my hands and he hated handjobs, but we found out that he really liked being touched all over his body instead and the oil turned him on as well. Afterwards, I would use a silicone tool for him (someone suggested this and it's so cool) to simulate sex. All the while, I didn't need to get naked or anything and my heart rate stayed stable. We've been experimenting on blindfolds as well. Lastly, I found some oral lubrication sprays that someone told me about through DM (thank you for that most of all) that helped prevent bleeding a lot. It allowed me to do oral more comfortably though I'm still terrible at it (lol. Anyway, things have improved a lot, thanks to you fine folks. You basically saved my dead bedroom! Even if it's just for him, it's enough, and our bond is even stronger now. Thank you!",reddit

terminal,"I'm (40f) the breadwinner of the family and my husband voluntarily closed down his business in order to take better care of our daughter and myself. I was diagnosed with cancer almost 4 years ago. I'm fine now (story in my profile) and living a very active lifestyle. I run a successful business and we don't have any financial difficulties whatsoever. Even with my diagnosis, I didn't want to stop working as honestly, it gives me purpose and keeps me positive. To facilate this, my husband took it upon himself to end his career so that he could always cook healthy meals for me, be my physical trainer, be my on-call nurse (he trained himself, do all the house chores and errands, and basically always be available at all times whenever I needed to go to the hospital or some other emergency. This has enabled me to continue my work without worrying about anything. Sometimes, though, he has a tendency to panic about our family's finances. I get it coz he isn't involved in it at all anymore so of course there will be some trepidation. I do my best to reassure him that things are fine and we can afford to go on vacations or buy gadgets and whatnot. However, every time I buy something remotely expensive or I make some investment in anything, he literally flies off the wall. It feels like he doesn't trust me. I'm not saying I'm some financial wizard or anything but in the intervening years after my diagnosis, I've basically doubled our net worth despite him not working anymore. Yet just last night, he was questioning me again and panicking about our financial situation. I showed him our bank statements but he still feels that we need to save more, stop spending, cancel our vacation, etc. I get really annoyed and upset whenever he does this. Last night, I got pissed when he kept on about it. I felt like all my hard work was being marginalized. I'm not sure what to say or do anymore to get him to simply stop worrying. Am I overreacting?",reddit

terminal,"Kind of a unique issue here, I hope you'll bear with me. I've posted before on different subs about my condition. Basically, I have cancer (I'm fine, don't worry) and the treatment prevents my husband and I from having sex. People advised me to seek alternative ways to have intimacy to please him and they've largely worked (massage oil, toys, etc. Thing is, even before my diagnosis, I've always had trouble with his size. However, I was able to figure out various means to deal with it at the time when we were still having sex through changing positions, using lube, etc. But it's different now since we can't have sex. While he's okay with the stuff I mentioned before, he's asking for oral a lot more often now (coz of my limitations. I've always been uncomfortable with it partially because I'm not that experienced but mostly because he's just big. I've told him various times about this but he asks for it every time anyway, almost begging at times. I understand, of course, coz he's had to suppress his desire in consideration of my condition. He has never complained about it. When I try to give him oral, I frequently gag and it feels really uncomfortable. Fortunately, when this happens, he stops me and apologizes, and we just try to do some other thing. Still, the next time we do something, he asks for it again, and the cycle continues. How do I communicate to him that I don't want to do oral anymore, or is there some way for me to make this more comfortable?",reddit

terminal,"Things normally go really well between us but tonight, we really exploded. It all started when I forgot my keys and asked him to come open the door. I know, it's petty. He told me to come to the lobby so he can hand me the keys, as he was in the car with our sleeping daughter and couldn't just leave her there. But my feet hurt and I didn't want to go downstairs again so I kinda got really irritated and snapped. He then started to semi-mock me by repeatedly telling me that I could walk 30 steps just to get the keys, and I knew I was behaving like a primadonna but I didn't care and yelled at him anyway. I ended up getting the keys anyway. Ugh. He's right and I know it. But I was so pissed and the argument dragged on into the night and all sorts of things got hashed out in the open. Apparently, he's been really upset that I have no consideration for him and I take his feelings for granted. I didn't really realize this and I thought I'd been giving him plenty of consideration. I admit I have not been spending as much time with him as I used to, and I tend to be very blunt about things. Also, as I have cancer, our intimacy has been severely limited. He's been very understanding about it but he tonight, his bottle was full and the frustration boiled over. It was an awful fight. He was crying and I was crying and he ripped his shirt off and we said a lot of stuff we didn't mean. Ugh. I hated it so much.",reddit
terminal,"For context, my first post from 3 days ago: Basically, I have cancer (I'm fine) so we can't have sex due to my treatment. He'd been asking for more oral as a result, and I'm happy to do everything I can to please him, but oral is uncomfortable because he's quite large. In between that and just now, we had a huge fight (which was my fault) but it ended up okay. I did have to make it up to him. I followed a lot of the advice some of the kind folks here gave me. Before, I would gag and struggle to even get past the head, and you all made me realize I was simply doing it wrong. I thought that it was necessary to actually suck the thing. Instead, I focused on licking and kissing and using my hands a lot more. Someone suggested coconut oil as a lubricant and it worked wonders! I didn't mind the taste, so I could lick freely without gagging, and focused on tickling and rubbing him with my hands. Many told me to keep eye contact and talk dirty but those are still too awkward for me, I'll have to work on it. Someone also suggested focusing licking his testicles then using my hands at the same time and I think that became his favorite part of the whole thing. Anyway, it was a great experience for both of us. He told me it was better than actual sex! And I felt so empowered that, despite my condition, I could really please his desires this time without any discomfort. I know it's not my fault in the first place but I've always had a compulsion to try and do what I can to make the best of the situation. Our previous attempts were okay but they did feel sort of half-assed from my point of view (he never complained but I could feel it. This is really important to me because my treatment is basically for the rest of my life. So finding this long term solution, I think, will improve our relationship over time. I've already ordered some of the sleeves and toys others suggested and I'm sure they'll spice things up even more for him. I just want to thank everyone for their suggestions and not laughing at my ineptitude. I was sort of afraid to post about it coz I'm inexperienced and my question sounded stupid in my head. Thank you again. Edit: if you have other suggestions or whatever, just dm. I appreciate every tidbit of information.",reddit
terminal,"For context on my last update yesterday: Basically, a lot of kind people here offered lots of suggestions on how I could solve our intimacy issue (I have cancer and we can't have sex, husband is too big for oral, full story in my profile) and I implemented a bunch of them and they worked out great. Many of the other tips I received centered around using tools and toys and today, they arrived. I can't discuss them in detail but basically I got a sleeve, a vibrating ring, and a silicone vagina. Thank you to the commenters who suggested them. But the only thing that ended up helping was the vibrating ring. Someone sent me a dm about it and explained how it's used, so thank you, coz it really worked! At first, it was uncomfortable to put on but thankfully it was stretchable. It made him even bigger (I didn't think it was possible) and harder than usual and I suppose it salvaged the evening for us. The other 2 were too small for him to fit, and they were already the largest sizes I could find (admittedly, I'm in a rather conservative area, sex shops aren't so common around here, and international shipping is abysmal. When we did marginally succeed with the sleeve, it irritated him and he described the feeling as like being sucked on by a clammy fish. We laughed so hard at that. Maybe we just didn't use it right. About dirty talk and eye contact. . I'm still terrible. Whenever I say anything, I still sound like an AI. I have a foreign accent so when I speak, it doesn't sound natural. Complimenting him about his size made me cringe. My moans also sounded like sheep coz I'm not actually turned on. I'm not allowed to be coz I would bleed like crazy, which is why we can't have sex in the first place. This led to eye contact being a problem coz looking at his face filled with pleasure makes it impossible for me to not be turned on, which led my nose to bleed immediately. Still, it turned out well, probably better than yesterday coz we were laughing so much while using the toys. After my bleeding stopped, we just went with what we did yesterday, this time while wearing the vibrating ring, (focusing licking on his testicles while using my hands) and added someone's suggestion to lick his perineum (which drove him crazy. There's clearly a lot of room for improvement though. Overall, he's having a blast and I'm comfortable doing it. No more gagging for me! I'm really happy about the improvements we've made. I honestly feel like I'm connecting with this community coz somehow, you understand my issues, forgiving my ineptitude, and I appreciate that a lot. It might seem like a small issue (woman can't handle her husband's size) but with my circumstances, it means a lot that I've been able to solve it. I love my husband and I don't want him to feel deprived of anything. If anyone has other suggestions, feel free to let me know. )",reddit
terminal,"Note: This story is about what occurred months ago. *We are fine now* We are currently back to having regular sexual sessions (more info in my profile. I’m posting this first so you would have background on how we got to where we are now. Other parts, which will be posted later on, will clarify. In short, I'm a cancer patient, and sex makes me bleed due to the treatment. As a result, we had to stop having sex. *HOWEVER, I’m completely fine now* and I’m currently beating the disease, *so don’t offer sympathy* lol *just enjoy the story. I've decided to write about my experiences just to document it and for a lil fun. I bleed when I get intensely horny. . but sex stories seem to be mild enough for some personal fun without the blood. First attempt, forgive me. % true, 2% embellished. *Again, I'm fine. Please enjoy the story and don't worry about me* - I came hard; so intensely that I lay in a pool of my own blood unable to process what was happening. Panic stricken, he rushed to me, grabbing me, wiping my overflowing nostrils trying to stem the flow. I was putty in his hands for a brief moment, still in an orgasmic trance, until I realized I had blown a gasket. Again. Every time. Every fucking time, I can't even enjoy his tongue on my pussy without creating a crimson mask. Are my orgasms simply too much for my fragile nerves to handle? Truth be told, I knew before we started. I knew I would bleed again. I knew it would get worse as he finger fucked me. I knew I was bleeding minutes into him lathering my clit with saliva. I knew that tiny vessels in my mouth and nose had splintered the moment he slid my panties off. I even knew what would happen before my hand met his huge cock during dinner. I even knew it days before; weeks before. I can't have sex anymore. I can't cum anymore. That's just how fucked up life is. Cancer is a real bitch. It's bad enough that it's trying to kill me; what's worse is that in the process of me kicking its ass (like I said, I'm totally fine, coz I'm kicking cancer to the curb, it's making basic functions more challenging. It's hard to eat. It's difficult to sleep. It's a chore to even get out of bed. But I'm fighting it and I'm winning. I don't want any sympathy. I just want to live normally. However, cancer had one more insult, one more ""fuck you"" to send to me before I could bury it for good. It took my husband's big dick away from me. That same dick that I fantasize about every day when I touch myself when he's not home. The same dick that had once made me cum four times in a row due to its veins pounding my walls as it throbbed relentlessly. The treatment causes my blood's platelets to bottom out, causing me to bleed easily whenever I strain myself or if my heart rate soars - like when he fucks me. So I denied it. I didn't care what would happen to me. I would never allow myself to be starved of the services of his cock. After treatment, that night, I hatched a plan that would defy the odds and I would continue to be railed and he wouldn't be able to stop himself from stuffing me silly. I had to be devious; he's so careful these days and would outright refuse to fuck me out of fear. Right before this, I had attempted to lick his ear to goad him into sex. He grabbed me and whispered in my ear, ""it's okay baby. . we don't have to"" Fuck that shit. We have to. You have to fuck me. So I uncharacteristically dressed like a slut and behaved like one all evening. I would not be denied. As he cooked, I ran my nails over his ass. His anus was his weakness and I exploited it. You like that huh? Pervert. Mind you, I'm normally an innocent, conservative, pure, petite lady. If you saw me in public, you'd think I'm a librarian or a congresswoman. In contrast, my husband used to be a basketball player so I barely reach his nipples. Therefore, perhaps my sudden overt interest in his butt had given him a few convulsions. He certainly had gotten himself worked up quite quickly as his dick had become clearly outlined on his pants within seconds of my scratches. His size had always fascinated me, being such a small girl, in both negative and positive ways. It's bad that his penis is almost as big as my forearm - making it so difficult to suck, which presents a secondary problem - the image of me struggling with his big head makes him want me to blow him even more despite my discomfort. He thinks it's sexy to see me gag on his dick and he loves the feeling of my tiny mouth around his girth. It's also bad that I need special positions just to fit him inside me. It's bad that when he's inside me, I can't feel my hands. Or my feet. Or my brain. It's good. It's just good. I apologize. I never meant any insult Mr. John (what I call his dick. May I please you with my pussy today? To make up for being a bad girl? To make up for saying your dick was too big for my tiny hole? No, those weren't random ramblings. I had whispered those dirty words an inch from his ear during dinner. You might imagine that he slapped me as he had never heard such words from my innocent mouth before. He did slap me. Then kissed me. His tongue flooded me. I felt it squirming not just in my mouth, but also down into my esophagus, desperately reaching into my core. It was not a tongue but a reflection of the big cock I was going to shove into my throat later on and he was merely lubricating the way. I was also spreading my own lubrication. I had quietly freed his hard rod and smeared his precum all over the shaft. I have always loved standing and kissing with reckless abandon with something hard yet soft resting on my palm. All the while, I kept telling the lesions and tumors in my body, ""take that, bitch-ass cancer"" But I've always thought my husband was quite strange in that he wouldn't just take my obvious desire and transform it into his own orgasm immediately. He always required tribute. A sacrifice that I must pay in order for me to qualify as a worshipper of his big cock. He needed me to cum multiple times before he would allow me access. It was a requirement. There was never any negotiation. As much as I would beg him to fuck me, he would just lay me down and suck on my clit before anything would occur. And that climax would always come. Alwyayssdsas. . Always. His tongue is a magnificent creature that feeds on my pussy juice and devours all of its contents ravenously and mercilessly. My clit would always respond erect from the first lick and it would take him seconds to find the right spot to make me gush. I would blush as a result, as remember, being a demure lady, I mustn't make squealing sounds and animalistic moans like a common slut. But in each of these offerings of tribute, I become nothing but a servant to the will of his licks. The same ritual was about to occur that fine evening. He removed my hand and proceeded to brutally caress my panties away. He stared at me and mouthed the words, ""cum for me, before his lips touched my knees. *A drop of blood trickled down my left nostril. I wiped it away* His tongue kissed my inner thigh. *My heart signaled a warning. My pussy silenced it* He licked my pubic hair. *I could taste my life in my mouth. I swallowed it all* He ran his wet lips on my clit. *My nostrils were full and I couldn't breathe. I gasped* He inserted his tongue into my vagina before gliding up my cunt. *The floodgates were getting ripped open. Ripppppepds iopen* He began making circles around the head and writing my name in letters I could recognize. *There were no floodgates left to rip. A thousand horses had suddenly materialized in me and rushed out in unison. I was nothing and no one. Fukckckc* I came hard; so intensely that I lay in a pool of my own blood unable to process what was happening. Panic stricken, he rushed to me, grabbing me, wiping my overflowing nostrils trying to stem the flow. I was putty in his hands for a brief moment until I realized I had blown a gasket. Again. For an hour, we tried stopping it in every way we knew how. It wasn't the first time, after all. But this was different. He recognized the fear and love and love and love in my eyes and rushed me to the emergency room where they finally found a way to stop the bleeding. Shit, this guy must really love me, huh? Because months later, we still hadn't had sex again, but he never opened his mouth about it. He never complained. He never found another innocent pussy to torture. He never asked me either. I never asked him either. (To be continued. Thank you for reading. :D) Part 2:",reddit

Please enjoy the story and don't worry about me* - He came hard in my mouth; so intensely that I started choking on his thick cum. What had begun as some tender, playful banter turned into him shoving his dick in my mouth recklessly, barbarically. It felt like I had been reduced to a hole in the wall. I had begun a journey towards making my mouth into his personal cumslut. It wasn’t comfortable. I gagged dozens of times and felt like vomiting. However, one look on his face made it all worth it. It was glorious. Beforehand, he was fearful and worried, lovingly tender and reassuring. “It’s dangerous. . I don’t want to hurt you. . It’s okay, we don’t have to” over and over, as if fucking me would kill me. Fine, it could. But by this point, it had been weeks since we had anything intimate. That trip to the emergency room really changed our perspectives on what we could and could not do. I would have to compromise on my own pleasure - anything that increases my heart rate substantially or makes me strain will cause me to bleed (cancer is a bitch. But nothing, even that, was going to stop me from having his dick. We had talked about it and agreed that we couldn’t have sex anymore. Treatment is basically for life (I’m a stage 4 patient, but again, I’m fine) and as long as I’m taking it, I will bleed. There’s really nothing I can do about it. But I love my husband very sincerely and he’s done everything to keep me strong and healthy. We’ve come so far in this journey together that I would literally do anything for him and vice versa. Therefore, this bleeding problem was just a hiccup, a speed bump that we would have to overcome together. After all, my appetite for his cock was insatiable and I simply would not be denied. That day, I was feeling especially slutty. I knew he had been pent up after weeks of not getting his daily release and I found myself staring at his crotch all day. Slow down, girl. I also knew I couldn’t get too horny or else a faucet would spring up in my nose. I had to keep a very delicate balancing act that would take him to the edge without necessarily dragging me there with him. We manage a real estate business together and he had been pouring his frustrations into work, but I could tell that the stress was getting to him. It was a warm Sunday afternoon and it was just the two of us in his personal office. At that point, a form of tension had forced its way between us and we had become more distant. Fuck this, I said to myself. I decided then that enough was enough. I was wearing a very professional silk blouse and a tight business skirt while he sported his usual gray suit, the one that makes me daydream about getting pounded as a dirty secretary. I stood up, pulled my glasses down, and stared at him. I pulled up my skirt and dropped my panties to the floor. I sashayed around the carpet, telling him I needed his cock with my eyes. He stared back with worry and love and fear and lust. He wanted it. I wanted it. I sat on his thigh and he felt my damp pussy messing up his pants. “Stop, he said. “Keep going, his eyes said. I delicately placed my fingers on his chest and started massaging him. “Wait, he said. “Scratch my nipples, his eyes said. I unbuttoned his shirt and bit them. I licked his areolas in a wide circle, almost like a tiny cat purring lustfully. Meanwhile, I forcibly slipped a finger into his mouth. That kept him quiet. My other hand had unzipped his pants. My pussy tingled as I felt his precum on the tip of his massive cock. I found myself riding his leg and rubbing my clit on the rough polyester. Fuck. I was getting close to the threshold. It’s so fucking huge. Fuck. I played with the sticky substance with my fingers and rubbed it all over. Fuck. I could feel something rising in my throat. My current state threatened to end everything before it could get started. A few drops of blood fell from my nose to his shirt and he immediately sat up and grabbed my hands to stop me. I froze. He froze. He shook his head. “It’s okay, baby, we don’t have to. Again. Those shitty words. But I wrenched myself free from his grip and took a deep breath as I wiped my face clean. Zen meditation has worked quite a bit to control my heart rate. I lifted my pussy off his soaked pant leg and kissed his hands. Gently, I told myself. I went to his ear and whispered, “don’t try to stop me, before sinking my nails into his frenulum. He still tried to stop me but I was firm. I scratched his glans and his balls and kissed him and drowned him with my lust. Slowly, his resistance vanished. Ignoring my pussy’s screams of “fuck him now, I gently massaged the shaft and used my nails to increase the tension. But I also knew that my handjobs didn’t exactly do it for him. I’m writing this now pretending to be some sort of amazing whore but the truth is, I’m quite inexperienced. My husband is actually the only man I’ve ever been with. His cock is the only one I’ve ever touched or sucked. I’m not very good at pleasing him at all. His dick is so big and I’m so unskilled that I struggle to get even just the head in my mouth. I frequently gag and choke whenever I try to suck it. However, this exact struggle is what turns him on the most. He loves seeing my tiny mouth attempt to fit his girth. He’s that kind of perverted masochist. I love it. After another deep breath, I got on my knees and spat on the head. I turned my tongue in a clockwise direction around it, lubricating it, loving it. I stared daggers directly into his blue eyes, loving him, giving him his due, letting him know that I want him and only him and that even though he temporarily (the minute cancer is gone, we’re back to fucking) can’t have my pussy, he can have everything else for as long as it takes. I sucked him like I had never done before. I ignored my gag reflex and shoved past the head for the first time and worked my tongue on the underside of his enormous shaft like my life depended on it. I was hot. My pussy was drenched. I resisted the urge to touch my clit and it was enough to keep me from bleeding. Somehow, the difficulty of working his huge cock was balancing my lust and preventing it from gushing overboard. But it was enough for me to see his pleasure. His love. His lust. His grunts filled the room as my fingers had both his nipples pinned. As I mentioned, I’m not particularly good at this kind of thing. But today, I was extra motivated to have him cum for me. I would not be denied my prize. He grabbed me by the ears and told me he was going to cum. I tightened my grip and scratched his chest. I went as deep as I could on his cock. He attempted to stand up and pull it out at the last moment but I was ready for him. I grabbed his ass and scratched his anus. His legs shook. His salty cum flooded my throat. He came hard in my mouth; so intensely that I started choking on his thick cum. What had begun as some tender, playful banter turned into him shoving his dick in my mouth recklessly, barbarically. It felt like I had been reduced to a hole in the wall. I had begun a journey towards making my mouth into his personal cumslut. It wasn’t comfortable. I gagged dozens of times and felt like vomiting. However, one look on his face made it all worth it. It was glorious. He had never cum in my mouth before though I had always wanted him to try. However, he always hesitated to do so out of fear. Today, I calmed that fear. I coughed and had tears in my eyes. He sat beside me on the floor and we hugged it out. We stayed like that for several minutes before we straightened ourselves up and went back to work. All the tension was gone. My pussy complained but my overall satisfaction at seeing his satisfaction made it all worthwhile. Tomorrow and for the weeks to come, he would fuck my throat and I would greedily take his cum.

Thank you for everyone who read part 1 and 2. *Again, I'm fine. Please enjoy the story and don't worry about me* - He came all over my face; so forcefully that I flinched and hit my head on the desk. Honestly, sucking his dick had become quite a chore. Recently, we've been doing it daily and it’s quite difficult when you’re a tiny girl with cancer and your man’s penis is monstrously large. I’m not complaining, though, don’t get me wrong. I absolutely worship his cock. I wouldn’t have it any differently. I’m just being honest about the arduous process of sucking him off because we can’t have intercourse. Like I said previously, I would do anything to please my man. However, the blowjobs were starting to wear me down and I had to come up with something different to ease the process. He simply doesn’t fit my tiny mouth as well as my tiny everything. So I did what any self-respecting inexperienced woman would do: I asked Reddit (my posts are still up in my profile. My husband would kill me though if he found out I was talking about our sex life (we’re very private people. It was actually a thrill for me to publicize (semi, coz I’m still anonymous around here) my problem and ask various strangers how to deal with my husband’s big cock. I was both nervous and excited about the concept and some of the tips I received made me unconsciously horny for some unknown reason - thankfully not enough to make my nose bleed. I was told by lots of kind redditors that the secret lay with licking, tickling, and positioning. I could please my man without having to actually suck his dick, they said. Some people were very gracious and gave detailed accounts on what I could do with my fingers and tongue, some to the point of them sending unsolicited dick pics, but on the whole, the experience was both enlightening and hot. I was secretly touching my clit lightly through my panties while imagining what I could do to my husband. I was all wet while I typed responses to a guy who showed me how his girl licked his big black cock and how she sucked his balls while playing with the shaft with her fingers. What made it hotter was how clinical he was about it. “Focus your tongue on his perineum, it’s the spot between his testicles and his anus” I imagined my husband’s balls. I never really gave them much attention before. Hm, his dick is bigger than this guy’s, I thought to myself while I masturbated. I nearly rubbed myself to orgasm. But don’t worry, I knew when to stop. I imagined how I would do it and even practiced on my dildo that afternoon. I hadn’t used it in awhile but I thought a few runs with it would help. While doing it, I realized that all this time, I never really used my tongue all that much. Being a very conservative girl, I thought of sex as something very formulaic; I suck, he licks, we fuck. He was obviously the same in that he never really asked for anything different - or he just loved my tight mouth and pussy so much that he didn’t need to. We’ve always been very vanilla so trying these new things now made me extremely horny. I imagined my husband’s scrotum and how I’d stretch it with my lips. I thought about what his face would look like. He’s fucking handsome. He always has the best orgasm faces. My dildo was drenched with saliva when I was done and so was I. This is kind of dangerous. My husband and I are both serious gamers in our free time. After dinner, he was playing Diablo on his desk and I was sitting behind him, pondering when I should initiate his daily milking session. Usually, I just grab his hand and he knew what time it was. I’d lead him to the room and suck his cock greedily until he came in my mouth. But I also thought about how we could spice things up while implementing my new plan so I did what every gamer has ever fantasized about. God, I’m becoming so slutty. I love it. I moved his chair slightly away from the desk. He looked up at me with a quizzical yet expectant look - it was 9pm, which was his scheduled blowjob time - as I slowly knelt down in front of him. I lifted my skirt up just enough to show him I wasn’t wearing panties. I know, I can’t cum, but the visual was still important as he loved seeing my hairless pussy. I didn’t touch him at first. I wanted his expectations to build. I hadn’t done anything at that point but his cock was already standing against his shorts. I followed another set of suggestions from another kind redditor with a big dick: I bit my lips; put my hair up slowly and tied it behind me; licked my fingers; rubbed my nipples through my sports bra; itsy bitsy spidered my way up his crotch; kept eye contact. A huge wet spot formed where the tip of his penis lay. He was motionless. Silent. Unmoving. It was almost as if he was shocked that his innocent little wife was willing to do something he’s probably dreamed of all his life. “Play your game, I told him. He casually pulled his chair forward and got clicking. I was so fucking horny but kept my breathing. Zen saved my life there. I slowly pulled on his shorts and he obliged by lifting his butt up slightly. His cock bounced up as it went free. I hesitated. I’ve sucked him so many times but every time I see it, I still salivate. I put two fingers on the shiny tip and held it up, away from my face. Then with meticulous care, I kissed his left testicle. His scrotum immediately shriveled up. Then I licked the right and put it in my mouth. His balls actually were disproportionately small compared to his huge cock so I didn’t have any trouble sucking them. He gasped. The clicking stopped. I pinched the head and stopped as well, signaling that I wouldn’t continue if he didn’t keep playing. The game went on. I then lifted his ballsack and got to work on my prize. I mentioned before that his anus was his weakness and I was used to scratching and caressing it. It never occurred to me that there was a more sensitive spot right in the middle. I licked him testily right above his asshole. He froze. I licked it again, this time closer to his balls. Meanwhile, I had begun to stroke his shaft with my fingers. His legs shook. I looked up at his face through my thick glasses and found that he had his eyes closed. Seeing him in such pleasure fucked me up bad. I was dripping wet. My nose started too. I quickly mopped my face up and took several deep breaths. His trance immediately broke and he crouched down to help me. I waved him away with a smile and a kiss and pushed him back onto his chair. It was a cathartic moment for me, being so comfortable pleasing him, as previously it had always been difficult. Maybe to you, this was just a small thing. But for a girl like me and my conservative background, it felt like such a victory. I crawled back into position and buried my lips into his scrotum. Being so close to his balls was addictive. I was licking and sucking them alternately like I was possessed while his precum dripped all over my lips. I had wrapped my hand around his dick and had started to pump it vigorously, staring at him, him staring back, his game all but forgotten. “I’m gonna cuummm, he whispered. I then followed another suggestion from another big dicked redditor: I positioned his big head onto my face. He came all over my face; so forcefully that I flinched and hit my head on the desk. Honestly, sucking his dick had become quite a chore. Recently, I’ve been doing it daily and it’s quite difficult when you’re a tiny girl with cancer and your man’s penis is monstrously large. I’m not complaining, though, don’t get me wrong. I absolutely worship his cock. I wouldn’t have it any differently. I’m just being honest about the arduous process of sucking him off because we can’t have intercourse. But this, tonight, not having to struggle yet getting an even better result - I can’t put into words how it felt. Of course I was burning up with no opportunity to cum and that sucked but I felt extremely validated. I was strangely proud of my simple accomplishment. “That was better than sex, he said. “I love you, I said. “I fucking love you, he said. I sucked his wet cock one more time as he gazed at my cum covered face. (To be continued. Thank you for reading. :D) Part 4:",reddit

Please enjoy the story and don't worry about me* - Suddenly, he came on my oily, outstretched hand; so smoothly that at first that I didn’t even realize he was cumming. Feeling his sticky cum made me come back to my senses. We had developed a convenient routine for draining his balls. He basically cums on my command now. Even though it’s now a one-sided affair, his satisfaction has somehow become mine as well. Whenever he cums for me, it almost feels like I’m having an orgasm as well. Since I don’t need to strain myself anymore because of the new techniques I learned with my tongue and hands, the process has become expedient. However, that hasn’t stopped me from wanting to learn more. But that’s only half the story. Beyond learning, I had discovered that I get really horny when strangers teach me about sex but not hot enough to make me bleed. A guy showed me how he rubs his thick cock in an effort to teach me how I should touch my husband. I kept the conversation platonic but secretly, I was touching my pussy through my panties. I’ve been doing this for weeks now. My husband doesn’t know and I feel somewhat guilty. So why not just let him touch me but control it and stop before I bleed? No, it’s impossible. I’ve been trying to explain in previous parts of this story that I’m obsessed with his massive dick. I’m obsessed to the point that whenever I feel even the slightest bit horny, I forget he’s a person and think of him as just a piece of meat made to fuck me. Every time I suck him, I have to take deep breaths and imagine the ocean just to prevent myself from exploding. If I let him touch me, I’ll probably end up in the hospital again. No, it’s enough for me to have these little innocent conversations. They’re learning experiences, I swear, I have no ulterior motives. I’m a slut for my man and only my man. Mmm I suppose there’s this one girl - I’m not lesbian - who taught me about the benefits of using oil. She told me all about tantric massages and showed me several videos on how to please a man’s penis and delay his orgasm. She also showed me how she would put her man’s dick between her big tits and how he would cum all over them. I got dizzy watching her. I rubbed my wet clit imagining me doing the same, but then I remembered I didn’t have the tits to pull it off. I only have one now due to surgery. It’s fine, he doesn’t mind. He loves sucking my one nipple. This girl got me thinking. Maybe I’m bisexual? Or maybe I’m just curious? Who knows. The point is, she made me want to try it on my man. I got a bottle of massage oil and got set to practice with my dildo. The majority of the experience is supposed to be more about teasing and prolonging his pleasure so I set myself to the task. I learned to touch lightly, almost featherlike, and use my nails with the intent to graze, to make it feel like an accident. He always gets hard in public when I “happen to” touch his crotch. I love how he can never hide it because he’s so fucking huge. Massaging my dildo made me so hot that I just had to take off my clothes. I was entranced. I had one hand on the shaft and the other on my pussy. I also discovered that the oil on my fingers made rubbing my clit more comfortable and it enabled me to rub it less - slowing down my orgasmic tendencies. Fuck, I thought. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I tend to cum multiple times really quickly; but that could just be because my husband is so good at licking my cunt. I stopped just before my orgasm built up. I was so fucking happy that I wasn’t bleeding. Before my husband got home that night, I made some small preparations. I placed a towel and a donut shaped pillow for his face on the bed; I lit a couple of scented candles; I put on some spa music; I decorated the room a little with some plants and a tiny fountain; I placed a humidifier around his head area; Finally, I put on a slutty-looking cheongsam (a Chinese traditional outfit) with fish decorations and a high slit that showed my non-existent curves. Fuck it, he likes that I’m petite. When he arrived, I welcomed him like a receptionist would. “Welcome, sir, I said with fluttering eyelashes. He instantly understood and let go. I whisked him by the hands towards my carefully crafted massage parlor and carefully removed his jacket. My hand lingered on his chest. I unbuttoned his shirt. He smelled of manly sweat. I led him to the bathroom. I knelt down and unbuckled his belt. His hard cock pushed against his pants. I pulled them down slowly, taking in the view of his shaft struggling against his boxers. I looked up at him, smiling. He looked down at me, smiling. I gently pushed him towards the shower. With his back turned, I put my hands in his waistband and pulled down his underwear, taking care to “accidentally” scratch his backside and hamstrings. He gasped. I turned on the water and took the showerhead to wash his ass. I ran my fingernails through his asshole - light enough, mind you, to almost not be noticeable. I used my new featherlight touch all over his butt while kissing his back with the same lightness. I was fucking thrilled. I had never done anything so erotic. I had him face me with a professional smile. His hard dick was already leaking and I hadn’t even touched it yet. Good. I poured some body wash on the base of the shaft. More precum gushed out. I stroked it gently with one hand while the other went to his testicles. Soap bubbles were all over my fingers. My beautifully prepared outfit was now soaking wet. So was I. I washed the soap off his cock and turned off the water. He protested and clearly wanted me to keep stroking him. I smiled and toweled him dry before dragging him back to the room. He had his hand on my ass through the slit on my dress. I slapped it away. I had him lay on the bed face down, which was slightly difficult due to his big dick being in the way. I spread his legs and sat in the gap. I lathered my hands with oil and rubbed them together. “Cold hands may make him lose his erection” I remembered the girl telling me. She’s so fucking hot. I wonder how it would be if she were here too? Now warmed, I started my strokes. I ran my hands on his asshole, just like in the shower, but the heat and the oil made him moan and his body twitched hard. He thrashed around on the towel as I ran my fingers on his perineum and the edges of his scrotum. I could see his hard cock peeking on the side. That must be uncomfortable. I had him raise his crotch with a gentle tug while putting a rolled towel underneath to support his weight. I then pulled his penis backwards so that it was now pointing at me. “You like that, sir” I whispered into his ear, then licked it. He could only moan his approval. I poured oil all over the shaft and proceeded to lightly tickle it with the back of one hand while keeping the other playing with his butthole and balls, just like the video showed me. I was a good student. He couldn’t lie still. His legs were crushing me and I loved it. I pinched the base of his scrotum and started pulling on his big cock towards me in steady strokes; the oil made my movements extremely fluid and smooth such that I didn’t have to work hard at all. I was so fucking wet. I was soooo fucking wet. Nonetheless, I knew he didn’t have much time left, but I was enjoying it so much that I lost focus on what I was doing and started rubbing my clit on the towel underneath. I was losing my mind. Suddenly, he came on my oily, outstretched hand; so smoothly that at first that I didn’t even realize he was cumming. Feeling his sticky cum made me come back to my senses. We had developed a convenient routine for draining his balls. He basically cums on my command now. Even though it’s now a one-sided affair, his satisfaction has somehow become mine as well.

Since I don’t need to strain myself anymore because of the new techniques I learned with my tongue and hands, the process has become expedient. However, that hasn’t stopped me from wanting to learn more. I almost came too. Fuck. My trance broke completely and I finally realized that he had been yelling my name over and over and now he was crumpled. I went over and kissed him. Deeply. It was the kind of kiss you give to a lover you haven’t seen in years and the kind that you burn into your soul as proof that you love him. All my desire vanished. I was filled with love.

Over the past few months, we've been doing a lot better, with me at least being able to satisfy him in various ways. Today, on new year's eve, we made another significant step.

terminal,"I'm debating between 2 schools of thought: 1. Palpatine was so powerful that he was directing the space battle manually as he sat on his chair, using the force to control the commanders/ships. This is why the empire was ""winning"" while he was still in control and they started ""losing"" as he got increasingly distracted by the Vader/Luke fight. That would mean that had Vader not killed the emperor, the empire would have won the battle. Or 2. Palpatine wasn't really in control of the battle outside and the empire was just winning at the start due to the surprise advantage. The rebels started winning on their own regardless and the emperor's death had no influence on the battle whatsoever.

terminal,I did a pet scan about a month ago and it shows the cancer has now reached my lungs and liver. Well they don’t know if it’s cancer on the liver but I have multiple masses. My oncologist dropped me as a patient so now I’m stuck looking for a new one. Most of the doctors I’ve spoken with has really pushed for hospice. I don’t know what to do or where to turn to. I’m turning 32 on the 28th of this month and I’m not even excited about it. I’m constantly in pain and my oncologist that dropped me didn’t understand how I could be in so much pain.

But I see a lot of fans/defenders of the royal family on this subreddit, and honestly I'm surprised. Are we not watching the same show?

We’ve been texting each other since March, and it was really good for many months. Recently though, she pretty much quit texting me back, and so even though she wasn’t properly ghosting me, I felt abandoned and unimportant. I explained that it was causing me to struggle to stay happy, and asked her for increased emotional intimacy, but she replied that she was taxing herself too much to text me back every day, and that she didn’t have the interest or energy for increased intimacy (her own mental health reasons. That really hurt, bros. I’m housebound from COVID (and terminal cancer, but that’s not really the issue here, and I struggle with the loneliness and isolation. What’s worse is that we met though mutual best friends — they all went to the same high school, and I met our mutual friends in college — so while I’m not completely without a support system, it’s complicated because I’m afraid I can’t vent my feelings honestly to my best friends. I sat on it for a few days, unable to decide if I wanted to go on a break (her preference) or break up entirely (my preference. I put it to her that I wanted to break up, and she understood. We talked just a little bit more about what went wrong between us, and when she expressed a hope to remain friends, and I said that I would like that after an appropriate healing period — and no promises made. Bros, this was like two hours ago, and I’m already wracked with regret. I’m doubting myself, hard. When she ghosted me, I would wait by the phone and simmer, resenting her and desiring her with equal measure. Now I’m afraid that I actually would have been strong enough to go on a break and that I just threw away my last chance at romance (bc cancer. At the same time, I’m afraid that is we hadn’t broken up, I would have just repeated the same cycle of simmering waiting for her to warm up again. I think I chose right. I think I’m just confusing the pain of separation with the pain of choosing wrongly. I hate that I hurt her with our breakdown of communication months ago, but also that I hurt her by choosing myself. I’m so frustrated, but I don’t think she and I can ever get to where we wanted to be. I feel like we both let each other down.

terminal,"This is something that occurred to me that I wanted to ask, more for curiosity’s sake than need of guidance. As I continue practicing meditation and studying the dharma, I notice that I’m more aware of what’s happening in my mind and am better able to account for what I’m experiencing. This is the case for small “mundane” things as well as more significant glimpses into things like suffering. For example, simmering latent anger from traffic this morning still making me impatient with the dog; or realizing that more dessert won’t satisfy that subtle, barely-perceptible dissatisfaction in my mind. Obviously, with annatta/emptiness, the ‘self’ that is ‘known’ here is false, a fabrication. But that leads me to my question: has your progress on the path enabled you to know or to ignore your ‘self’ more easily? I see basis for both positions in the teachings of the dharma. My impression is that as wisdom and insight increase, one would better understand the processes and functions of mind, which leads to a decrease in suffering (at least in my limited personal experience. My next impression is that the increase in ‘self-awareness would lead to understanding of non-self as these mental patterns and formations become better understood. What do you think? Is knowing yourself of value for practice? Has this been addressed in the texts/scriptures? I’m not asking for guidance so much as just curious what people here think.",reddit
terminal,"I’ve taken to sleeping on the ground recently, partially because my bed hurts my back and joints, but also partially because it’s a recommended practice for the Uposatha days.

My question is this: would the foam pad invalidate the idea of sleeping on the floor for the Uposatha? How would something like a foam pad be evaluated in terms of the Vinaya? I know that I’m not a monk, and therefore, not bound by the Vinaya. But IIRC it provides descriptions of the kinds of beds to be used by renunciates, so I guess it would be a good measuring stick for this particular practice. I believe the rule concerning beds is that it can be no higher than 8 finger-widths off the ground, which I assume is in reference to a woven-style bed on a wooden frame. I’m not necessarily worried about my bed necessarily breaking Vinaya rules/Uposatha observances, just curious about how the Vinaya would interpret my sleeping situation.",reddit
terminal,"Hey all. I’m in a bit of a bind in terms of access to the only drug that would ever help my cancer. Some background: I have an extremely rare and aggressive cancer (possibly one of the most quickly-growing and treatment-resistant solid tumors known to science. I’ve been on a clinical trial for a little over two years which — thanks to the trial — is abput 18 months longer than I was told to expect to live. One side-effect of my drug is that the enzyme which indicates heart muscle damage in healthy people (troponin) appears to be falsely elevated. Or rather, it is elevated without any evidence that there is actual damage to my heart: it looks perfectly healthy on all the echocardiograms, EKGs, x-rays, you name it. Because of this elevated chemical, the drug company is preventing me from taking the drug, and they refuse to give me permission to start again until the troponin level goes down. All fine and good, except that my levels have been elevated for a week now, and we don’t know if it’s going to go down again. My doctor disagrees with the company’s decision on this. She feels that my cancer is a *significantly* greater risk to my health than a little heart damage, and I agree with her . I would rather live for longer with an imperfect heart than die in a few months with an intact heart. It’s about how you set your goals. I’m scared that by the time my levels dip down to ‘normal, my cancer will have started growing again. It’s been stopped in its tracks for most of the time I’ve been on the trial, but when it takes off again, oh boy. (When the tumor was on my jaw, it doubled in size every *week) So it’s a matter of getting the company to understand that my heart is less important here than my cancer, and making them understand that prolonging my life is the goal we should be shooting for. Has anybody had a situation like this? Is there… anything I can do to help my situation? Or do I have to wait for some pencil-pushers across the ocean to decide whether I die next month or next year? Edit: Thanks everyone for your concern and advice! It turns out my doctor was secretly working on Compassionate Use paperwork, but was kind enough not to get my hopes up while it was still in limbo. If all goes according to plan, I’ll be using the drug on a compassionate basis in about a month!",reddit

The school seems legitimate, and the teachers do too. There are no ""overweight middle-aged guys"" handing out blackbelts for a quick buck. Heck, I haven't seen anyone wearing a belt at all! The sifus explained that fitness requirements are part of advancement between sashes, and they practice what they preach. They do the aerobics with us during warm-ups. Even more promising, they come across as experienced in the teaching aspect of kung fu instruction. I mean that they're more than just advanced students - they've been taught how to teach. Even outside of all y'all's advice, these are good signs that the school produces well-trained, authentic instructtors. I'm looking forward to learning under their guidance. I also wanted to share an achievement: I can straight-leg kick up to a 90-degree angle! It's not much, I know, but its a sign that I'm making progress and that training is working. I've historically been very inflexible, so seeing any change at all is heartening. Every time I train, the jumping jacks are easier, my bow stance is steadier, and my bodily control is smoother and quicker. For the first time in my life, I'm loving being active. I'm really enjoying learning kung fu, and looking forward to hanging out here while I do. See y'all around!",reddit
terminal,"Kind of a second progress follow-up post, but I just had a really satisfying training session and wanted to share. I love kung fu. Every day I'm stronger and the movements are easier to do well. I'm starting to actually apply the instructions my sifus have talked about - deeper stances, better balance, more fluid movements. In addition to feeling better and being in all-around better shape, I'm starting to understand what the sifus say about learning and forming better qi patterns too. Today, when I was starting on body formations, I stood up correctly kinda by accident and it almost. *crackled. The balls of my feet connected with the earth and I felt the energy flow, just like they say it does. It was refreshing, and I was able to keep a better balance and flow between the positions. I hope this doesn't verge on ""mall ninja shit, but my practice is starting to pay off, and my enthusiasm seems to double each time I train. I ended my session today with a grin ear to ear. They won't always be euphoric like that, but I'm pumped about the changes learning kung fu has brought to my life and the ways it'll continue to make it better.",reddit
terminal,"I think the purpose of this post is to see how far off-base my thinking is, and to get feedback or see if anyone relates.

The reason for 'secrecy' around Dzogchen makes sense to me and I don't have a problem with that. Potential students should be vetted) I've received pointing out instructions from two fairly well-regarded lamas; one rather traditional and one very much not. I think the pointing out instructions might have worked to some extent, which leads me to my first question: *Can pointing out only ""kind of"" work* I've reached out to both lamas, hoping to start a conversation about this. Both times, I got a rather lukewarm, non-committal answer which didn't help. This has left me exasperated as to where I stand with either of the teachers. On the one hand, putting their instructions into practice hasn't yielded the breathtaking transformative experience that Dzogchen teachers speak of; but on the other hand, what I'm experiencing on the cushion isn't *nothing. This has led me to begin exploring the Chan/Zen schools more closely. I know that ""Are Dzogchen and Zen the same"" is a relatively common question asked here, and it's not necessarily my intent to raise that topic.

I'm curious to see if any can weigh in and see if I'm completely wrong about my conclusions. Meido Moore Roshi's books have been my entry point, and he explains that kensho (the experience of Buddhanature) can be either deep or shallow. He continues to explain that once a student has had a kensho experience, the teacher's task is to provide practices which increase a student's familiarity with it and make it easier to embody the experience off the cushion too. So a relatively ""small"" kensho can be worked into a ""bigger"" kensho. Can it work similarly in Dzogchen?

I really haven't gotten the chance to explain this half-way position I'm stuck in, and that's what frustrates me. Here's where I need feedback to see what I might be misunderstanding. To bring this around to the rest of my questions, I think the reason I'm attracted to Zen is because it seems to have a larger 'window of admittance' to practice. In Dzogchen (as well as Mahamudra, you shop around for teachers, taking pointing out instructions until you meet your root guru, the ""one true"" teacher for your lifetime who cracks you wide open and gives you that *full* kensho experience (I don't know if there's an equivalent Tibetan word for direct experience of Buddhanature, and you study with them for at least the rest of your life. In the Zen approach, it seems to be less utterly dependent on the one teacher: students can have deep or shallow kensho experiences on their own, without having ever met their teacher. (However, Moore Roshi explains that only a qualified teacher can confirm legitimate kensho, and that true progress on the path can only occur under a teacher's guidance) So it seems that in Nyingma Dzogchen, the path *only* begins with a ""big enough"" kensho experience of n = 1, whereas in Zen, the path can begin with a kensho experience of n = <1. It seems that Zen embraces ""smaller"" kenshos and works up to bigger, but that Dzogchen only recognizes a direct Buddhanature experience that is ""big enough"" (breathtaking and transformative, like teachers and masters describe.

terminal,"I was reading Omori Sogen Roshi's *Introduction to Zen Training* and this passage resonated with something I'm wrestling with in my practice now. >In his youth, Baso \ did zazen diligently every day. Seeing this, Priest Nangaku Ejo \ asked Baso, ""What do you expect to accomplish by doing zazen"" > >Baso answered, ""I sit because I wish to become a Buddha"" He had forgotten that zazen itself is Buddhahood and was probably trying to become a Buddha through zazen. To demonstrate his mistake, the priest began to polish a roof tile vigorously while Baso was doing zazen. Baso became puzzled and asked, ""What are you doing"" > ""I'm thinking of turning this into a mirror"" replied Ejo. > ""Will a roof tile become a mirror if you polish it"" asked Baso. Priest Ejo glared at and answered, ""Can you become a Buddha by doing zazen"" > \ Ejo continued his admonition: > ""You students, are you trying to learn zazen or are you trying to learn sitting Buddhahood? If you are learning zazen, Zen is not sitting and lying down. If you are learning sitting Buddhahood, Buddha is not a fixed form. According to the teaching of non-attachment or non-settling down, you should not try to adopt this or reject that. You students, if you try to become a sitting Buddha you kill the Buddha, and if you become attached to sitting you will not reach that principle"" > \ If we interpret this literally it probably means the following: > ""You students! Are you trying to learn zazen or are you trying to become a Buddha? If you are trying to learn zazen, you must not be taken up by the form called 'sitting' because Zen is something beyond sitting and lying down. Again, if you say you are trying to become a Buddha, you cannot become a captive to the one set form called 'sitting' because Buddha is something absolute"" (Omori : ) This passage occurs amid Omori Roshi's discussion about correct motivation for Zen practice, but for me it spoke to the subtle ways dualism can sneak into practice, even when we're trying our darndest to step outside the dualistic framework. Something that becomes clearer each time I sit down to practice *susokukan* is the subtle notion of ""Oh, here I am, sitting. I am meditating. This is me transcending dualism. Here I go"" Even though these ideas don't necessarily appear in my mind as verbal thoughts, the dualistic idea that an individual self is sitting down to accomplish something is difficult to escape. What I find particularly difficult is setting aside the tendency to evaluate how the sitting session is going. The irony is that obsessively fixating on the quality of my sit ""oh, this is going well! I'm doing it"" or ""bah, you're undisciplined and lazy; why else can't you do this one simple thing) is absolutely what's distracting from successfully practicing susokukan.

terminal,"In all honesty, not today, but last weekend. I had the opportunity to visit the local -ish) monastery and meet the Roshi there. He invited me to join them for supper and the evening sits. So for those of you who are not aware (myself included, Zen monasteries have very strict discipline in how you conduct yourself: there's a way to stand up, a way to sit down, a way to walk, and a way to stand. A special way to do everything. Oh, and it should be done in complete silence too. So naturally, everything you do is highly ritualized, which is the ideal environment for practicing meditation-in-movement. and for embarrassing the new guy. Here's the FU. Supper is no different; you set out your row of bowls and wait in silence while the cook dishes out the food in (what I assume is) order of seniority. Portion sizes are determined by a ""say when"" system, but instead of using your voice, you use a flick of your hand to tell them to stop dishing you food. But they won't stop unless you flick your hand correctly. So by the time I figured out what do, I had a heaping bowl of white rice at least the size of a softball, more than I could hold in my hands. Supper is a silent affair, but also a fast one. You eat as quickly as you can, in order to get back to the zendo and sit for a while before dokusan. And nobody leaves until everybody is done. So I was scarfing down my food as quickly as possible, enjoying the pepper tofu stirfry and completely forgot about all the rice. Which meant that once I had finished everything and everyone else was done, I still had this massive bowlful of rice to work through. Dry, plain white rice. And nobody goes back to the zendo until all the food is gone. The brother in charge of discipline won't bend the rules for me, it's all gotta be eaten. ""Just put as much in your mouth as you can"" he says. ""Mind over matter"" So I do. I'm sitting there, surrounded by five other full-time practitioners, in total silence, while I try to shove as much rice in my mouth as I possibly can. There is no sound in the room but the noises of me coughing and swallowing, struggling to eat two meals' worth of cereal grain with no water to wash it down. There is nothing happening but me fighting myself, trying to force my dry, dry mouth to keep chewing bite after bite of plain rice. For what felt like 10 whole minutes, I became one with the embarrassment. I know it took too long because when we got back to the zendo, our butts were on the cusions for maybe two minutes tops before we got up and did walking meditation. I was embarrassed for interrupting their schedules, but at the same time, I was cracking up at myself. You always feel out of place when everybody else knows what's going on, and this was no exception. It was really a non-issue, and definitely not the biggest faux pas that visitors have made, but I felt so sheepish for taking too much rice and making it everybody else's problem. Guess I gotta learn to say ""when"" sooner. Really though, they were all super welcoming and understanding. Everyone's patience while I bumbled around and struggled to match pace for walking mediation (Rinzai goes *fast) and tripped over my legs trying to remember to bow leaving and entering the zendo really meant a lot to me. Hopefully it goes smoother next time, and I hope I gave them something to laugh about!",reddit

terminal,"I just finished the first book and while I really enjoyed it, I'm left feeling like the story petered out in the last hundred pages. Really, I felt that the entire ""Part Three: The Prophet"" was disappointing, and I think it's cause Herbert didn't write the story I was expecting. I'll try to avoid spoilers, but the ending of the first novel makes it almost an entirely political story. Aside from the unique political power of his station as Muad'dib, Paul's alliance with the Fremen - his journey of *becoming* Fremen - is basically irrelevant to how he resolves the conflict of the book. He could have achieved a similar result through any other kind of political arrangement with the Fremen, prophetical powers notwithstanding. I guess it's just puzzling to me that Herbert skipped over what I would consider the most interesting parts: Fremen culture and religious life. Things like the mysteries of the Makers, the wisdom gleaned from the hard balance of life in the desert, what it means to be a part of that environment (ecologically as well as spiritually. It just seems like Herbert teed-up all this fascinating stuff and then skipped it. Literally skipped it: Paul's entrance into Fremen culture is breezed over in a timeskip. Maybe I just got the wrong impression from how the franchise is being marketed. I tend to gravitate towards science fiction/fantasy that has spiritual themes and undertones, and I thought *Dune* was the holy grail. I know the story Herbert tells is far from over and that there are a lot of books, but is there more of what I'm looking for in later books? I can appreciate a certain depth of worldbuilding, but if I'm looking for a story about culture and religion that goes beyond just their significance in politics, will I be rewarded by reading more of the *Dune* universe?",reddit

terminal,"Zen lurker here. I've been playing with introducing chant into my practice and have been wanting to memorize the Heart Sutra, which in turn, has me curious about the contexts where its mantra is used. Most other mantras are associated with a specific deity, (Avalokiteshvara, Guru Rinpoche, Tara, etc) and chanting the mantra establishes a connection between you and the deity. But the Heart Sutra mantra isn't connected to a specific deity AFAIK - unless everybody has been ignoring ( for a long time. So what does the Heart Sutra's mantra do? Why and when do people use it?",reddit
terminal,"Has anyone else had weird phlebitis that seemed to get worse over time? I got my second round of chemo (cisplatin+etoposide) around 10 days ago, all three infusions in my right forearm. Now I have firm, tender bumps in what (I think are) my veins. The GP I saw said phlebitis and told me to treat with baby asprin and warm compresses, but that was a few days ago. Now there are two more bumps in the original vein and one larger one in an adjacent vein. Anyone else had this? I'm not terribly concerned, but it's just weird and I don't know what to do.",reddit

So far I haven't noticed any loss of function with my leg, but when I'm on the mat - particularly towards the end of the practice - I notice the affected leg is a little weaker. I have more shake compared to the other side, and I can't hold a given position quite as long. Does anyone have any experience with neurological issues like weakness improving? Any advice?

terminal,"So as far as I can grasp, entirety of the Path is to punch through to emptiness and see your true nature, then practice deepening and living in that mindstate until you become a buddha. But what exactly is the mechanism by which that eliminates suffering? Is it just that when you're awake to reality (emptiness, you don't identify with the things that made you suffer before?

terminal,"So I'm new to wheelchair life. I have cancer with mets in the spine, and earlier this month one of them paralyzed me from the waist down. A week in the hospital, a very stressful plane flight, and what feels like a hundred diaper changes later, I'm at home adjusting and learning to live using a chair. Despite my despair at the beginning, I'm beginning to live quite well and starting to enjoy my life again. I hope my frustration doesn't offend anybody. I'm still very much adjusting. But that leads me to my reason for posting: there's so much I don't know, and so much I want to learn. Stuff like: how do I position my legs to minimize pressure on my feet during car rides? What do I say to my PCP to get them to prescribe a better chair? What is a better chair and how do I know it? How do I find resources in my community and connect with other chair users? And how do I carry a damn cup of coffee from the counter to the table? There are a million other questions I haven't even thought of yet. I'm a newbie and though I'm starting to feel less overwhelmed, there's still just so much I don't know. I want to maximize my independence and lighten the load on my folks, my primary caregivers.

Should I invest in a lift for getting down to the floor? What about just a good, padded bench? I can probably make my wheelchair itself work well enough, but I liked having a designated space. For that matter, space is another issue. My bedroom is now on the ground floor of the house, and it's partially a shared space (the rest is my dad's office.

terminal,"I seem to remember either *Messiah* or *Children* mentioning that for people with some limited prescient abilities, it sort of pushes them over the edge and awakens this, or helps them to see. But since a geriatric isn’t a real class of drug, it got me wondering what melange does for people without any such ability whatsoever? My mind goes to Stilgar, for example. He seems excessively grounded in the present moment of reality, I doubt that he’s got much for prescient ability. So what would melange do for him? As a sort of related question: why do the ‘classic’ Fremen (that is, of Muad’Dib’s time) put spice in everything? I understand that for Leto II they’re trying to overload him, but what’s the purpose of making coffee with the most valuable substance in the universe, especially since I assume most people are like Stilgar? Is it to keep people slightly entranced all the time? Perhaps I missed something basic in the first book.

terminal,I made a post awhile ago about PSU's now doing one on Pc maintenance. PC gaming consoles htpc all need normal maintenance. Cleaning off the case and clear plastic/tempered glass is one thing that needs done. Dust dirt pet hair and even bugs can get inside a pc/gaming device and cause issues. The CPU fan/heatsink need cleaned same as the GPU and PSU. Once they get clogged up with crap they loose cooling and performance can suffer. Things will burn out or fail long before they should. There are many online videos on how to to this or if you dont feel you can take to someone to have it done. I have see everything from mouse turds to cockroaches inside pc's and consoles. Cleaning your system will keep it running happy much longer than a dust covered blob.,reddit

I feel like everything i have gone thru up to this point finally counted for something. Being sick/tired loosing 2 weeks a month for chemo seems not as bad now. Finally after 10 months and 9 months of every other week of chemo has paid off. For those wondering i was given a 10% chance this could happen.

Wrong This woman pulls in and gives me her order sheet Local free 9 yards it says okies i can do that. She had a small chevy s10 pick up that would hold maybe yards at most but she wanted it all NOW! and she wanted the red brick dyed mulch that was 10 bucks a yard. I said sorry i cannot give you the red brick mulch free that's 10 bucks a yard you get the natural (AKA crappy stuff) she went nuts screaming and yelling she was going to talk to the Manager and she was going to call the President of the authority and so on. This went on for 20 minutes till the Manager showed up and told her no! Then she said i wont make 2 trips so i want it all now. The Manager says do it. I got in our big cat loader that had a 9 yard bucket ran into the pile drove up to her dinky lil pickup and said READY? Her eyes were bugging out and she was speechless. The manager already tired of dealing with people all day on a Saturday said might wanna open the glove box and walked away. She said i will come back. So i got the lil bobcat loader filled her up and when she came back she was a sweet as pie.

terminal,Hello all its been a year since i started Chemo and found out i had cancer. 26 chemo cycles later it still sucks. After having many tumors i am down to one which shocked everyone but that one grew to twice it's size so the put me back on both chemo drugs again. Yes you can live with cancer but its not fun. My blood work is all normal and good overall health is good. They say other than the cancer i am healthy (still cant wrap my head around that) The tumor in my throat pretty much stopped me eating for awhile but thats gotten better. The 2 drugs i am on right now are Oxaliplatin and Fluororacil this is my seconds time on both. Not sure i am beating it but its still going. Live your life as you would always and enjoy the day.,reddit
terminal,Not sure if this fits here but. I fly r/c airplanes its a hobby and therapy for me due the fact i have cancer. Now i do chemo every other week and will for the rest of my life and i wear a chemo pump for 3 days that's powered by 4 double a batteries so after my 29th cycle i have gotten a pile of new and used double a batteries. I get 8 per cycle. Now on to the story. I took a big bag of the x2aa to the flying field to share and give away to members that wanted/needed them as all my planes and radios have rechargeable ones. After a while i saw they were all gone and i was happy to see them being put to use and not wasted. A few members said thanks and that's all i really heard till the next day. A man comes up and asks if i was the guy that brought the x2aa batteries and i said yes he then states he needs more of them and how soon can i get more. I was a little shocked but asked him to explain what he meant. He said he used radios at work and he was always buying them and he pretty much took all of them but needed more. For a perspective on how many he took was around of them 29 cycles x 8 batteries. Unlike so many posters here i am like a man on death row only difference is i am not in prison i know my time is short so my filter is gone if i offended you i really dont care anymore i live for me in the few years i have left. So i told the jackass to f off go away and leave me alone he starts ranting he needed these and i better get more or else. Wrong thing to say. I told him i am slowing dying from cancer and if he ever threatened me again he would regret it. He went to the club president and complained about me and they told him i had been a member for 19 years and i was sick and not to mess with me because i just dont care anymore and if he remained acting this way he would be removed from the club. So i figure it was over but NOPE. 2 days later i get a call from john the club president stating they removed him and banned him after he started calling members and was trying to get me kicked out of the club. All over some free double aa batteries that cost a few bucks. Some people just make me sick.,reddit

terminal,Today was my 33th chemo cycle. I went back and counted them all up to make sure. I was off but got it right and after the PETG scan looks like many more to do. My tumor is my throat which is 11/2 inches long is still same size but the density decreased a lot. The lymph nodes are still clear no tumors showing. Was told i am responding well to Chemo so they changed my chemo up too florouracil by pump every 2 weeks and one dose of Oxalipatin once a month. (they are doing this due to nephropathy in feet/fingers. Overall its looking better i hate the PETG scans then waiting for the results. I told my brother every one is like someone standing behind you with 1 shell in the cylinder 5 empty and they pull the trigger you one day its going to go off.

terminal,I been on here off and on for awhile. I took a break over the summer to enjoy the warm weather and have fun. Been building and flying my r/c planes and traveling to other clubs to fly. I have meet many people and have enjoyed this time. For those who have not read my other posts i will tell you about me. I have stage 4 throat cancer that metastasized to my lymph nodes i am incurable and inoperable or terminal in the Dr's words. The lymph nodes are clear now and the big tumor in my throat is back under control. How long i have i have no idea but this coming Monday will be my 34 cycle with both Fluorouracil and Oxalipltin once a month and the Fluorouracil by weekly thru a pump i wear for 46 hours. I have seen hope fears depression anger just about every emotion. Some shock me others not so much. Cancer is never a club anyone wants to join willingly but once you have it there are 2 outcomes you beat it or it beats you it really will not go any other way. I have seen people just shut down both physically and mentally wither away and die in my 16 months of fighting cancer. I have seen people rise above it and live on till the day comes that we all fear. My question which are you ? I will not allow cancer to dictate my life. I live around it and live with it but it does not rule me. I still go out i still spend time with friends and family i go flying and enjoy the day when i can. Yes chemo week sucks yes i get sick and sleep 60 to 80 hours yes i am dizzy and deep in the chemo fog but it lifts in a few days then life goes on. And that is my point life goes on. With or without cancer life will go on. You can embrace the time you have left or sit in the dark place cursing the world. Either is your choice. I would rather have one good day on my front porch talking to my neighbors and the college kids that walk by than being alone. I am not trying to be mean or downplay the emotions cancer brings on in people i was angry and depressed at first to but that lasted about a month then i said screw this i will live while i can. For those reading and still wondering if i am sure of what i am saying yes i am . My mother also passed from cancer she was given a year tops she made it 3 years 2 months before she died so i know whats coming for me i have seen the monster face to face i used to take her to the same cancer treatment center i go to now. ​ When people ask me about cancer i say its life and you have to live with it.

terminal,After 36 chemo treatments my cancer became resistance to the chemo. They started me on a new treatment thats a bio drug that seems to be working but who knows. After this there is nothing but hospice care. Its been a bad ride i fill up with fluid due to my lymph nodes being full of cancer so every 2 weeks they put a tube in my abdomen wall and pump out the fluid. the levels have been dropping so they think that its working but when it stops this will be the norm. I have been told this is my last year. I have taken care of my funeral and all arrangements are done. It's strange sitting with a funeral director while i am still alive and do all this but it needed to be done. I have not given up i am just dealing with reality that there is no hope but that does not mean there is no life. I will keep fighting the monster till it i wins.

I asked my Dr for a handicapped parking pass due to some days i feel really weak have issues walking far. Our social worker at the cancer center got me one that very day. ( i guess they can give them out) Anyway the very first time i used it i was at the grocery store getting some food. I Parked in the handicapped spot and started walking in And this 40 something woman asked me why i parked there. I said i have a permit that's all you need to know and walked away. She said I demand to know how someone that's healthy can just do that. I said i am not and just went inside. She marched up to me and said I called the cops you are getting a ticket you are lazy and disgusting. I Looked at her and asked her if she was going to waddled back to the herd and start grazing or was she ready for the slaughter house. The look on her face was pure shock. I said well when heifers are at her age they are either turned out to pasture or are shipped off for processing. One employee i knew came over told her to leave me alone that i had cancer and they called the manager over. She was escorted out of the store and told not to come back EVER! Yes the cops came and they talked to me. I explained everything and they said they were sorry i said no biggie and went and got my stuff. I hate Karen's !,reddit

Wanted to just see if there’s anyone on here currently doing their chemo without steroids now and what their experience has been with it. I’ve got bilateral AVN from my initial chemo treatment and am now on relapse treatment. I did my last few rounds of my initial chemo last year with 50% less Dex due to the AVN and I found no difference to my nausea. I’ve also always been able to eat food and keep my weight on throughout treatments even when I’ve been super nauseous. I’m just really sick of the steroid face and not being able to sleep + gaining weight like crazy when I exercise every day and do all the right things. My cancer is currently incurable so I’m just wanting to sleep better, feel better about myself and not be so upset every time I take a photo with my partner and see the horrible moon that is my face just glaring back at me. I’m also hopeful that I may be getting married soon? I’d like to just enjoy that and not feel like violet (blueberry version from Willy wonka) and just not myself. I know it’s all so trivial and vain but so many other things are outside of my control already and as much as I try I cannot stop caring about how I look and it’s really getting me down as I try enjoy my last year or whatever of life.",reddit

I had my chemo pushed back two weeks due to wanting to do a quick trip overseas and Christmas falling in the middle of the chemo round. I was due for my new round on Monday of CT for my relapse in my lungs, recent scans had shown a mixed response so we were going to do one more round before scanning again mid January. Couple days ago I started getting some tightness in my chest and a bit of pain there when coughing or taking a deep breath in (pain would start halfway through the breath. Monitored it and came home early then spiked a fever the other day so went to ER. They gave me fluids and antibiotics as well as did an Xray and CT to see if there was any infection in my lungs. Although no infection they did find new tumors in my lung lining, I haven’t had tumors here before. They pretty much just sent me home and I see my oncologist on Monday before I’m supposed to be doing chemo. I’m not too sure what’s going to happen to that now. The pain in my lungs remains and I’m starting to freak out a little, anyone who has had tumors in the lung lining has this affected whether you can do radiation? Has this also caused other health issues faster? I think the next chemo I can do is IT, then there’s one more covered after that before id have to try cabo which will cost me $11, every two months.

My oncologist doesn't want to do surgery I scheduled a thoracic surgeon appointment Monday in another state he also does lung suffision. So I'm going to talk to him because the one thing I need to have a chance to beat this is surgery. It sounds like the thoracic surgeon wants to do surgery and if that's the case I'm going to do it.

I have my first child 2 yrs old, a baby boy like I always imagined and wanted now the thing hat I wanted for so long likely to be very shortened. I'm trying my best to find a way to get ned as I heard alot of people with my diagnosis beat cancer after being told (inoperable, 2 weeks to live , maintaience therapy) yet they decided to get aggressive and find surgeons who will operate etc. I'm going to do all that and I feel like I can beat this. But I think realization is setting in that I will likely not win or the odds are not in NY favor. I had 1 rd of capox (very effective) now I'm doing avastin and capecitabine. My oncologist said no surgery because since it'd in the liver and lungs but I've seen many people here get several resection so I decides to go to Rosewell with Dr. Todd. I going to do the surgery regardless of what my primary oncologist says. His goal is just maintaience I am 5 months diagnosed and the idea of not being here with my wife who I had been with since I was 20 and she was 19. My son my dear boy I want to see him grow. I'm trying to stay faithful that I'm going to beat this but it's hard. Please anyone who has had my diagnosis mets (lungs and liver) I need you to give me strength to fight this please. I need to hear this isn't a waste of time and that fighting can actually change the precieved outcome.

I spoke to Dr.Demmy Todd and I sent him my scan and from the talk he wanted to have a appointment so we can talk about surgery. I meet with my liver surgeon next week who is aggressive so I'm that after he sees my scans that he will do surgery or give me a road map to being a candidate. I was going back and forth on if I should wait until my 2nd scans to look to try to get surgery as my oncologist did I was inoperable( I know that can change) but after talking to surviors they all wanted surgery found surgeons who would do it and now they are cured. Please have me in your thoughts that I find Dr's who are willing to do the surgeries. I really think i will and I honestly feel like I will beat this if they can just get this crap out of my body. I know a recurrence is possible but I truly feel I can beat this if I have surgery.,reddit

terminal,I had a MRI protocol done so the rectal surgeon can see exactly how much he needs to cut out but my primary tumor is all but gone so are the spots in my liver are also all but gone. It's great news they will do 5 days of intensive radiation to make sure the primary is completely gone if that works only liver surgery and lungs. My liver surgeon is just going to just cut and burn the area the 3 spot were at to make sure its totally gone as well. After I recover I will have surgery to get rid of my one lung met. My liver surgeon says I'm in the best possible position to beat this. I have not had any new mets when I found out (April ) to when I started treatment in July. I'm very optimistic that I will beat this I have so far responded very well and my primary and my liver are pretty much cleared. I know I still have a ways to go but do far things are looking great!

He tries to do his best for everyone, making decisions that affect others while assuming everyone will be okay with it because the people involved get along. But when things go wrong, he becomes overwhelmed with guilt and anger. He feels like everyone is against him. I think he’s masking the fact that he’s doing what’s easiest for him, trying to please everyone. I told him that good intentions still have consequences, and facing them is part of the process. It’s important to put yourself in others' shoes *beforehand* to avoid these situations. Not everyone—no matter how cool they are—sees things the way he does. It’s frustrating to hear him complain, and it’s hard for me to tell him that he’s also responsible. It’s not just that the world is unfair and that he’s always the victim.",reddit

Has anyone else found a resolution or a way around this.",reddit

terminal,Exhausted my FMLA and went out on long term disability for cancer. Microsoft notified me that I was laid off and my position eliminated. Everyone else on my team got new roles except me. MS legal and private attorney both say Microsoft has technically colored within the lines and there is too much difficulty to prove the case. I'm totally fucked. Meanwhile our landlord had been offering us a discounted rate for rent but turns out it was given as a loan and he sent us a bill for $30k so now we're going to be evicted. Our credit is too bad to get a new place and even if we could my LTD income is not guaranteed. The odds of me ever working again are near nil.

terminal,"can you imagine if you went to an AA meeting and it was mostly family members of alcoholics speaking? what if half the people at every meeting came to announce that their loved one died from alcoholism, gave the graphic details of how awful it was, and then left? and addiction is not a choice but in this case even with meetings and strength and support, I can't avoid dying from my disease. I never realized everything centered around other people's experience with cancer. you cannot easily find a support group for people who only have cancer. how odd is that? when you have cancer I suppose everyone is your caregiver. is my mom still my caregiver? she works so I mostly threw up by myself all day while on radiation. she makes my step dad dinner every night - he's healthy. is she his caregiver? she washes his clothes and goes shopping for him. am I inherently more burdensome because I'm ill? was I my grandmother's caregiver when I just visited her and hung out? some are really caregivers, of course. but the term is overused, imo. some people are relatives, or friends. I am taking care of myself, I'm left to fend for myself. I've learned that cancer is a balancing act of what to say. don't talk about the bad side, in a cancer support group or with friends or with strangers - that's negativity. your suffering is scaring people. no one likes to think about that. grief posting is fine though. cancer is sad and people have to get it off their chest. I have watched people so many times tell those with cancer that they need to stop crying. they need to get a grip and grow up and move on. I don't advise that we should all wallow in it. but when are the grieving supposed to move on? do you respond the same way to them? I read that said someone was my age and they felt it was not fair that their loved one was dying. after all, they said - they were only my age! not supposed to lose a loved one when you're that young. their life is over, it's unlived. I don't disagree it's very sad and needing of support somewhere. but it's an interesting thing to read when you are the same age, the one who will die relatively soon, the one who will not live that life and are regularly told: your life is not over, stop saying it is. you are making a big deal out of things. why are you even sad about this? you need to move on, and pretend you are not dying, until you do die. When I posted about how I do not feel particularly lucky to be dying at the same age I got a response that duh - stupid cancer patient - they are saying you are lucky that you will not die in 3 weeks! be grateful! I'm simply surprised that attitude is not extended to those who are not ill at all. most days I hate that cancer is such a cultural Thing. I struggle to think of the perfect analogy. I don't know if there is one. but people die, parents die, grandparents die. I'm not arguing that it isn't terrible and upsetting. but it is odd to me that people with a disease have to exist in spaces where people are allowed to flit by and say ""x died from this specific thing and it was so terrible. your disease is terrible and deadly"" don't people regularly complain of saying ""omg, x died of cancer"" why is it so different in a support setting where most are vulnerable? patients are not handled with the same kid gloves. when they are, it is seen as unfair coddling to those around them, seen as exclusionary. everyone has a right to be as involved in your cancer as you are - and if you have a complaint, a rant? the classic line: they only want the best. my mom today complained about how my grandmother's oncologist spent all his energy on the patients. I had a bit of an internal laugh about that one. I know that it's awful to have a loved one die and I know caregiving is not easy. but you don't know what it's like unless you have it. you don't have the right to say treatment is easy when you haven't been through it. I've been called cruel for literally simply speaking about 'a grim and deadly disease' and saying that treatment is in fact, not fun or easy - by someone who did not have said disease. I'm certainly aware that it's grim. though if I called my own disease that I am sure I would get many responses that stats are outdated and useless, and I may live forever. my question there is this: if treatment is so easy and painless, why do you describe yourself as a caregiver? do healthy non suffering people need caregivers? if survival rates are so outdated and do not apply to anyone, why are you mourning in advance? if having cancer is so terrible for everyone around me, why is it not terrible for me to have it? I remember being a very depressed young teen and having a really dark thought: I wish I had cancer. I wish people understood I was suffering. If I had some illness they would understand, they would empathize with me. It wouldn't all be in my mind. As I grew up I mostly realized that was bs. But you really don't realize how lonely cancer is until you have it. some days I miss being alone in my suffering without people thinking they understood and speaking on my behalf. I don't disagree that caregivers ever come to cancer spaces, fwiw. I appreciate when people are seeking to help a loved one with diet choices or pain relief. And I understand that it's devastating to watch someone go through something terrible. there definitely needs to be support for all. My dad is disabled and suffering and thinking of it makes me instantly cry. I do things for him a lot. I just cannot imagine going to an amputee support group and going up to the mic and saying ""hey, so I still have all my limbs, but I just wanted to explain that watching you go through this is really hard for me. It makes me very miserable to think about how you guys are suffering. I also know someone who died from amputation, and it was very terrible to watch. But you guys should be strong and get through this! I'm here to answer questions because actually my dad had it really easy, he never even cried to me! Ta"" idk. as I've said, I don't think we should be told to wallow in our misery. but I often feel pretty gaslighted - if everyone around me is suffering by virtue of watching me suffer. how am I lucky? are they not lucky too? after all, their loved one could die in 6 months - some have 3 weeks! pick your head up. I feel like if I said that to the grieving parent I'd be pretty immediately knocked down a peg, and rightly so. I doubt anyone will read this all and if anyone does I'm sure I will be met with a lot of disagreement, but whatever. I'm grateful for the kind people I've met. this isn't particularly coherent because I have so many thoughts on it all. I speak for myself but I will say I find it funny that if you go to a chat, people will largely say they do not check support groups anymore. I just wanted to say my peace before I prob leave this area or take a break at least because no place feels made for patients, at all. Maybe that's cruel. But cancer is cruel, and a very lonely thing, no matter how many people are around you and no matter how badly they're suffering.",reddit
terminal,"I posted on the gen cancer board but forgot that every time I rant there the same person blames me for everything. I honestly do just want someone to be like wow that sucks I'm sorry for you instead of telling me everything is my fault. idk who will read this and im probably going to cringe later but im upset lol I've been struggling so much trying to get psych care, I got diagnosed with GBM in , yes it's the ""good"" kind and I'm not dead yet but it feels like my own body is trying to kill me because it is and I feel trapped and really broken by all the treatment and just Tired. a nurse (who I'm friendly with, she isn't in oncology but I see her for something else) asked if I would do optune or similar when I have recurrence and I was just like. I am so goddamn miserable as it is I cannot imagine even doing the treatment I did before again, let alone that. I'm not really worried about recurrence as a general thing but if I had one tomorrow I think I might be brave enough to be like fuck no you're not dragging me through this again. It's been ridiculously hard to find a doctor, I had one at the cancer center who barely did anything for me anyway tbh but at least we tried some new meds. then he randomly sent a letter saying he left anyway. and then the new one isn't covered under my insurance, naturally. I understand my cancer center not being able to help in a different state but a ""palliative expert"" neuro oncologist being like ""haha well good luck with that"" about finding psych help makes me cry to think about like. it's really a joke to everyone. maybe because I've been sad for so long they just don't think it's a major issue? but like. I just feel worse and worse and no one gives a fuck unless they can operate on me everyone says to ask for help even me, I tell people that and then I can't even get myself a single psychiatrist appointment after six months. I was so proud of myself for finally telling my cancer center how bad I felt and I felt totally dismissed, today I was so relieved we finally seemed to get through to the right place and it turned out the doctor referred me for some speech therapy type exam not counseling/psychiatry. and they're like again it's a really long wait. at what point do I not have to wait like I literally do not want to be alive and have access to medicine fairly regularly. and I HAVE been waiting for six months. im sick of the distress forms and the pain scales and making it clear that i dont like being alive and i wish i wasnt and then when you ask for help theyre like well its apparently such a long wait that we cant even give you a date. i wonder who actually gets in or maybe terminal just puts me at the back of the line bc they figure ill die anyway. i literally WANT to live my life and do better and go to school or something but i cant do that when im so depressed and anxious and tired and unfocused. im just trying not to kms in the meantime while someone decides its my turn im just so tired sorry, I wish people just sympathized instead of telling me that it's my fault and that I have to suck it up because everyone else is dealing with the same thing. i think no not everyone is dealing with the same thing, i feel so isolated and like alienated and even if im not the only one which i know im not it doesnt mean it doesnt suck to be like begging for help and everyone is just living their life, it feels so awkward even saying i have cancer like as if ive done something wrong. idk if im supposed to call the place now and rant that i need help Now or if they wont even listen to that. if I call about my shoulder replacement I can have an appointment in 3 days, but you hate your life and can't even get an appointment in like a year apparently? i dont know what the hell to do to make doctors listen that i CANT wait anymore.",reddit
terminal,"feel like I'm saying it all the time here lol but I have a brain tumor, the thing is the prognosis is bad, and I just get flat shut down by people when I talk about it. I keep deleting a whole very long paragraph about the stats bc it's so hard to summarize but basically it's ( for it to not come back at all the outlook is *generally* not good for me and this is not a case of stats being very outdated when standard of care for this has not changed in 20 years. it's still being debated if they should even bother giving people like me the standard of care chemo! an even newer debate is if there was even a point of me taking the chemo during radiation. so yeah recurrence in 5 years or so (2 now) doesn't directly mean death sentence, I have friends who have made it through one, but it's still really bad, not a lot of options beyond hoping it's not a lot worse and you can get it with surgery, and that's just ignoring treatment symptoms and focusing on actual time left what's frustrating is most of the time I feel SO alone because it's like no one will acknowledge this even if I talk about it. I don't want to be reminded daily that I'm kind-of-dying but I'm also frustrated at feeling. idk the word gaslighted comes to mind even though I don't want to misuse that, but close. like as in I know the facts yet people esp. my mother go so hard just telling me you're wrong you're wrong it's fine you're going to live forever those stats aren't real ) and I'm a little like oh am I crazy? like I think I'm terminal but honestly I also feel like I don't even know? terminal means likely to die right and I am I believe? and everything says that but also people make me think I'm somehow wrong even when I know the info like I can't confidently make a statement as if I'm somehow misreading. it's crazy bc if a caregiver for this speaks in brain cancer groups then suddenly oh it's really scary and terrible and death comes on so fast and no one survives this and blah. but if I talk as a patient oh well you know be positive about it, it's all fine. ) even when I ask my onc any q along the lines of survival I feel like it annoys him that I'm being ""negative. that's prob largely my own self consciousness but it just feels like no one wants to talk about how bad it is unless it's a caregiver oriented discussion in which case oh it's dark as hell. like somehow I have a cancer where when opting for a hip replacement the doctor is like ""oh. um this is personal. but is there like. a prognosis"" and nurses and PAs and whoever can't hide their shock or sadness or w/e when I say it. where any support group they have to explicitly be like pls stop posting pics of your relatives on their deathbed. yet everything's definitelyyyyyy going to be fine! idk this is so long though I tried to make it not. if anyone reads and has any words I'd appreciate it I guess. like does anyone feel similar or get it? I'm just tired of feeling crazy tbh. like honestly I know there are worse things but I feel like I don't even get the default omg cancer/terminal pity it's like oh I'm delusional for being sad? which makes the sadness worse. not like I want to live every moment thinking about dying, that's part of why i take breaks from here etc. but idk.

I say I can barely get out of bed, I have no activity level, he's just like ️ they scheduled surgery for dec and told me that everywhere in the area was booked too and that even the december 20th date would most likely get moved out to january or later. had to sit there sobbing in front of two med students while we scheduled that. spicing up their ortho rotations for sure. not that I wouldn't be upset about that too but they didn't even bother telling me to try OTC pain meds or something. asked if there's anything at all they can do for the pain and he was like nope.

I have terminal lung cancer and I developed pneumonia behind the tumor in my left lung. It then developed abscesses that the antibiotics could not penetrate. After trying to treat it unsuccessfully for weeks the decision was made that my only chance was a serious surgery in which they would go into my lung and scrape it out, leaving chest tubes to drain out the junk. They told me that the surgery had a high mortality rate and that if I survived I would be in ICU for days afterward. I went for it. I woke up with 3 large chest tubes coming out of my back, and I was in a world of pain. Luckily I managed to recover quickly, spending a week after the surgery in the hospital and then being discharged to home! I’m on IV antibiotics for the next month at home and I have lung exercises that I do here at home also. We are hopeful that the infection is being wiped out for good. I just wanted to share my situation to give others some hope. I’m grateful and happy to share this. Praying that the past 19 days in the hospital have “fixed” me! All appreciation goes to my surgeons and doctors and one awesome PA.",reddit

I was set to go back to work Nov 15th. I was fired Nov. 8th. My FMLA had run out and they were getting rid of my position at work. I was devastated, but hey, I'm alive. I survived cancer, I can get another job. I was scheduled for a PT scan to check my progress and make sure I was NED, but about two weeks before I was violently ill and ended up going to the hospital for severe dehydration. I was terrified it was linked to my treatment or that something was wrong. They did a CT scan, checked me over, ran tests. It wasn't at all what I was expecting. Nope, it turns out I was 5 weeks pregnant and experiencing severe morning sickness. We went to the OB and she said I can't have a PT scan because it isn't safe for the baby. She suggested an MRI. I called my surgical oncologists office and let them know what was going on and they never got back to me regarding an MRI. I told them I could bring in my CT scan results and Ive heard nothing. It's an hour and a half drive to their office from where I live. I let them know I couldn't afford the office copay due to the loss of my job and that I don't have the gas to drive there and back and begged them to get back to me. I was contacted by a social service worker who told me to fill out a form and they MIGHT be able to wave the fee at the doctors office. I finally got the form in the mail two days ago. I don't know if I'm NED. I don't know if I still have to worry about my cancer. I don't know if the chemo and radiation worked. I'm in limbo, jobless, pregnant, and scared.

She's a CNA, was there to help take care of our house while I was in the hospital during my cancer treatment and recovery, and is going to help us get the house ready for baby boy. I'm due in July.

She was his main maternal figure for 7 years. Then I came along. I wouldn't dream of trying to break the bond they have and I have my own. Healthy and happy relationship with SS. DH was very young and working two jobs to support his ex and the baby so when his ex dipped and while MIL watched the baby, he continued to work and provide for his child. SS is autistic, has separation anxiety, and adores MIL. Cool cool. I let her know that will not be the case with my LO. Needless to say, we've come to a fantastic resolution (for us anyway) and MIL can do what she wants. Throw the baby shower. She said it wasn't about me. Absolutely right, it's not. I won't be attending. My DH will, though. Gotta keep the peace somehow. Things are going to get really ugly when MIL discovers she isn't planning bday parties for my baby. I've decided that, no. I don't care. I don't care how upset she gets, how she thinks of or sees me, or how big of a fuss she causes. I have fought too damn hard the last few years, with NO support from her, to get where I am and I am FINALLY getting to have MY baby.

The end is close and I swear it's worth it, but it's not as easy as just being happy it's gone. There are side affects. I'm proud of all of us. We are survivors and so are our babies.

terminal,"My water broke at 36w4d. I had wanted a natural labor and delivery, however my baby was having a lot of issues during my labor and after 4 hours of monitoring, they decided a C Section would be the best course of action to keep my baby and myself safe. I vomited until I was pulled back into the OR and I was put under general anesthesia. When I woke up I had a beautiful baby boy.and no nausea. I was elated and overjoyed.until it came time to eat something. The panic attack snuck up on me. I have spent every day of the last 2 weeks an anxious mess when it comes to eating. I can't eat or drink anything without the fear of being sick again. It takes me hours to finish any type of food and I cry halfway through every time. I also am only eating one meal a day. I'm on antianxiety meds and anti depressants. I have severe PPD and PPA. My baby is amazing. He doesn't cry much, sleeps well, eats well, he's a superstar. While I haven't thrown up since giving birth, the fear and trauma lingers. My doctors say they're going to work with me on this as well as my other mental health issues, but damn. I was so ready to be done with HG. But it still affects me every day. I'm dealing, but not living. This illness is rough. You aren't alone. There's nothing ""wrong"" with you. And it may not go away immediately. It has an affect on us, all of us. Just know you aren't alone.",reddit

non-terminal,"February 19, On February 14th, I was officially one year cancer free. It’s a big deal, I know, but hold your applause. It was a date I almost missed, a date that went along without any pomp or circumstance, because I am not “better. Don’t panic. This isn’t a post to let you all know that I’ve relapsed (again) or that some other scary disease (I’m looking at you UCLA superbug) has taken over my body. This is a post to talk about something I’ve mentioned before, but definitely not enough. Being cancer free does not mean being “better” On February 3rd I woke up at 6am because I couldn’t breathe. I’d had a sore throat for a few days that I’d been ignoring, but that morning I had no choice but to acknowledge that something was wrong. There was a pain in both my lungs, so sharp, that it was almost impossible for me to get in any air. I took my temperature, . I called my cancer center, who told me to call an ambulance. I called for the first time in my life (surprising, I know, and was taken to the closet ER. Here, I need to go off track for a moment, and talk about how privileged I have been to have received treatment from some of the top hospitals in the world. I’ve always known how lucky I am to be treated in world class hospitals by doctors who are not just brilliant, but kind, doctors who listen to their patients. In the ER of a downtown Los Angeles hospital (which I’m not naming because I don’t want to get sued or something, I don’t know how this works) I received a sharp awakening call. I told them my medical history (all while still fighting to breathe) and explained that something similar had happened before and that a very specific pain medication would eradicate the problem long enough to start looking for what was wrong with me. They ignored me. I listened to them repeat my medical history incorrectly “she had some kind of transplant” “they removed a tumor from her chest) without the breath to correct them. I sat in a hallway while patients with various illnesses walked around me, and no one offered me a mask, despite my insistence that I have an autoimmune disorder. When my IV was accessed, the nurse didn’t cap it properly, and blood poured from the tube until I brought it to his attention. When my regular oncologist found out where I was he told me to tell them I was feeling better so I could be discharged immediately, and to come to the center at Cedars. The doctor wrote me a prescription for a fucking ZPAK and sent me on my way. I made it to my hospital and have never been happier to see such friendly, competent faces. People who know me and care about me. I will never stop reiterating how grateful I am to these men and women who take such good care of me. I was given the proper medicines, admitted to the hospital, and eventually diagnosed with RSV, a respiratory virus only children get (my immune system still isn’t fully grown up yet. I was in the hospital just over a week, missing 7 classes. But then came the fun part, recovery. Because when you leave the hospital you aren’t just “better"" For 3 days I sat in bed watching Netflix while Ben (my wonderful, wonderful boyfriend) made me soup and brought me tissues and let me cry when I got frustrated because just walking to the kitchen felt like running a half marathon. We had plans to go to Palm Springs that weekend for Valentine’s Day, and despite my poor health, we decided to keep those plans. My doctor even said, as if I were a ’s housewife, that a break from all the smog and stress of the city would be wonderful for my health. So we went. And we came back. And I still wasn’t able to go to my classes this week. And that is where things get tricky. Being ""better” is all about perception. A weekend in Palm Spring should mean I’m well, right? I posted pictures of us laying by the pool, we even went out to dinner one night. I must be fine! But that’s not how it works. That hour by the pool was the only time I got out of bed that day, and after dinner? After dinner I had to wait in the car while Ben made a Ralph’s run because I felt like I was going to pass out if I walked more than 20 steps. I have a bad habit of posting my good days on social media. Or maybe its a good habit, because I post the days I want to remember. But the problem is that every day is not an Instagram post. I’ve had to bail on birthday dinners and friendly brunches because I literally can’t get out of bed without falling over, and I’ve gotten responses like “you were fine last weekend” or “you seemed okay when you were drinking that sangria the other night” Some days I wake up and feel great and go for a jog (I’m kidding, that part never happens) and make it to all my classes and do all my homework and have dinner with friends and pay all my bills on time, but some days I wake up and everything hurts and just getting out of bed to pee feels like the hardest thing in the world. So no, I am not “better” I’m posting today because all of this really came to a head this morning. I was planning on going back to classes today, I even made an appointment to meet with one of my professors before class (Dane, if you’re reading this, I’m sorry and I’m emailing you next. I didn’t get as much work done as I wanted to yesterday but I was still feeling okay. I woke up early to do some more this morning and about an hour in I started to panic. What if it wasn’t enough? What if I never caught up? What if I tried to walk to class and passed out on the way because I hadn’t tried walking that far yet? What if I passed out IN class? What if something happened and I wound up back in that emergency room? And so, I had a panic attack. I cried in the shower for 15 minutes and tried to calm myself down but I couldn’t breathe and couldn’t make it stop so I took a xanax and just kept shaking and crying until it kicked in and I fell back asleep. And I missed another day of classes. I don’t want this to be a sad post. I don’t want this to be a pity post. Because I am getting better. I’m just not there yet. So when I cancel on plans or don’t answer your text for a week (or never) and then insist that I’m doing fine when I run into you on campus, just keep in mind that my recovery is a lot of things, but black and white isn’t one of them.",tumblr

I decided that I want to document everyday so that my feelings can be put to words and put out of my mind so that it’s easier to stay positive. Today I had a bunch of tests done ct scans ultrasounds blood test and the most horrible a biopsy. During my very painful biopsy, I wasn’t sedated and I must mention they used a very large needle. They let me listen to music so of course Paramore️ was my go to band. I listened to Last hope from their self titled album. My friends told me to hold on to those lyrics and I did.

Over the past couple of days I have been preparing for the worst, so this visit with the specialist today was a breath of fresh air. I should note that while I’ve been given a somewhat optimistic prognosis for the time being, I still have to get more tests done that will paint a clearer picture of the months to come.

So crazy to think that two years ago I was sitting in an Oral surgeons office waiting for news about my biopsy. For two years I had been told oh nothing is wrong except an infection or you need a tooth pulled when in reality it was so much more. Finally i found a dentist who referred me to a great local Ora surgeon. I got the scariest news of my life. That I had cancer. The cancer I had was one no one local had seen in a 21 year old at the time I was told it was something a 60+ year old would have gotten. Therefore no one would treat me in my area. I found a great surgeon/oncologist who I hated as a person and he and I have butt heads many times. He was rated TOP Doctor several times and he was arrogant about it and I was determined to make him less arrogant. Although I didn't see it at the time. He was quick to schedule me to have the tumor as well as part of my jaw removed to help me into remission. Because of him even though it was stage two and radiation was suggested I only needed surgery. In less than a month I will be 2 years cancer free thanks to this man. It literally took me until 6 months ago to get along with him and be able to be civil. He is literally my favorite doctor at this point other than my primary. Feeling so many emotions today. It hasn't been the easiest of recoveries because of all of my other health issues, loose teeth and jaw issues from the cancer and because I've had several cancer scares along the way but he's been there to do what he could to make sure it hasn't returned even though he was almost certain that it would because he found precancerous cells.

There are a few clinical studies I’ve dug up of successful pregnancies over the last few years following the type and cancer and treatment I had, which gives me some hope.

non-terminal,"Why? I have recently found out that one of the sweetest people I have ever met in my life is sadly losing her long painful fight against cancer. Even through her illness she always makes people smile and tries her best to participate in everything like the other kids. She is a very strong girl, she has always been and has fought through her battle hard.Here’s a bit of her cancer story, Emma was nine years old when she was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer on 1st October after a short illness. She had an immediate surgery to release the pressure on her brain caused by the build up of fluids, and shortly afterwards had a second surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible. The second operation removed % of the squash ball sized tumour. Immediately after the second surgery Emma started a grueling course of radiation therapy which lasted six weeks. With a short break over the Christmas period to recuperate from the radiation therapy, Emma then commenced a six cycle chemotherapy regime that was to last seven months.The treatments were administered at British Columbia Children’s Hospital in Vancouver. During the treatments the Emma’s parents stayed for short and long periods at the Ronald McDonald House in Vancouver, often away from their son Charlie who was seven when Emma was first diagnosed.In August after further MRI scans, Emma and her family were told that Emma was in remission and that there was no evidence of cancer. Emma began her road to recovery from the ravages of the radiation and chemotherapy treatments, which had taken their toll on her body and mind.Emma seemed to be doing well, but in August started to have spells of being unwell, culminating in suspected meningitis. The illnesses did not recede with treatments, and as the family became more anxious further test were made. On 1st October , exactly two years after the first diagnosis, Emma and her family were informed of the devastating news that cancer had been found in Emma’s spine. Emma was officially in relapse and very ill. After a short round of radiation therapy Emma was once again placed into a chemotherapy regime. I know that I and many others are fearful she will not make it through. I am so sad that the amazing Emma hasn’t got to have a “normal” life and grow up without a worry but it seems that some of the most beautiful souls have to leave us behind too early. I know she will remain with us in our hearts, minds and everything we do. we love and will miss you Emma, thank you for all the great laughs and smiles… if you would like to read more about her story or fund her campaign here is the link-",tumblr

non-terminal,"Story of Sai: A Two-Time Cancer Survivor By Marisse Lee Sai Belloan, a young lady aged 21, is one of those souls I happened to meet by serendipity in the virtual world of Facebook. A twist of fate, I would like to call it that way. If you check out her FB profile she would strike you as just another normal young woman who likes Game of Thrones and, most likely, has a crush on Kit Harington (lol, now, who wouldn’t anyway; dogs; Justin Bieber (oh go and love yourself; Friends(again, who wouldn’t; and must have, once recently, fall madly in love with K-Drama(Korean drama TV series) and the Ken-doll like Korean actors. Pretty much like everyone in her age in this country, I bet. She is blessed with a lovely face and a lovely family. She is the youngest of two siblings borne from a family who earns their living from manufacturing shoes and bags. She was, therefore, living a normal and comfortable life until this huge challenge came along in her life at the age of 15. She was afflicted with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma . The Mayo clinic described it as: “a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of your immune system. In Hodgkin’s lymphoma, cells in the lymphatic system grow abnormally and may spread beyond the lymphatic system. As Hodgkin’s lymphoma progresses, it compromises your body’s ability to fight infection” Its symptoms include fever, night sweats and weight loss and oftentimes, the presence of a non-painful enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, under the arm or in the groin area. Feeling tired and itchiness may be felt by those affected with this type. In Sai’s case, the symptoms consisted of itchy skin, persistent dry cough for 3 months (the phlegm was laced with blood in the latter stage, fatigue and a lump in her neck that was biopsied (via sample taken thru needle-aspiration) but with negative result. However, after surgery and another biopsy, the lump turned out as positive. She went through a treatment consisting of 4 cycles of chemotheraphy. Note that HL type of cancer has a high survival rate especially in the case of young patients. She recovered and was cancer-free for the next 4 years. She graduated valedictorian from high school and went to University of Sto. Tomas to study BS Finance. She was enjoying a carefree life like any teenager…but, BOOM! Just like that, cancer re-appeared. Everyone had, one time or another, a brush with pain and sorrow. We all learn to deal with it, let go and then move on. However, nothing will ever prepare for anyone to have another tryst with the same demon. That would be devastating to say the least. You already looked this devil in its eyes. You weathered the storm…and yet, it is back. Staring you in the face. Initially, Sai worried that she might undergo stem-cell-transplant, a treatment that is being touted as highly effective in treating cancer cases (I have different un-expert opinion on this matter but it is irrelevant to discuss it here so let us save that for another day) but it is quite expensive in the Philippines (approximately $50, or more. Fortunately (financially speaking, her doctors put her under the first-line-of-defense treatment which means she had to undergo 6 cycles of chemotheraphy to get rid of the cancer cells. A trip to the hospital for each cycle which is equivalent to 2 sessions is a “trip to hell”according to Sai. She was in constant pain. What with being poked by needles so many times to insert the IV-line…when a battered vein refused to take in the meds, they will simply poke another one to go on with the treatment. I will never understand how a 21-year old was able to handle all that. But she did. After each session, she would hurt from the side effects of chemotherapy: bone/muscle/body pains, shortness of breath and soreness of veins. Alongside with that, she had suffered “moon face” (steroids side effect, uncontrolled eating and insomnia. But, thanks to God, she is, again, in remission – free from cancer once more. Now, why the heck am I writing this story? Well, people, cancer is not just like having a flu, recovering from it, then going back to your routine. NOT AT ALL. Sai was in college when her HL cancer recurred. She was building her dreams…looking forward to finishing school because she remembered how happy and proud her parents were when her older sister graduated from the university. She wanted to make them proud of her also. A typical dream of a child who dreamed of somehow paying back their folks’ sacrifices. She hoped to get ahead in life as that is what we were raised to do. One has to make a place under the sun. Cancer provided her a choice-less choice but to quit school. She is cured, yes…still, she lives life with Damocles sword over her head afraid that the cancer may recur a third time. She is scared of having dreams for herself again because one day she might wake up losing them once more. She worried about her parents because they are getting old and she would not like to see them earning and putting up money for her treatment. She posted a long recount of her cancer tale on 22 July putting up a brave face against this odd…what she did not tell you much about is that she lives everyday like someone near a cliff…anxious, frightened to fall in that abyss. Cancer changes a person. It makes you brave because you have no other recourse but to embrace courage. It makes you treasure life more because you have tasted what it is to almost lose it. It makes you cherish the people in your life because you are not sure how long is your time to share and spend with them. Nonetheless, at the same time, you always live with fear…less for yourself but more for the people you love and might leave behind. It is a harrowing tale that will continue to unfold every day of her life. It will take a very long while for her body to completely recover and regain back its maximum health…it will probably take double that time for Sai to be completely confident that things will be really okay. She is thankful for the friendships she gained (strangers and otherwise) while she has been going through this challenge. Misery loves company, true. It may be “misery” but, from there, compassion and love bloom that only show our humanity in the face of adversity. Right now, she is taking her time to recover. She would have wanted to go back to school right away to avoid the additional two years (thus, additional expenses) she may incur as a result of the implementation of K-12 Program in the Philippines. However, I tried to reason out with her that there are more important things other than college education…and that, at this time, priority should be given to her health; it, being given back to her for yet another chance. I love to mention here that Sai learned watercolor drawing by herself from the YouTube University (pun intended) while she was sick. When I asked her the other day what is she keeping herself busy with, she said: “Painting my bedroom” Oh, the kid must be doing a Michelangelo on her ceiling, who knows? She also continue to share stories of her friends that are still battling with cancer and seeking financial assistance in the hope that by sharing their posts she might be able to help find a charitable soul who may be willing to extend help. She established a Facebook group for HL and non-HL cancer patients which you can find through this link . Lastly, Sai never lost her faith that God is there for her and her family. My goal in writing her story is not to educate you about cancer. Google can provide you with tons of information if you would like to read about it…neither am I seeking pity and consolation from you although understanding and compassion is very much welcome. If you are reading this, I am knocking at the door of love and kindness that reside in your heart, please hear my prayers: 1) I am begging you to show support to people who are suffering from cancer by sharing their stories especially those who are in need of financial assistance…that is the least we can do. By doing such, perhaps our efforts might lead to someone who has the means to help. It is shooting in the dark, yes, but who knows an arrow might find its way to the right heart. 2) If the cancer-patient is selling items to raise the money required for their treatment, we can either patronize his/her product or, again, help in the selling campaign (I do not have to remind you, though, to check authenticity of any such campaign before diving into it…Heaven knows how the Internet works these days. 3) If you have the financial means, kindly donate to their Go-Fund-Me 4) If none at all, sincere prayers will do. Humans are beings made of energy. Prayers are energy. You get the picture. Having said that, please start with Ramon Christopher “Casi” Ramos Burgos . He is Sai’s friend…another soul suffering from non-HL cancer that she happened to befriend in the cancer community. Originally, we intended to write a story for Casi but he has been confined in the hospital and not available to provide details that we need. By sharing Sai’s story, you will be sharing Casi’s battle with cancer as well. If you are able, please check his Go-Fund-Me at . Your financial help, whatever the amount, will be most appreciated. Or, if you are interested in ordering cancer-awareness t-shirts, you can check this link to place your order . PLEASE, I BEG YOU…share Sai’s story (and by that, sharing Casi’s plea) or kindly re-post Casi’s Go-Fund-Me link or help him raise the US$50, (it only has $ so far, a loooooong way to go) by promoting the sale of his t-shirts. A simple click, a simple share is all we are asking from you. Maybe somehow, somewhere it would get result.",tumblr
non-terminal,"Remission. After my doctor’s appointment today, it’s official - I’m in remission. All pre-surgery tests I had done along with the labs they took today all support the fact that I am currently cancer free. Generally speaking, if there is going to be any reoccurrence, the chances are highest that it’ll happen in the first 2 years. After that, it drops off dramatically until year 5 - which is when they really start to consider throwing the “c’ word around. To be clear, the “c” word I speak of is cured. We are a long way from that. But like most of this I am not even sure what the really means anyway - this isn’t like I had pneumonia or the chicken pox. All said though, all positive news! In terms of next steps, I do have a scan scheduled as a part of my now diligent monitoring regimen in late December/Early January. This also happened to be a really good appointment from the conversation I was able to have with Dr. Desai. So much of the focus is (obviously) put on the physical removal of the cancer and to eradicate it’s chance of spreading - but now that we are past that piece currently, no one lives in a vacuum. There are all kinds of outside elements that continue to influence and affect us as human beings. Now, how do we go about fully assimilating back into normal every day life with those factors involved? And that’s not to say that I have felt unassimilated. More so however, with what is it going to take for one to operate in a healthy fashion within the new normal that will be continuing dealing/thinking about things that people never having cancer, fortunately don’t have to experience? These new realities aren’t as, he said, easy things to flip a switch to. Instead, to think of this total recovery as a dimmer switch with a gradual turn up of light rather than the simple light switch of OFF then ON. My physical recovery is still something that is still very active - albeit for the most part internal. As he again reminded me, we are just 3+ months since my last chemo treatment and just a month outside of this last surgery - the body, biologically, takes time to recover. Much like training for a marathon, slow builds week over week over week is the key. What’s funny is that as the doctor telling me this, I’ve heard this all before - from many places in life. From personally in family & friends, to professionally from bosses and all the way back to baseball coaches…basics of the road to success. Incremental gains. One brick at a time. I suppose it is human to lose sight of this now and again. What I realized however was, that in this rush to get to and feel , I ended up losing sight of the gains that truly have been made. That this, as he again reminded me, has only all just been slightly over a year. A blip in the radar of life. Once the all the physical is restored over the course of the next months, the perpetual psychological journey continues. Dr. Desai also gave me some really good tips today about the continued slow ramp up of exercise, diet, meditation, and certain acupuncture treatments to help in complete holistic health. The challenge of finding the right alchemy and balance of it all only fuels my passion while continuing to make small little gains every day…",tumblr

non-terminal,"Aw, 14 months today since I was diagnosed with cancer. Met so many inspirational people and friends throughout this journey. These include many motivational speakers at the Find Your Sense of Tumour conference I attended last month - most of them just normal people who had had cancer as a teenager very recently, or a few years ago, and how they overcame various aspects. Sean Swarner, who’s often on news channels in America, did an amazing talk. He had the same cancer as me, in the most aggresive form. He beat that then had another, extremely rare cancer; was in a coma; and now has only one working lung, yet he’s climbed the highest mountain in every continent. He was the first cancer survivor to climb Mount Everest, and when he reached the summit, buried a flag with the names of cancer survivors who inspire him, there. Sean was amazing. I’ve met so many friends and am going to my second Teenage Cancer Trust concert at London’s Royal Albert Hall on Sunday, to see Jessie J. If I hadn’t had been diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma on 28th January , I wouldn’t have ever been as inspired as I was, by Becky Bishop. If my own cancer - which was the same type as Becky’s - had never happened, I’d still have seen her Wigless Wednesday gif on my dashboard on here, but it couldn’t have meant as much to me as I did due to my situation. RIP Becky. It’s her funeral on Saturday and I still can’t believe she’s gone. It’s so unfair. I know she is someone we can all learn from. ♥",tumblr

Cancer free, cancer in remission, currently under treatment but stable, and then of course, “I have cancer. With melanoma, there is probably little prospect of ever being declared cancer free. Its characteristics - capricious, prone to sudden outbursts after laying dormant, the lack of therapies that convincingly eradicate it or durably eradicate it, its immune system connection - mean that what one might hope for optimistically is to get rid of all evidence of it through surgery, shrinkage and disappearance of tumors through whatever biological therapy you are on. We’ve got to set ourselves up as having a chronic, long term disease, but one in which there is no evidence of disease for a long long time. And hope that maybe the last therapy really did the job and it truly is gone. Then we need to scientific community to continue to move forward and truly find a cure. So we want our threesome with Mel to be over. We are a nice couple, we’d have a great threesome with NED.",tumblr

non-terminal,"Words From A Cancer Survivor First off, I’d like to say that that is such a wonderful fucking phrase to be able to say; “I am a cancer survivor” I beat cancer, kicked the ever-living shit out of it, and chased it back to the island of misfits toys. That being said, the whole experience really tore me up. And it’s going to be a long time before I feel “normal” (whatever that means) again. The physical part of it was pretty bad. Not being able to sleep, constantly throwing up, and just lots of overall pain. Staying in hospitals and surgery and MRIs/CTs suck. But what really kills you, is the mental aspect of it all. The constant worrying about, well, everything. School, friends, your family, wanting to eat because you’re starving but you physically can’t, emotional imbalance, crying your damn guts out. And let me be the first to tell you, people will let you down during this process. They won’t be there for you and that sucks. It really does. But you start to really appreciate the people who are there for you. But for now, I’m okay. There’s a chance it could come back in a few years. There’s a good chance. And even if it doesn’t, it’s possible that my brain was adversely affected by the whole process. But for now, I am okay. There are still sleepless nights and tears and anger and all kinds of emotion that I can’t even describe. But for now, I am okay. So please, if you need someone to talk to, someone to lean on, or just someone to listen to you cry on the phone for hours, tell me and I will not hesitate. I understand.",tumblr

non-terminal,"Last Month! I woke up today and I realized something BIG. I don’t know why it didn’t hit me before, but it did today in a big jolt. It is my last month of chemotherapy. Wow… time really flies by fast when you are having fun. On March 29th I was given the news by my oncologist that I have no more cancerous activity inside of me. You would think that when someone tells you that you have no more cancer, you would go through this insane dramatic moment where you are probably doing the hakuna matata on top of your bed. Instead, the only response my doctor got from me was a very catatonic “oh alright” Dont get me wrong, I was and am definitely grateful, but for the longest time I had absolutely no idea how to emotionally feel about this news. Its hard to forget the past six months of my life. Probably 10 of the 14 days I am given in between chemo sessions, I am in bed, too sick and in pain to get out (although my body has gotten stronger with each passing chemo session and 10 has shortened to 7. Probably if I didn’t have pictures of me from before cancer I wouldn’t have remembered how I looked with hair. Probably I have spent so much time hooked up to an IV machine that the scars from the needles will never completely fade away. In that instant when I was given my remission news, I realized that even if cancer wasn’t inside of me anymore, Cancer and I will have a lifelong relationship. But with each passing day the news sinks in more and more and I can finally feel myself nearing towards the end of cancer. Its been really tough but I have gained more perspective of the real world in the past couple of months than I have in my entire life. If I could give one advice to anyone touched by cancer, its be patient and take it one day at a time. And DONT loose faith… ever . On a seperate note I know I haven’t written a cancer post for quiet a long time. I promised myself I would document this phase of my life and write for myself and for others. I did a terrible job at that, but I will still be updating this blog with cancer posts just many of them might be in the past tense…",tumblr

She proceeded to show me the stages and tell me which one I was in. A few days before Halloween in - cervical cancer, stage 2. I have never felt so tired in my life. I have never felt so helpless because it was something I couldn’t control. I have never felt so lonely because I didn’t know anybody who had it this young (I was diagnosed before I turned 30. I have never felt so frustrated (I was mentally done and everybody was breathing down my neck with questions, harping on me on how I should beat it, and harping on me for the simpliest of things - like staying up late. I have never felt so “this is my life now - everything else is out the door” because my main goal was to beat it. I had dreams. I had things I wanted to accomplish. I had places I wanted to visit. I had life goals. I cried for a solid 3 days before I could even pick myself up, take the medicine that I was told was going to make me sick. I thought it was a bad dream, as cliche as that might sound. I didn’t want to do it. As simple as that… I didn’t want to do it. But I had to. And I fucking did it. I lost a lot of my hair, my skin had hives, I was paler than I’ve ever been, I lost a lot of weight and gained it back quickly (it fluctuated out of this world, and I just couldn’t look at myself in the mirror. I bought wigs. I relied on eyelash extensions so I could feel normal. I cut my hair short so it didn’t look like I had a mullet. I airbrushed my skin a few times just so I could have pretty arms and legs until I took a shower. I lived in hoodies because of how forgiving they are, no matter what weight my body wanted to be at that week. I watched my money go $ at a time. I discovered chemotherapy was a heartless, but logical bitch. I couldn’t make myself feel beautiful, no matter how hard I tried - I felt ran over and thought I looked dehydrated and used up. I didn’t want to do it. I wanted it over with. But I fucking did it. I am STILL recovering from it all. It’s hard to see pictures of yourself before and see how much a thing like cancer took from you. A bastard like cancer. People will tell you “you are so beautiful, but it’s a process. To have long hair again? That would be the dream. To know for a fact that I’ll never have to go through it again? That would be the dream. To have a place on my own, despite the medical bills and the setback it put me at? That would be the dream. A damn dream. A dream I thought that would never happen many times while I took those godawful pills. But here we are. A new place. I can breathe here. I can decorate how I want to and look at every single piece that’s in my house and smile, saying “heh - remember when you thought the only room you’d get at one point was a hospital bed? Look” Yes, the fear of cancer coming back is always in the back of my mind. But right now… I can breathe here. I am proud of myself. If anybody is the most supportive and proud of myself… it’s me. I’ve always got me, I can be self-efficient. In the words of Lizzo and her song Soulmate, “I’m my own soulmate. I know that I’m always gonna hold me down” And that’s been proven time and time again. I’ve been told by a man that I would never have my own, that I was worthless. And he beat the shit out of me. And I had cancer tell me the same, also suffocating me. But I have proved those words to be false, even if my brain might want to say otherwise sometimes. I just want to look them both in the eye one day and say… “But I fucking did it”",tumblr

Yesterday we found out that our amazing friend Bret passed away after a 10 year battle with cancer. I first met Bret through Tumblr. I was newly diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and I was searching for someone, anyone who was going through the same thing. Bret’s blog was beautiful. He was an amazing writer, so caring, so honest. I didn’t feel so alone. I followed him and soon he followed me and we eventually messaged with words of support for our respective journeys. Even though we were both diagnosed with the same cancer, we’ve had such different experiences. His cancer came back, multiple times. This photo is from when we actually met in NYC. He and his wife Aura were in town to go to Sloan Kettering for I believe his second stem cell transplant and they were kind enough to to spend the afternoon with us. I was in the middle of my radiation treatments. He had gone through that and more so we all traded war stories. In a month I would finish my final cancer treatment and life would go back to normal. Although that as a cancer survivor is tricky in itself to navigate. Bret’s stem cell treatment would beat back the cancer, but leave him fighting a multitude of other problems that it caused. Yet through it all, I followed his journey. Aura and Bret have a beautiful 4 year old daughter named Evie, who is sweet, and smart, and funny. She tells amazing jokes. I’m at a loss as to how to put into words how sorry I am for their loss. Bret was caring and kind. His heart was open and honest. I’ll miss his writing, his excellent taste in music, and knowing that he was simply in the world. This loss has been hitting me in waves today and I will be feeling this for a while.

non-terminal,"Last Year I thought I was Going to Die. Before the age of 21, I can say I never really thought about death. If I did, it was in an almost hypothetical manner. As if the odds of myself or my friends dying anytime soon was about as likely as a global pandemic overcoming our planet and closing our nightclubs for two years(har har. I never really thought about death until it decided to wake me up one morning and stare straight into my face with its huge, overcoming darkness. Since its first appearance 14 months ago, it has taken on various shades of black: There have been days where it’s been so dark I could not see my hands in front of me. There have also been days where the sun miraculously appeared and my life stretched out as infinitely as I had once believed it was. Now, I realise, this is what life has always been. Life pre-cancer had always been an anxiety ridden race to some unknown finish line. I always thought ‘ if I graduate from university I will be happy’ or ‘if I lose a little bit of weight I will be happy ’ or ‘i f I find a boyfriend who doesn’t treat me the way his resentful father treats him I will be happy ’ … but I’ve learned it simply does not work like that. I know it does not because I have attained the golden ticket that one is only blessed with when their life flashes in front of their eyes; the realisation that life will never be the perfect dream we’ve dreamt, nor will it be a freakish nightmare. Life to me is an accumulation of struggles and the make or break of the overall verdict in your experience resides in exactly what you want to focus on. A cancer diagnosis will change your life, no matter what way you look at it. If you are lucky enough to be considered ‘curable’ you realise that there must be a life after all this suffering. After the chemotherapy and the scans and the pain and the worry, you must pick up your life where you left off. You must move on. You cannot become a professional patient. But how can you do that when all your world has become is thoughts of the after world? How can you do that when you wrote letters to your friends in case of your death, to tell them just how much you loved them? When you lay all alone in a hospital bed, thinking you were about to die and all you could feel was a delicious relief? The truth is I don’t know yet. I know I have experienced hurt but I have also gained this divine euphoria that I had never felt in life before. Life has become totally and utterly intoxicating. Even as I sit typing this I’ve been stopping to look up from my laptop to just breathe. Very cliche, I know. This kind of euphoria can’t be passed on or traded. I’m not even sure if people who haven’t felt the dark can know truly what this feeling is. I hope maybe this is something my fellow cancer patients can relate to. I hadn’t thought of death until I had to. I hadn’t contemplated death until it stood in front of me and asked me to describe it. I hadn’t smelled death until it wafted through my pores, my body pumping out toxins as it tried to sweat out my cancer. I hadn’t thought about death, but I also hadn’t thought about just how fucking beautiful life was. As Eckhart Tolle has put it: The secret of life is to “die before you die” — and find that there is no death.",tumblr

I was TERRIFIED. I had never had a dick that big and how the fuck did he think it was gonna fit! Heads up…it didn’t. Ya girl got torn. It was bad. There was so much blood it looked like a fucking murder scene. I expected fuckin Criminal Minds or CSI to bust in any minute and start looking for a dead body. It was so bad ol Dick stopped and asked if I was okay. I. Was. Not. I have never left a place so quick. I left $40 on the dresser for new sheets and fucking booked it out that bitch. On my way home I pulled over and furiously googled “torn vagina from big ol dick” to see how long I had left to live. I wasn’t ready to die. I didn’t even have a fucking will (still don’t. The great and wonderful google told me it was normal and should stop in a few hours/days. It didn’t. The bleeding got less and less but was still there. Out of fear for my pussy, I scheduled a GYNO appt and hoped they wouldn’t have to stitch my kitty. The doc takes one look and said “Okay, so Madonna, if you don’t use it then you lose it. She tightened up from not getting laid. Next time you want to like a virgin, use lube” Those are exact words. They are burned into my brain. God bless that doctor. She’s hella chill. She also told me “there’s not a damn thing wrong with getting some strange and hooking up with weirdos from the internet but make sure to use protection. Those same weirdos that give good dick can also give bad STDs” During the exam, she did notice (or feel? Idk) something off so she scheduled an ultrasound the following week. An intravagainal ultrasound. So there I was, getting this wand shoved up and wiggled around in my poor, abused kitty. A mass was found. The doctor scheduled a biopsy 2 weeks later. Fun fact, uterine biopsy’s fucking hurt. You get zero meds, just a tube shoved through the hole in your cervix, a grippy tool put in the tube and a small chunk of your uterus lining ripped the fuck out. I almost kicked my doc in the face. The results came back a few weeks later. It was a precancerous mass. A D&C was scheduled. The results from that showed more precancerous cells than previously thought. A hysterectomy was done June . The after surgery pathology found stage 1 uterine cancer. I’m considered in remission & see a cancer doc every 3 months to make sure it hasn’t come back. That’s how a big dick saved my life. I haven’t had sex since then. Mark me down as scared and not horny when it comes to dick. Even fake dick. 😂",tumblr
non-terminal,"Hello Gamers. Hello Gamers. It has occurred to me five seconds ago that I should probably tell you all an interesting and riveting story that is currently happening to me. So here we go. Trailer: This is health related. I will be fine dw lol ) So on the 30th of March this year (a wednesday, I woke up to a blind spot in my left eye. It was like this little semicircle of despair right about the centre of my vision. I figured that it would probably just go away on its own, so I didn’t worry about it too much and went to class that day. Fast forward to Friday and it was still there being an annoying little shit. It was at this moment that I was like “hey I should get this checked out probably” Lucky for me, I had a very convenient pre-scheduled optometry appointment the next day. So I go to this appointment and am offered this optional test for $25 Canadian dollars and because that is the only cost for the appointment today (subtle brag) I go yes please. It’s that fancy one where they take pictures of the back of your eye. How neat. That happens and I go into the actual exam bit with the optometrist, tell him about my eye, and then he sits down to look at my pictures. They are funky. So he tells me that I have two swollen optic nerves and additional swelling in the adjacent vasculature. There’s also this weird other swelling stuff that’s going on that he can’t explain. It turns out that the fuzzy spot was caused by a pre-retinal hemorrhage, so basically there is blood in my eye and that is not poggers. He thinks I might have high blood pressure, but the additional and weird swelling confuses him, so he sends me to the emergency room of a hospital across town to have some tests run. So much for the rest of my Saturday. So I go to the hospital and get a CT scan and some more eye pictures and meet with some specialists and a bunch of other little tests (like a colourblind one for some reason, and they send me on my merry way. The CT scan didn’t show anything, so that was pretty neat, but they kind of ruled out high blood pressure, which meant more tests. I would like to note that I paid no money for this (brag ) Sunday April 3rd - I go for blood tests at this other place, again free. They took 12 vials of blood. Had to piss in a cup. Was wack. Monday April 4th - I have like a 7:30am appointment (ew so early gross) with an eye specialist. I repeat some of the tests that happened on saturday, and then they sit me down for this dye test where they inject me with a yellow dye so they can see how the blood is flowing in my eyes and then take a whole bunch of pictures. The first one failed which was a wee bit painful but on the upside my piss looked like a blended up minion for the next couple days. Very surreal. After that test I finally got to meet with the specialist in this nice little corner office. He was really nice, told me that the hemorrhage would probably get reabsorbed so I didn’t need to worry about that (it’s gotten a lot better now actually which is nice, still a little bit there though. He then went through the blood flow pictures and couldn’t find anything funky there. And then he brought up my blood tests. This is where things become a lot less cool. Cringe, even. Basically, he tells me that my white blood cell count is incredibly high. Like super duper high. He tells me that the regular count is supposed to be like 20 and mine is at nearly . And this is a symptom that coincides with leukemia. Shit. Let me tell you, that day was not poggers. Nothing is confirmed yet though, so I go home and proceed to have a very unexpected day. I message all my profs and was like “hey, might die, please give me extensions thanks ” (and then I got them. I got a call from a hematologist later that day to go over the testing plan going forward. It included things that sounded not so fun. The next day was my birthday. | Turned 19 though that was neat. Before I go on, I would like to mention that the very first thought I had when that eye specialist told me it could be leukemia was “I’m going to need so many bald jokes” Because you know. Chemotherapy. Wednesday April 6th - I go back to the emergency room. This time I go to a different place, where I get my very own hospital bed (in the corner :D. The game plan is simple. In no particular order: 1) get an MRI 2) get a bone marrow biopsy 3) get more blood tests and 4) get a blood transfusion. What actually happened: 1) super quick blood tests, less blood this time, neat. 2) bone marrow biopsy (fuck that shit was so weird it wasn’t painful because of the freezing stuff but hguieanbcbneuia did not like, would not recommend) 3) MRI could take a few days to be scheduled and they don’t want to keep me overnight 4) ultrasound to look at my spleen and liver 5) no blood transfusion because apparently my hemoglobin count went up since last blood tests so hell yeah 6) I went home What I learned that day: 1) i hate bone marrow biopsies they suck donkey balls 2) my spleen was twice the size it should be (25cm instead of 12cm) 3) I now need to go for blood tests twice a week I got to sleep the next day. Liked that part. I don’t remember when I got the next phone call from the hematologist (she’s been fantastic btw I would definitely recommend her, very helpful and great with explaining things to stupid little me) but it was sub-pog. Basically, I was officially diagnosed with CML (chronic myeloid leukemia. It’s pretty rare in people my age, and makes up for about 15% of total leukemia patients iirc. It’s caused by a freak mutation in your chromosomes, and has three stages: chronic, accelerated, and blast. I got caught in the chronic stage, which is the super treatable one and where most people are diagnosed. I don’t have to go for immediate chemotherapy, and if I’m lucky I shouldn’t need it at all (rip bald jokes L. It’s treated with these fancy little pills, and there are like five or six varieties for me to try which is neat. I should start those soon. Right now I am on two other drugs, though. The first one is called hydroxyurea, and it’s designed to bring down my white blood cell count. I think I peaked at by whatever measurement they had, but it was down to like on April 21st, so that’s some neat little progress right there. I’ll probably have my dose doubled soon to get that count to come down super fast, but for now I’m still too white for my own good. The second drug is called Allopurinol, and it’s designed to preserve my kidneys, because the first drug could make things toxic down there and I would like to keep those body parts thank you very much. Everything is going swimmingly so far though so that’s good. I need to drink like 2 and a half litres of liquid daily though so my toilet is very busy rn. I have to take these drugs at 9:30am every morning which sucks though I just want to sleep in / I think that’s everything. And that’s the story of how got a new zodiac sign ) If you have any questions or good jokes please let me know I will respond to them ) Please don’t pity me though you would not believe how much of that I have gotten in the last couple weeks it is frying my mind I just want to make fun of myself. TL;DR got cancer, fucking L on my part, very treatable, taking many drugs )",tumblr
non-terminal,"8 IV chemo treatments, 2 weeks apart 8 IV chemo treatments, 2 weeks apart I started going for IV treatments at the end of January. Every other Wednesday. They told me to plan to be there about 3, 3 and a half hours. Covid was peaking again. I didn’t want my parents, family, or friends putting themselves at risk to come in and sit with me, so I went each time alone. I brought books, my laptop, magazines… Yet most of the time I slept as the chemicals dripped into my body, a gray and yellow shower curtain drawn in a semi-circle around my chair against the windows. When the drips finished, Meg came over with another box of chemicals. She’d pull on a paper johnny, and double up on gloves before preparing the portable pump I’d be wearing for the next couple of days. Once the pump was attached, a new, steady flow of drugs began. These chemo drugs burned my hands, peeling my skin painfully over time. On Fridays, I’d return to the cancer center so they could disconnect the pump. It felt great to not be tethered to it anymore. Then the fatigue set in. Nausea. Inability to tolerate anything cold. Food and drinks didn’t taste right–metallic or like nothing at all. By the time I got to my 8th chemo treatment, I looked like ass. Beat up. Exhausted. I hear people say I’m brave. Strong. What choice did I have? Stage 3 rectal cancer. I suppose I could’ve chosen not to do chemo. Personally, I think that would’ve been a dumbass choice. I’m not done here. I chose to fight through. I’m not through yet.",tumblr

non-terminal,"Cancer Patients and Oncologists Faced Exceptional Challenges During Pandemic MedicalResearch.com Interview with: Katherine Garcia MD NYU Langone Health MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: Studies on cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown a decrease in new diagnoses, delays in care, and a shift to later stage disease presentations. Considering that NY has been an epicenter for COVID-19 in the U.S, we investigated its impact on new cancer diagnoses at the two campuses of NYU’s Perlmutter Cancer Center and hypothesized that there would be a decrease in presentations during the peak outbreaks in NY. MedicalResearch.com : What are the main findings? - We conducted a single center, retrospective analysis of new cancer diagnoses before, during, and after the peak of the pandemic between Dec 1, , and Aug 31, . - During the initial COVID-19 peak, there was a substantial decrease in new patient visits with statistically significant differences seen by age and certain cancer types including breast, skin, and hematologic malignancies. - In all cancers, there was a decrease in the proportion of new patient visits among those over age 75 during the peak. When confining analyses to breast, skin, and hematologic cancers, we saw a significant increase in the proportion of younger new patients at the peak period. - We also observed an association between age and stage, with an increase in new stage I diagnoses in the younger (age ) population at peak. - Telemedicine was most utilized by the younger population during both peak and recovery periods. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: In this retrospective analysis, we found that during the initial COVID-19 peak, prior to vaccine availability, outpatient visits for hematologic and solid malignancies decreased at our cancer center in NY. The decrease in the proportion of all cancer types in elderly patients during the peak was likely related to hesitancy among this vulnerable population to seek care. The widespread use of telemedicine also likely contributed to the increased incidence in new patient visits in younger patients. MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work? Response: The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has blanketed the health care system. For Medical Oncologists, there have been exceptional challenges to overcome. Lessons learned from this experience can help guide outreach to vulnerable populations during future outbreaks, particularly by fostering telemedicine use among the elderly. I have no relevant conflicts of interest. Citation: ASCO abstract: Consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on new cancer visits to a comprehensive cancer center in New York.

non-terminal,"Soggy From The Chemo (a sick/angstfic) Soggy From The Chemo (a sick/angstfic) TW for cancer descriptions as well as chemo and addiction. I tried my best to depict it as realistically as possible, but lemme know if there’s anything I need to change in the future. I wanted to get a better idea of what I’m going to be putting my boy Elijah through in this novel of his and the start of the fic had been sitting there for a while, so I decided to finish it. I hope you enjoy if you decide to read! An overwhelming sense of heaviness sat unabatingly across Elijah, as he sat half-laying on the leather seat which made up a part of the ring circling the entirety of the sterily formulaic chemo room. It was a feeling he had become accustomed to in the month which had dispersed since his life had ended. To the vision of hourglass grains, it may appear to have been just another gentle upheavel of a day, but to Elijah’s unilateral vision, another reality was conjured. No more was Wednesday merely a day, or a headache merely an inconvenience; now each Wednesday burnt his veins with sickened throes of dread from diagnosis association, and each headache faded blindly into the next, and left him in a constant state of turbulent vibration and bone nausea. Eating was a chore, sleeping was a dream, and living had effectively halted. He had tried to continue working, but all he was able to manage was three days a week on a really good week, so that left leagues of time spent of him wasting away in his flat, trying desperately to maintain some sense of normality. This came in the form of him throwing himself into his painting and drawing, anything to keep his brain off of the topic of itself, of the cancer which festered within itself. He had stage 3 small-cell carcinoma with brain mets. The newly formed brain tumour which had incited the need for a diagnosis had only been an extant result of a bigger problem he had never paid attention to while it had slowly developed within him. It was one of the biggest cancer killers for veterans, and it looked like it had gotten ahold of yet another. Who even knew how much dirt, shrapnel, chemicals, bone-fragments and active war-zone inhalants he had drawn into his lungs during his deployments, or how many cigarettes he had smoked through to keep his hands from shaking from the memory of it? He always chalked every one of his early symptoms to the smoking, it made sense for his chest to hurt and for him to be set off coughing at random, right? For his lungs to produce acidic rust and for him to have to sometimes fight for breath? Surely, he was just losing weight due to the stress and the trauma. Like the fucking idiot he was, he had ignored everything until his condition had advanced to the point it had metastasised elsewhere so that he could no longer ignore it. It demanded his undivided attention, and boy fucking shit did it have it now. A constant physical sense of dread weighed down upon him now, never having let up since first hearing Michelle gasp out that word through her tears, and certainly remaining steadfast atop him now, as the amber chemo syrup slowly dripped into his veins from the IV in the top of his hand, knowing deep in his aching bones that he would be completely laid low once he got home that night, as if he ever wasn’t low these days. Perhaps he had thought that each infusion would become easier because he would have a better idea of what to expect each time, but that had turned out to be a total sham – every single session he was left feeling worse than the last, and could expect to be glued to the couch, his bed, or the bathroom floor for at least the first four days afterwards. He had begrudgingly taken up knitting to craft himself some personalised beanies to hide his barely peach fuzz-covered head, and his mouth was a constant bleeding mess of sores he still couldn’t work out how to combat. His complexion had seemed to permanently lighten from the gorgeous deep brown it usually was, perpetually washed out in appearance with a face once nicely toned left puffy and swollen. Everything he tried to put in his mouth was coppery in taste and never wanted to stay. His clothes, which were now practically always heavy and wintery-intended, constantly became heavier and grossly damp from the treatment-induced sweats, and he trembled with a fever he could never seem to break. His chest and head constantly hurt to the point of tears and sometimes blacking out, and he had a total of six more grand-mal seizures since his first. His mind seemed to have come to a complete stand-still, so foggy he could barely speak at times, and when he did it sounded as if his voice was totally alien to him, as if someone else entirely was steering his ship. They hadn’t passed their aptitude test, however, and they steered him into walls and sent him to the ground it seemed every time he tried to walk, to the point Michelle, who had become his biggest support system and makeshift caretaker, had suggested they look into a wheelchair for him. This wasn’t a big deal for her, she already used one spasmodically for her MS when it got particularly burdensome, but Elijah was extremely unimpressed with that idea – he hadn’t even needed one when he had returned home disfigured from war, why would he suddenly start using one now? That was an ongoing fight between them, but aside from that Michelle was entirely in his corner, taking him to appointments, getting his groceries, caring for him where no one else could. He knew his family so wanted to be with him in this, but by this point they had scattered, all the children now independent, and many had ended up returning to Italy. Two of his siblings, Bella and Mattia, still remained in the country, but they were nowhere near him, it would be an insurmountable task trying to get to him, and it wasn’t something he could expect them to do. He didn’t have any friends outside of work he could actually trust. Michelle really was the only one he had, and he couldn’t be more grateful for that. He nervously sucked on what was so lovingly called a ‘cancer pop, a warm-tasting turmeric and cinnamon popsicle he was always given every infusion, and despite it hitting his stomach awkwardly and making it twist in protest, it was like practical heaven on his sore-infested mouth. He had managed to down a warm, almost sickeningly sweet tea and a few digestives since sitting down, as the staff insisted he eat as much as he could during the sessions (probably due in part to the fact they knew he found it so hard to do so while at home, and while the actual chemo hadn’t started making him feel sick just yet, you weren’t exactly given a lot of time to recover between infusions – he was still fighting off the last dose. Plus every time he didn’t spit out the bloody mucous he produced regardless of whether he had been coughing or not, it just got swallowed and went straight to his stomach. Swallowing a concoction like that would make anyone green around the gills, not to even mention he did it multiple times a day. As he ate his popsicle he found he stopped breathing while performing the sucking motion, and thus when he would eventually stop and swallow what he had worked off the stick he would have to fight to regain some of the oxygen he had missed, which with his cancer-riddled lungs was an extremely hard undertaking. He got out of breath so easily, merely sitting still and not moving at all, just doing nothing but breathing, he would get winded, tiring out just by the mere effort of pulling air in and pushing it back out. They were currently in the middle of assessing whether he needed supplementary oxygen, but apparently he didn’t quite meet the threshold just yet. Elijah couldn’t help but be stuck on the distinction, yet . How encouraging. You’re fine for now . But how long would that last? He had unknowingly left his cancer simmering within him for quite some time, what seemed like a drastic and rapid outcome had in actuality been a long time coming. He hadn’t just woken up one day with stage 3 cancer – it had once been a vague tickle in his chest, probably a year ago, where he had just chalked it up to smoking a bit too much. Well, he hadn’t technically been wrong. Because this wasn’t the paediatric oncology unit and he and Michelle weren’t married or in that kind of relationship, it was encouraged that she didn’t accompany him to the sessions, where he and everyone else there were severely immunocompromised and were already putting themselves at risk just by being there to get their medicine. Michelle entering the hospital unnecessarily would up the risk of either carrying or coming down with all the various illnesses they generally tried to keep away from the cancer patients, which would in turn put Elijah at great risk of getting sick, and with his lungs was a very dangerous situation. Thankfully thus far they had been successful in keeping from infecting him, but that wasn’t due to luck – he and Michelle barely took off their face masks, and everything in his flat had been disinfected and re-disinfected again. They were putting their all in keeping him as healthy as they possibly could, and that included him being alone through these awful sessions. He always left with a little less of himself, a part he knew he would be slow at regaining, if he ever did manage to. Another part Michelle would never get to see again. If he got through this and went into remission, which was admittedly a far-cry when he had only started receiving treatment when it had already metastasised, he wouldn’t come out of it whole. He could almost feel the holes this poison drug burned through his veins right to his skin. He returned from war, only to walk himself right into another one that only he was a member in. There would be no Reggie’s or battle mates, or even Iraqi girls to carry him to safety now. He started this new war, and he was the only one who was able to fight it. Although, he guessed he had a new battle mate. Too bad she had to wait in the car. * “Hey, Eli, tried to keep the car warm for when you got out. How you doin, can I get you anything” Her reassuring voice was a blessed anchor he could grab onto as he stumbled in a miserable haze from the sliding doors and fell into the passenger seat of his car. He always left these sessions hollowed-out, nothing behind his tired eyes except exhaustion and utter emptiness. As he sat panting damply, hand resting on his heaving chest, he fought not to be swept beneath the waves he constantly struggled against, because Michelle didn’t deserve that. He was already at the mercy of his brain tumour to lash out, still struggling to keep some of the Elijah he loved so dearly around. Where would he be to accept all this help from her, when she didn’t need to be doing anything for him, just then to verbally abuse her and curse her out for only trying to help. But it was so fucking hard, these weren’t conscious decisions he was making to act out, given literally any other alternative he would take it in a heartbeat. So, unable to look up into the pure expression of concern he just knew would be drawn across her face, he swallowed thickly, tasting blood, and murmured, “Thanks, it was fine, I just really want to go home now. I want Private” Private was his blond fox terrier, and without fail he would lay either in his lap or beside him, or at his feet, every single time he came back from chemo, and just that tiny gesture meant the world to him, always at least got him a little bit emotional, which frankly wasn’t hard these days. All he wanted right then was his couch and his baby, Private just seemed to have that ability to warm him when nothing else could, in more ways than just one, and he definitely wanted to get in some much-needed cuddle time before the chemo would catch up with him. At least give him a few minutes. * After a brief shower in which he just stood beneath the water unmoving, he immediately changed into his comfy pyjamas and a huge hoodie along with a few (dozen) blankets and parked himself on the couch, and much to his joy Private wandered over to him and jumped up beside him, heading for his lap as if on autopilot. He laid down beside him with his head and front feet draped across his lap, and Elijah’s hollow heart swelled oh so subtly, working his real and prosthetic fingers over his almost cotton-y fur, smiling for the first time that day as he murmured, “Hey boy, you keeping daddy company” ”Of course, why wouldn’t he want to” Michelle giggled as she walked around the couch to set the bucket which had been appointed specifically to after chemo and nothing else by his feet, the plastic liner within it rustling with each movement. She also placed down his freshly-filled Glospee water bottle, the ice within rattling most satisfyingly, a glass of also iced ginger ale, and his webster pack. “I’ll start making dinner when I’m finished up here, but can I get you anything before I do? Your sketch book or your switch” Elijah still couldn’t handle the look he could hear in her voice, so didn’t meet her gaze when he requested, “Probably just the remote today, I am” he paused to catch his breath and rub at his face, “so, so very tired tonight” Michelle smiled sadly down at her very best friend. What she wouldn’t give to be able to cure him, she so deeply ached to see that old smile of his back on his face, one which told absolutely no tales of what he had seen in life. She hadn’t seen it in so long, even before he had been diagnosed, because the old him had already been in the process of being sapped. Why had this beautiful man had to have been the one to be laid low by his own body like this? Why hadn’t it been her? Why were her own symptoms beginning to go into remission when no one was sure if Elijah would ever have that chance? If she kept standing there she may just speak that sentiment aloud, which wasn’t something Elijah necessarily needed to hear, not at least when he was meant to be resting. She reached down for the remote on the coffee table and handed it off to him, her hand lingering on his as she felt her eyes growing warm, a painful mass forming in her throat. It just wasn’t fair… * It really wasn’t fair. Elijah had eventually turned the tv on to Netflix and had been getting lost in The Haunting of Hill House while Michelle cooked in the background, but gradually he was losing the ability to concentrate on it, and all his focus was instead on how cold he was. Even with all the layers he currently had on, it was doing nothing to gift him any warmth, and he was left violently shivering while pulling all the blankets around him as tightly as he could manage, Private eventually moving himself to be sitting fully in his lap and stretching his head and front feet up to rest on his stomach up to his chest, essentially hugging his person. Elijah would be totally remiss not to hug him back, and making sure the blankets were still covering every possible inch of him, he wrapped his arms around his fuzzy body, nuzzling his face against his baby’s. He made sure to try and keep his teeth from chattering while he was so close to Private’s mouth, he couldn’t risk being licked anywhere near it. He knew then, logically, that he shouldn’t be allowing him to be so close to him, but cuddling with Private was some of the only physical contact he made, Michelle refused to risk it where possible, so he was totally touch-starved, not to mention that his puppy was like a walking heated blanket, how could he possibly keep him away when he was sometimes the only form of warmth he was able to experience? He begrudgingly ate the chicken noodle soup Michelle had made, her go-to the first dinner after chemo, grimacing at the thick taste of metal cloying the experience and at the warm food touching the sores in his mouth. Michelle sat in the armchair across from him silently eating her soup, mostly watching her friend struggle with his own. She was proud of him for trying to eat; he still tried, regardless of how much it would soon bite him in the arse. It always did, like clockwork, and yet he gave it a go, every time. She hoped his tv show would be a distraction to him when it eventually did go south. Until then she would watch him, and make silent plans to race for the heavy-duty gloves as soon as she was needed to intervene. * At least two hours later Elijah had decided he was too tired to remain sitting up, and changed tactics to be curled up in a tight cocoon of blankets, his head resting on a pillow which was wedged between him and Private’s back. Michelle had turned the heating up until she was almost dripping with sweat when he had asked her to, but still, somehow, he was shivering like his life depended on it. He kind of wished he had gone into this as a more overweight person, because at least when he would start unintentionally losing weight he would have a longer time to go before he was skin and bone. He wasn’t entirely there yet, but he was by this point far thinner than he had ever been, and just on that front alone he had next to no heat reserves. This utter cold, however, did nothing whatsoever to combat the sweat which soon became forming. It seemed to take absolutely no time after its inception that he was thoroughly drenched. Every single article of clothing he had on was at least damp, and still more dripped from every inch of his almost hairless body, finding no pause between that and the shivering which found a similar amount. He absolutely hated this part, it was almost as if he had developed a new layer to his skin made entirely of slippery humidity, and it always left him totally disgusted. No matter of drying off or showering or fucking anything slowed it down, and all it did was cool him down more. He was so freezing. He clutched himself beneath the blankets, his hands slipping on his exposed skin, and moaned. He knew what the next step was. And soon it rushed in, seemingly free-falling into him. Nausea swelled in the pit of his stomach, tightening his upper torso and worsening his trembling. This nausea burned his essentially traumatised stomach lining, the contents within seeming to churn in a circular motion, like an overfull blender, while he himself was trapped in a washing machine. He was becoming dizzy and the familiar taste of metal was blooming across the back of his quivering tongue, two more signs he was going to throw up, and soon. It didn’t necessarily scare him, but he knew how much it hurt every time, and how out of breath it left him. It was such an uncomfortable process, and one that wasn’t relieved with its fruition – he would left at the mercy of that process for days to come, more often than not over a week. He was nauseous and vomiting more often than he wasn’t these days, he was admittedly used to it by now, but that didn’t make him any more thrilled about it. He tried to swallow it down and ignore it, laser-focussing on the current episode he was on, but even though he had rewatched this show hundreds of times, he couldn’t work out what was happening, as if this was his first viewing. He hadn’t really even broken his attention from it, but that didn’t matter to his foggy, knackered brain; it was as if he hadn’t been paying attention at all, and trying to now was just tiring him out more than he already was. But anything, anything not to focus on the god-awful feeling in his belly. But it wasn’t exactly something he could just will away, his reaction to the medicine and to the disease itself wasn’t exactly in his control, and soon enough he felt so sick that it hurt to breathe, and he knew he should start the process of sitting up to grab his bucket (it wasn’t safe for Michelle to come into direct contact with his bodily fluids so the moment he began feeling the possibility of vomiting it was just safest to either grab his bucket or run to the toilet. When Elijah began sitting himself up, Michelle knew exactly what he was after, could already see the nausea in his face. She quickly got to her feet and crossed over to him, grabbing up his bucket and plunking it into his lap before sprinting from the room to get her gloves. Elijah was gagging almost as soon as he was upright, clutching to the rim with both hands in a white-knuckled grip, while his stomach visibly pulled inward. H retched desperately, panting just before his ab muscles squeezed hard and a flood of his dinner drained from his mouth and nose, splattering noisily into the plastic liner. “Huh, you actually kept that down longer than I thought you would, Eli, congrats” Michelle half-heartedly joked as she re-entered the room and sat down beside him, rubbing his soggy back as he gutturally gagged, a gurgling growl preceding another thick dousing of dark orange vomit to burst hard from his mouth, leading him to pretty much shove his entire head into the bucket to keep the possibility of a mess to the absolute minimum. The explicit sting present in an inordinate number of points in his mouth was made even more obvious when the next time he threw up, blood from his oral sores mixed with the acidic sick to colour the already off-putting orange into a downright panicky red. If it weren’t for its blatant reason, he was sure Michelle would have had him in the emergency department in a heartbeat. If he weren’t mistaken, he was sure she would already be thinking about it regardless, further evidenced by the subtle tightening in the muscles of her hand he was trying to focus on present on his back. Between the ice in his bones, the fire in his mouth, the tight nausea swirling in his belly, the clammy spinning in his head, how much it hurt to breathe, and how badly his body craved to be unconscious, it was all just too much for him. None of this was fair, why the fuck hadn’t he just died in combat instead of coming back disabled at the mercy of his body eventually killing him anyway? He had fought so hard to stay alive, for what? Just so his own body could kill him later and far slower? What had it all been for when his own worst enemy was himself? What hadn’t killed him certainly hadn’t made him stronger. Why had he done this to himself? From deep in his battered chest he sobbed, hot tears flooding his eyes, just in time to choke up more seemingly pure acid. The effort of forcing it up and then feeling it on his wounds was an agony he wouldn’t wish on anyone, and one he wished he coud be far away from. He begged his body to cease, please, he just wanted to sleep, but it took many more mouthfuls of vomit to be expelled for him to get a break, finally coming to a stop in a totally breathless state, fighting for air and sobbing raggedly. He knew he should try and calm himself down so he could better catch his breath, but that didn’t mean he knew how. He was in such an acute state of misery, he wished he could be hugged but that wouldn’t be safe. That was why he couldn’t even have an ungloved hand rubbing his back. Why couldn’t he just be normally sick, where sure you didn’t necessarily want to pass it on, but it wasn’t as if your bodily fluids were essentially corrosive in that situation. He could be held without discretion with bare hands, not instead handled like some sick animal. Michelle may as well be wearing a hazmat suit to Elijah’s skewed perception, and there was something really dehumanizing about that which burned him down to his very soul. He knew these precautions she had to take were only for a few days after each infusion, but that still didn’t mean it didn’t somewhat hurt – that was when he needed her the most! * He had been quick to accept Michelle’s offer to be taken to bed after he finally stopped vomiting for the time being, but had had to be half-dragged half-carried to his bedroom from how absolutely drained of energy he was, sagging heavily on her shoulder while she led him slowly down the hall and to his bed, which he practically fell into. In the time he had been up and walking the temperature had seemed to lower still, and by the time he got to his bed he was seeing double from the shivering, his teeth surely going to break from chattering so hard. He miserably crawled under his blankets and removed his prosthetics while Michelle rushed to grab the rest that were still on the couch, laying them down across his trembling form. He felt so incredibly awful, folding his hands over his still loudly churning belly and groaning. He was getting a headache. A disgusted shudder ran down his spine, curling up on his side and whimpering, trying not to start crying all over again. God, please just let him sleep, he was begging now. It wasn’t fair. Michelle brought through the freshly scrubbed and lined bucket and sat it on the floor beside his bed, resting his water bottle on the beside table which was cluttered with various pill bottles and boxes. “There we go, sweetheart, I’ve let Renee know I’ll be staying over, again, so I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. Just try and get some rest now, you so dearly need it” she said softly, so wanting to run her fingers through his hair, curl up beside him and hold him until he fell asleep, but not wanting to risk hurting herself. If she were also being honest with herself, she was stressed, for obvious reasons, and desperately wanted a cigarette. She had continued smoking them back at home so to keep it away from him as best she could, but she really desperately wanted one right then, broaching more into the realm of needing it. But where would she be, smoking while looking after her friend with lung cancer? This was an internal fight she was steadily losing at, however, and she was already in the process of figuring out where she would sneak to after he was asleep to get her hit. How could she be so weak? How could she do this to him, and to herself? If not the entire reason Elijah had gotten sick it was at least a high contributor, so why couldn’t she give them up knowing this was an option for her fate to lead her towards? Well, they were both addicts. Addiction kind of has a habit of overpowering every morality you have to see itself fed. She truly didn’t want to hurt Elijah. She was just too weak to not. * ’Chelle” “Yeah, Eli” “Please stop smoking” “Okay, sweetheart” Michelle ran this exchange over and over in her mind as she sat huddled in her car, lighting a cigarette in her clasped hands before inhaling and blowing out its toxic cloud. This had been the last thing he had said before falling asleep, and not even five minutes later here she was, having actively lied to him and doing exactly what he had asked she stop. Tears ran down her cheeks as she sucked on the filled paper, holding it in her mouth before letting it billow out as she sobbed on the exhale, hiding her burning face in shame. What the fuck was she doing? How could this stupid little thing have such a hook on her, when she was actively being shown what could happen to her down the track? She was betraying him, truly she was, and betraying anyone else in their situation, and betraying herself. He had asked her to stop, and she couldn’t. She wanted to grind the cigarette under her foot, stub it out and be done with it, but the thought made her so nauseous that she had to hurriedly take another drag to calm herself down. Quitting was not a likely outcome at any point in her future. “I’m so fucking sorry, Elijah” she moaned in inner turmoil, as she tremulously inhaled pure cancer directly into her lungs, blowing it out in another, even louder sob. She’d need another cigarette to calm this crying down.",tumblr
non-terminal,"good morning, coffee talk. good morning, coffee talk… I tire greatly of updating when I feel terrible and don’t rise from my bed all day or like this time haven’t eaten in 3 days. its cancer, i got it and i live and fight it daily. so if i am gone for a while you will know what it is. trust me if im hospitalized again I will post, its in my nature and some kind of coping mechanism for me. as if in a dungeon i would post every day a mark on the wall to count the days before release or death. im determined to survive this but in all reality one must make the plans and tidy ones life. those two can exist at the same time. I just don’t want to announce them. it makes the people around me nervous and it makes my page morose, which is the opposite of what I want. on that note if you want advice or someone to talk to im right here. how to deal with diagnosis or port installation or navigating the medical industry? I can’t promise I have the best answers but I will say that right from the diagnosis you are a cancer survivor. that’s where your battle starts and that’s the best thing to realize when it starts. don’t lie down and resign yourself to instant defeat. I saw some of those in the hospital when I lost my stomach. get up. life is there and your first step is choosing it. I like to draw so I draw. I like to garden so I garden. I like to read so I read. I like many things, and I get up to do them even if I am pulling myself out of a pit of despair. I’ve said before, I would like it said, I was courageous and optimistic to the bitter end. the less I dwell on death at the door the less chance it has to put its misery spell on me. Im going to live until it is wrestled from my hands, and that’s not today and its not tomorrow and its a long way off. the pain and suffering is very real but that’s life hurting, not death. resolve to overcome it. mindset is everything. it makes more difference than the overall medical consensus will admit, but every oncologist I have spoken to agrees. even the guy who cut my stomach out. so my biggest advice? get up. decide to live. so happy tuesday. onward we go. take your meds. eat something. drink the coffee. do the things.",tumblr

I’m just not interested in a format I don’t play much or reprints that aren’t important to the format(s) I do play. So, I’ve just been playing Explorer over on Arena since New Capenna came out. However, other things have also been interrupting online life. My best friend just this week has learned he has Stage 3 esophageal cancer and I have been his driver to his appointments since the discovery. He’s been showing signs of this form of cancer for awhile, at times, early satiety when eating, at other times, loss of appetite. He’s 67 and has other health problems. Either I or one of his kids will be with him at each appointment. There’s no treatment plan yet as they’re still working on a full diagnosis and whether or not the cancer will spread. He has more lab tests and appointments in the coming weeks.

So I haven’t really talked about my cancer diagnosis yet here. This is probably gonna be rambly because I’m still processing a lot. It’s only been like a week, but time is meaningless now. Anyway, yea, like a week ago I got the confirmed diagnosis that I have thyroid cancer. It’s still pretty small and very treatable, so I’m not terribly worried about it. I’ve kind of been bouncing between numb “this is just one thing too many in the course of three months for me to feel anything” and relief that there’s something Real I can point to when I’m just mysteriously affflicted with malaise. Like. Ohhh I’m not lazy and unmotivated I HAVE FUCKING CANCER. Like seriously, this is such a relief in its way. I called in sick to work two days this week (and wasn’t feeling great the rest of the week either) and for once I felt no guilt and self-loathing over it because I had a good reason . It may sound a little fucked up, but I’ve honestly been wishing to have something like this for years. Just. A desire to be truly sick instead of just feeling randomly and invisibly like shit. Like I have no physical symptoms I could point to like nausea (that one is linked to a different illness, I.e my anxiety) or a sore throat. I’m just exhausted to the point of tears and lack any will to do anything, even get up and pee. And maybe it can’t be entirely attributed to the cancer, because I have no idea how long I’ve had it. And I have other things, invisible disabilities that also explain my issues. But. Nobody can argue with cancer. Like, even my asshole brain can’t be like “ok but maybe you’re just faking” because I saw the tumor on the screen! I know it’s there! Anyway, everyone is very worried and concerned and asking how I’m doing and I’m like “GREAT! THIS IS GREAT NEWS” But it’s hard to understand that so I’m sticking with “I’m still in shock” for easier understanding. So far my medical team is moving quickly and I think the process of curing it will not be too protracted, but if that changes my viewpoint will probably change too. I want this to be a low-stress diagnosis, and I’m cautiously optimistic it will be. Because I just cannot take one more major stressor.",tumblr

Here’s the good news: I just underwent my final round of testing and as of right now, I am cancer free!

non-terminal,"One out of three are suffering from cancer in USA Know About Cancer 1 in 3 people in the United States have cancer. You or someone you know may have cancer. Here is some information to help you better understand what cancer is. You are made up of trillions of cells that normally grow and divide as needed throughout your life. When cells become abnormal or age, they usually die. Cancer starts when something goes wrong in this process, cells keep making new cells, and old or abnormal cells don’t die when they should. You may be locked out. This makes it difficult for the body to do its job. Cancer is successfully treated in many people. In fact, more people than ever before are living full lives after cancer treatment. Cancer is not just a disease There are many different types of cancer. Cancer can occur anywhere in the body and is named after the part of the body where it occurs. For example, breast cancer that starts in the breast is called breast cancer even if it has spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body. Mainly he has two categories of cancer. Blood cancers are cancers of blood cells such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Solid tumor The most common solid tumors are breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer. Although these cancers are similar in some ways, they may differ in how they grow, metastasize, and respond to treatment. Some cancers grow and spread rapidly. Others grow more slowly. Some are more likely to spread to other parts of the body. Others tend to stay in the first place. Some cancers are best treated with surgery. Others respond well to drugs such as chemotherapy. Often he will have two or more treatments for best results. What is a tumor? A tumor is a lump or growth. Some lumps are cancerous, but many are not. Lumps that are not cancer are called benign. Of the nodules, those that are cancerous are called malignant. Cancer cells may slough off where the cancer started. These cells can travel to other parts of the body and eventually end up in lymph nodes and other body organs, causing problems with normal function. What causes cancer? Cancer cells arise from multiple changes in genes. These changes can have many causes Lifestyle habits, genes inherited from parents, and exposure to environmental carcinogens can all play a role. Often there is no clear cause. What stage is the cancer? Once cancer is found, tests will be done to find out how big it is and whether it has spread from where it started. This is called the cancer stage. A stage lower than (such as stage 1 or 2) means the cancer has not spread much. A higher number (such as level 3 or 4) means more spread. Level 4 is the highest level. The stage of cancer is very important in choosing the best treatment for the person. Ask your doctor about your cancer stage and what it means for you. How does cancer spread? Cancer can spread from where it started (the primary site) to other parts of the body. Once cancer cells separate from a tumor, they can travel to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Cancer cells that travel through the bloodstream can reach distant organs. Cancer cells can travel through the lymph system and eventually reach the lymph nodes. In either case, most escaped cancer cells die or are killed before they can grow elsewhere. But one or two can colonize new areas, start growing, and form new tumors. This spread of cancer to new parts of the body is called metastasis. The cells that form metastases are the same types of cells as the primary cancer. They are not new types of cancer. For example, breast cancer cells that have spread to the lung are still breast cancer, not lung cancer. And colon cancer cells that have metastasized to the liver are still colon cancer. In order for cancer cells to spread to new parts of the body, they must undergo several changes. They must first be able to separate from the original tumor and then adhere to the outer walls of lymphatic or blood vessels. It then has to pass through the walls of blood vessels and travel with blood and lymph to new organs and diseases. Symptoms such as fever and bleeding can be seen and measured by others. Symptoms such as pain and fatigue are felt or noticed by the affected person. The signs and symptoms of cancer depend on where the cancer is, how big it is, and how much it affects nearby organs and tissues. If the cancer has spread (metastasized, it may cause signs and symptoms in different parts of the body. How does cancer cause signs and symptoms? Cancer may begin to grow or invade nearby organs, blood vessels, or nerves. This pressure causes some of the signs and symptoms of cancer. Cancer can also cause symptoms such as fever, extreme fatigue and weight loss This is likely because cancer cells have used up much of the body’s energy supply. Alternatively, cancers can release substances that change the way the body makes energy.Cancers can also trigger reactions in the immune system in ways that produce these signs and symptoms. What are the common signs and symptoms of cancer? Most signs and symptoms are not caused by cancer, but may be caused by other causes. If your signs and symptoms persist or get worse, see your doctor to determine the cause. If cancer is not the cause, doctors can identify the cause and treat it if necessary. For example, lymph nodes are part of the body’s immune system and help trap harmful substances in the body. Normal lymph nodes are small and can be difficult to find. However, if there is infection, inflammation, or cancer, the lump can grow. Those near the surface of the body can be so large that they can be felt with a finger, and some can be seen as swellings or lumps under the skin.One reason lymph nodes can swell is when cancer is trapped in them. is. So if you have an unusual swelling or lump, you should see your doctor to find out what’s going on. The parts are shown below. However, each of these issues can also be caused by other issues. Fatigue or extreme fatigue that does not improve with rest Unexplained weight loss or gain of 10 pounds or more Eating disorders such as hunger, difficulty swallowing, stomach pain, or feeling sick Swelling or lumps anywhere in the body Lumps or lumps in the chest or other parts of the body Pain incurable or yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice, especially new or unexplained, that does not go away or gets worse. Persistent cough or hoarseness Unexplained unusual bleeding or bruising Persistent changes in bowel habits, such as constipation or diarrhea, or changes in the appearance of stool Pain during urination Bladder changes Fever or night sweats Headache Visual or hearing problems Mouth changes such as sores, bleeding, pain or numbness There are many other things not listed here. If you notice significant changes in how you are functioning or feeling, especially if they persist for a long time or get worse, consult your doctor. If it is not cancer related, your doctor can learn more about it and treat it if necessary. In some cases, cancer can be detected before symptoms appear. The American Cancer Society and other health organizations recommend getting cancer-related screenings and certain tests, even if you don’t have symptoms. This helps detect certain types of cancer early. For more information on early detection, see the American Cancer Society’s Guidelines for Early Detection of Cancer. Also, remember that it is important to see your doctor if you have new or worsening signs or symptoms, even if you have had cancer-related screening. Signs and symptoms may indicate cancer or another disease that needs treatment. Imaging tests can be used in many ways, such as looking for cancer, to see how far it has spread, and to determine if cancer treatment is working. Endoscopy Endoscopy is a medical procedure in which a doctor inserts a tubular instrument into the body to look inside. bronchoscopy colonoscopy cystoscopy laparoscopy laryngoscopy mediastinoscopy thoracoscopy Can cancer be cured? Cure for cancer depends on the type and stage of cancer, the type of treatment received, and other factors. Some cancers are easier to cure than others But every cancer needs to be treated differently. There is no cure for cancer. Cure and Remission Cure means that the cancer has gone away with treatment, no further treatment is needed, and the cancer is unlikely to come back. Doctors are rarely confident that the cancer will not come back again. In most cases, it takes time to find out if the cancer is likely to come back. However, the longer the cancer-free period, the more likely the cancer will not come back. When treatment appears to be working, doctors tend to say that the cancer is in remission rather than cured. Remission is the period during which the cancer is responding to treatment or is under control. Some people think that remission means that the cancer is cured, but that may not be the case. In complete remission, all signs and symptoms of cancer disappear and no cancer cells are detected by any test. In a partial response, the cancer shrinks but does not disappear completely. Remission may last from weeks to years. Depending on the type of cancer, treatment may or may not continue during remission. A complete remission can last for years, and over time the cancer can be considered cured. I have What do survival statistics mean? When told they have cancer, many people ask their doctors about their chances of survival. There are many factors in the answer, but there are statistics that help. A statistic is a number that describes what happens to a large group of people with the same diagnosis. Statistics can’t be applied to any particular person, but they can give you an idea of ​what to expect. The statistics used for cancer are: Survival: Percentage of people alive at a specified time after diagnosis. Overall survival: The proportion of people with a given type and stage of cancer who do not die from any cause during the period after diagnosis. Cancer (or disease) specific survival rate: Percentage of people with a particular type and stage of cancer who did not die of the cancer within a specified time period after diagnosis. 5-year relative survival: Percentage of people alive 5 years after diagnosis. It does not include those who died from other diseases. Viability can represent any time period. However, researchers usually look at relative 5-year survival rates. What does it mean to be a cancer survivor? There are multiple definitions of cancer survivor. Some people use the term to refer to someone who has been diagnosed with cancer. This is what the American Cancer Society means when they talk about surviving or living as a cancer survivor. increase Others call a person a survivor only if they live several years after being diagnosed with cancer. However, keep in mind that some people take longer to complete treatment and not everyone completes it. Some people live with cancer as a chronic disease for years. Other affected people, such as family members and friends, may also be considered cancer survivors. Being a cancer survivor means different things to different people. Some patients are cancer-free after treatment, but may experience late and long-term side effects from treatment.Others may be cancer-free after treatment, but their cancer will return. In addition, some people need continued cancer treatment to keep the cancer under control. But anyone diagnosed with cancer needs care that focuses on their individual needs. Not everyone likes to be called a cancer survivor. Everyone has the right to define their cancer experience. Anyone who calls themselves a cancer survivor should be considered one.",tumblr

non-terminal,"The hard part of recovery Is not just recovery, but how other people perceive recovery and remission. When I say, “I am in remission” I do not mean that I am cured. You are not considered cured until there has been no recurrence of ANY cancer ANYWHERE in your body for at least five years. Even then, seven, ten, even twenty years down the road cancer can still occur. Even the drugs and radiation I was given to treat my cancer can cause leukemia or lymphoma, or other cancers. I have to live with that fear, see doctors and have imaging done for the rest of my life. I am in remission, not cured, not even considered to be cancer-free yet - if ever. Recovery is another misconception. Recovery is not a straight line. I was in chemoradiation - constantly and without a break for five weeks. I was allowed time to recover before starting eight treatments of harsher chemo cocktails called FOLFOX. Some side effects of chemo hang on for a year or mor e. With me that includes neuropathy, chemo brain, vision issues, joint/muscle/nerve pain, balance and mobility issues - some are getting better and some are not. Recovery does not mean that I am well, it means that I am recovering from treatment and trauma (believe me, there is a lot of that. I’m in therapy for that trauma and for survivorship. I’m recovering, that’s all. Surgery, imaging, and other procedures are a part of treatment, and I have had in the past year, Colonoscopy 2x MRI 2x CT scan 4x Cystoscopy 4x Nephrostomy 1x Foley catheter 1x Uretal stent placement and removal 3x Shoulder pin, plate and screws 1x X-rays (lost count) Full hysterectomy - ovaries, tubes, uterus, cervix Bladder and uretal resection Colon resection Temporary ileostomy, with upcoming reversal and recovery Labs - lost count Adverse events - reaction to CT scan contrast, reaction to cyclosporin Further, recovering from surgery is like recovering from being hit by a bus. It doesn’t take weeks, it takes months, it takes pain control, it takes an understanding of what I can and can’t do afterward. Hell, it took me six weeks to take a shower standing up and that long to be able to put on socks and shoes. Little victories include going up a ladder and changing a lightbulb, or vacuuming, or learning to do squats again. Further, having an ileostomy is very isolating. You have a bag attached to your body to catch your shit. Why? Because that resection needs to heal. Your diet is restricted, and lots of things can and do go sideways. If you sweat, the adhesive seal will dissolve. It’s hard to stay hydrated. It can get blocked - painful and potentially dangerous. Your skin gets irritated to the point of bleeding and blistering from repeated applications and removal of adhesive. You have to buy ostomy bags, ostomy rings to make sure the bag sticks, periostomy wipes, skin prep wipes, adhesive remover wipes, a special powder for hurting skin, and because you feel less like shit some cute ostomy bag covers. My ostomy bag shorties are pretty cute, too. Honestly, the first time I looked at my stoma I almost threw up and did cry. You can’t just pick up the supplies you need at the local CVS, and ostomy supply companies want a prescription from your doc for each and every little thing. Your insurance may or may not cover the supplies or have a copay. I ended up getting mine from Amazon as it’s cheaper and faster. Anyone who tells you that you should only need to change the ostomy bag every three to five days is a liar. I move, I exercise, I sweat, and that bag does not stay stuck for more than 36 hours. Yes, I had someone chirp at me, “But aren’t you better now” I replied, “The simple answer is yes, in some areas I am.

non-terminal,"Cancer: The Journey Cancer: The Journey First Steps I can’t say anything as brave as ‘battling cancer’ or 'fighting cancer’ I think that the best thing I can say is that I am enduring cancer. Pronounced to be in remission the last week of December, I understand that I am not cured. Instead, I have what I have chosen to call Schrodinger’s Cancer - they don’t know if it’s there or not, but we are choosing to proceed as if it is until blood tests and imaging indicate otherwise. Even after five years, when they pronounce one to be 'cured’ - there is always the chance of recurrence or a new type of cancer altogether. There will always be a sword hanging over my head, as my chemobuddies taught me. I found out about my cancer by reading my discharge papers from a place I will call Asshat Central Hospital. They referred me to Asshat specialists who from my calls in the middle of February could not see me until the end of march, and in some cases as far out as May. I needed to see an oncologist and a urologist urgently. Over the next two weeks, I was stumbling and fumbling as I tried to get care out of my HMO network, two more visits to the ER got me a shot of morphine and a CT scan, another list of referals, and finally pain meds. I woke up on the morning of March 3rd in so much pain that I thought I was going to die. I knew if I went back to Asshat Central, Dunno Medical Center, or Clowncar General that even with my PPO, that I would die. I got my ass in an Uber and over the hill to Cedars-Sinai. I was upstairs and in a bed in a matter of hours, I had painmeds and that first night I remember sleeping so deeply. I was safe and getting care. Within two days, all the care that was weeks or months out started rolling in. Colonoscopy. Nephrostomy and stent. MRI, CT, ultrasounds, x-rays. Cardiac, oncology, urology/nephrology, and all the ologies rolled through my room and them me all over the hospital - it hurt, was terrifying, and in the end the platform needed for care. Killing the Cancer Instead of the Patient On March 18th, I had a power pump installed in my left arm for drawing blood and administering chemo. Five weeks of chemoradiation began shortly after. Radiation Monday through Friday, with a chemo pump Monday through Saturday, a Monday infusion of Emend, Kytril, and dexamethasone, followed by Wednesday and Saturday fluids with Kytril and dexamethasone. Here is what I will tell you about this phase and how to survive it. This will knock you down so hard that you will not know which way is up. Radiotherapy and oncology like to point fingers. Fuck the fingerpointing. You will be so fatigued that sleeping 12 hours per day will be about all you can do. You must stay hydrated and it’s hard even with two hydration bags going in twice a week I ended up in the hospital with dehydration twice and a whopping kidney infection. Enterade is a drink that helps calm everything down after radiation and chemo and helps to limit the GI damage both can cause. Get Ultima drink powder, make up two gallons and put them in the fridge and pre-fill four one liter bottles - keep them next to you so that you can see them. When you wake up, down one. Kiss your appetite good-bye. You still need to eat. I found that baby-food stayed down the best. Once upon a Farm is a good national brand, and so is Yumi. Kate Farms makes tasty nutritional shakes that don’t give you explosive diarrhea. I could not stomach meat or dairy, and managed to take only gummy vitamins and gummy pre/probiotic supplements. Spices hurt my mouth and throat and my stomach kicked them right back out. My doctor prescribed Zofran sublingual, compazine, and Ativan - compazine in case the Zofran didn’t work, Ativan when the nausea and vomiting was driven by anxiety. I spent a lot of time carrying around a one gallon ziplock - they came in handy. Saltines and plain soda water do help! You’ll have a break after chemoradiation - at least two weeks. Sleep. About Power Ports GET THAT PORT. INSIST ON THAT PORT. It will save you endless bullshit with collapsing veins later as chemo and radiation both make your veins brittle. Insist on anyone drawing blood or giving an infusion use that port. Get ready to call bullshit when they say that they can’t. I had bruises up and down my arms until I told them to get someone to access the fucking port or I would damn well walk to Cedars if I had to. Be aware of the increased risk of blood clots. Your arm may swell and that needs to be seen and treated right away, usually with a three-month course of Eliquis or other blood thinner. You could take aspirin as a preventative with your doctor’s approval, but I’m allergic to that and other NSAIDS. Turmeric, ginger, black pepper, cinnamon, and cayenne all have blood-thinning properties, but I could not keep them down. Likewise, grapefruit juice or supplements can enhance (not in a good way) blood thinning medications. About Nephrostomy Bags They fucking suck. A nephrostomy should be reversed six to eight weeks after the surgery, and the stent in the ureter (not the urethra) takes over. You cart your piss bag everywhere, wake up to make sure it’s not overflowing. You’re at an increased risk for kidney infections. Here’s my tips for living with the motherfucker. Order only name-brand bags from Amazon. You’ll want to change out the bag once per week. Keep the big bag for when you’re at home, the little bag for when you have to go out. Coloplast, Bard, and Medline are all good to use. There are bag covers, bag carriers, and even clothing to keep your bag concealed, catch leaks, and stop punctures. You might want to tape your connections to prevent accidental decoupling. Also, insist on a home health nurse to change that dressing - the angle is such that you can’t do it yourself. Friends You will make friends in radiation and infusion waiting rooms. You’ll share space with them in infusion clinics. You may lose them. It will hurt. At the same time, you’ll be happy and heartbroken. You’ll share tips and tricks, highs and lows, and a fellowship that can’t be described, only experienced.",tumblr

The desperation to cling to whatever shreds of normalcy you still have in your life not just because the denial is so alluring but because it’s so emotionally exhausting to be “cancer girl” 24/7. 6. The terror of anticipating the physical ordeal your body is about to go through because we haven’t yet figured out any way to treat cancer that doesn’t involve massive cellular damage.

non-terminal,"Medical reality check Medical reality check Sometimes I feel as if the time since February has been a long, strange bad dream. Mom’s decline into severe dementia came at the same time I was diagnosed with cancer, with her coming off the rails at the same time I was hospitalized and given the nephrostomy. I met with my oncologist yesterday, and I got a big check. “I’m sorry that she’s gone, but maybe now you can fully focus on your own health” Having my focus all for myself. There’s a concept. 85 percent of the people diagnosed with my type of CRC at stage T4a die. I am one of fifteen percent who survived treatment and surgery and achieved remission. Roughly half of those who start treatment at that stage do not make it to surgery, the stats are worse for those who have to have the resection before chemo and radiation. It is also very likely that this cancer will recur and/or metastasize. As a friend said, I am on the measured mile. It’s terrifying, but also freeing. Doc also said that when I talk about not bouncing back, not getting better as fast as I want, that they treated me with the most aggressive radiochemotherapy and a second round of 5-FU or FOLFOX-5 (called by chemo buddies ‘the five fuck yous. He reminded me that most people could not survive the treatment. He reminded me that I have time and to cherish it. To think about whether I am trying to heal for myself, or to please others. To internalize that I am on pain meds to ease the pain from damage left by my treatment, and that the pressure to get off them and 'be better’ is a medical decision - not one that needs to be decided by people who think I shouldn’t take oxycodone for pain that can hit a seven or eight on a bad day. 10 is the pain I woke up with after the big surgery in November 22. I woke up screaming. I was on 10mg of oxycodone every four hours for six weeks.I am now on 5mg every eight-twelve hours. I may be taking these along with robaxin and gabapentin for the rest of my life. For my test results, my white cells are all normal or low normals. I may not rebound since these levels have been steady since the end of December, and will have to take greater care to avoid getting sick. I will get sicker, and stay sick longer.

I didn’t have the energy, and at several points it would have been dangerous to have someone to come in and do it. When your treatment is whacking your immune system, and you get sick, it’s always more serious. I’m doing a lot better, but it has its ups and downs. My kitchen and bathroom are finally cleaned to my satisfaction, and I am going to take a crack at cleaning the rugs today. I’ve been concentrating on the big Out - getting rid of stuff that I don’t want to die with in my house. Yes, I am still in remission, but remission is fragile. I want to have things neat and tidy, and good to go in case I need to go back into treatment. I’m not being a pessimist, I’m being a realist. I understand the power of positive thinking, but I also understand that if 20 people were in a room together, and had the type and stage of cancer that I was diagnosed with, only three of us would survive. It’s a point I have to make over and over to some people, and I can’t even tell you how tired I am of making it. Sorry, I needed a little rant. Yesterday was a lot of errands. I had to go pick up my meds for the month, go to the bank, stop at FedEx Office, and then run at Ace Hardware. It was a very long and tiring run, but my Uber driver was super cool. He even went into the hardware store with me. My building is going back to covid protocols, we have had a lot of sickness in the complex. And I had covid back at the beginning of July. Apparently, there is a new strain to be concerned about. It was the same at the hospital with people being met at the elevators with masks and hand sanitizer. I did find the wrench that I needed, and the part to fix my sink. Our building super is currently hospitalized, and they are trying as much as possible to avoid spreading anything further through the tenants. Even though my white count is better, it is still in the lowest range of normal. I’m really not up for the risk. Otherwise, I did order a new steam mop after my old one died, and I really have to say that Bissell makes one hell of a product. Most cleaners just put layer after layer of crap on your floor. That’s why when you’ve been in a place for a while your floors are sticky. I have always used a steam mop ever since they came out. I think this is the best one I’ve ever had. I am strong enough now to lift a 4 gallon stock pot, and can easily empty the dehumidifiers. I can do the stairs three times per day, but it’s very tiring. Tai chi and resistance bands do help. The lymphedema in my right leg comes and goes, and seems to respond to some kind of inflammation going on. Friday and Saturday were very painful for me, and I had two huge patches of psoriasis. 🐝 Turned me on to using zinc oxide powder, and it makes one hell of a difference in a very short time.

I mentioned a purple pixie lady in the kitchen (and if I didn’t call her that I should have… turns out she’s the landlady. Cool, good to know. Landlady has a PHD in physics, is obsessed with nutrition and practices acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. (Before I continue, I would like to state that I am aware that acupuncture and Herbal Medicine – Chinese or otherwise – can do amazing things. But I’m also aware of the number of people who take some sort of online course, get a certificate from the University of Bullshit, and brazenly practice their ‘craft’ on actual people) Today, Landlady told me about a woman from Brazil she’d treated who had cancer. (I don’t know what it is about the chemo look, but everybody suddenly wants to chat to you about bloody cancer) Landlady had treated her with acupuncture and with herbal teas and tinctures. The cancer had gone into remission. ‘Oh’ exclaimed Brazilian lady. ‘I can’t believe it’ And she went home, where upon it was discovered her cancer was back. This, according to Landlady, was Brazilian woman’s own fault because she didn’t believe it so she messed it all up – because QUANTUM! Do you know how much willpower I had to burn through to keep my expression mild and not brain her with a skillet? I’m all for any weird and wonderful additional treatment you care to take with your chemo and surgeries. But what pisses me off an apocalyptic amount is when people with very serious life-threatening medical issues are given false hope – and worse, made to waste time – with random bollocks that might make you feel holistically healthier but won’t do a damn thing to fix the underlying problem that’s killing you. Bitch, if fucking acupuncture and some tea could fix me, don’t you think the hospitals would be offering that instead of the incredibly expensive and poisonous course of treatment they gave me? Also (do I really have to point this out) medicine isn’t something that requires belief to function. If it requires belief, it is at its base, a placebo. Look, I think quantum is great too – I love the fact that you can kinda explain sympathetic magic via string theory. But again, if Quantum was powerful and reliable enough to kick the shit out of cancer, I wouldn’t have gone to the Infusion Centre every three weeks I’d have gone to the Quantum Detanglement Centre or something.

non-terminal,"Text from the WP: The Ambiguity of Remission Text from the WP: The Ambiguity of Remission There is an art to living in a constant state of health ambiguity — something 18 million cancer survivors in the United States well know. When award-winning feminist literary scholar Susan Gubar was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in , she assumed it was a death sentence. Fifteen years later, thanks to experimental drugs, she’s still in remission. Gubar’s brutally honest book “Memoir of a Debulked Woman” gave voice to the complexities of living meaningfully despite the specter of mortality. I recently interviewed Gubar, 78, via email about living with cancer. As a 57-year-old blood cancer patient myself whose mother and maternal grandfather died at 60 of blood cancer, the topic is personal. The following was edited for length and clarity. “The question mark of remission can feel like a sword of Damocles. When will the cancer return? How long have I got” Gubar says. Q: You write: “Remission, I could tell you, would always have an invisible question mark after it. … Remission brings a heightened sense of contingency, of being healthy-but-only-for-a-while, and therefore the anticipation of waiting for the other shoe to drop” How do you live with that “question mark? How do you find joy when wellness is precarious? A: The question mark of remission can feel like a sword of Damocles. When will the cancer return? How long have I got? And those fearful imponderables spawn others. Will there be an available treatment that I can endure? Can I bear to go through the life-in-death of being a patient again? But if the remission lengthens, the question mark generates an exclamation mark. I have survived 15 years after a diagnosis that gave me three to five years! I received an experimental drug in a Phase I clinical study that many could not tolerate, and it worked for nine of those years! For the last two years, I have been on a drug holiday — because long-term use of the medication can cause leukemia — and I’m still here! When the question mark of remission produces an exclamation mark, the exultation has everything to do with astonished gratitude for the bonus of unanticipated time … in which I have seen my children marry, welcomed grandchildren into the world and fussed over my beloved husband. What more can one ask for! There’s still a question mark, but there’s also a thrilling exclamation. With the passage of years, terror shrinks while thankfulness swells. Q: “Watch and wait” is the medical stage when cancer is being observed but not treated. Seasoned patients know it as “watch and worry” How do you live fully despite anxiety? A: No one wants to be counted among “the worried well” Yet it is impossible not to fret at aches and pains that might portend a recurrence. It is also impossible not to suffer from “scanxiety” as scans, tests or biopsies loom. I search for distractions: trying out a new recipe, watching a movie. A good book can provide a voyage away from myself into another realm. Unfortunately, it fails to transport me on the day one of my daughters, who inherited the BRCA mutation , goes into the hospital for a scan. She is among the previvors: survivors of a predisposition to cancer. I have resigned myself to the fact that the day of her testing will be given over to fright. Q: Most people run from conversations about death. In what ways has facing death brought you clarity or comfort? A: Like Buddhists and hospice workers and activists for medical aid in dying care, I believe that anticipating and preparing for one’s own death paradoxically leavens morbid perseverating, especially when it puts us in touch with networks of people also contemplating their proximity to the cusp of existence. Which is why I continue to attend twice-monthly meetings of my cancer support group. I have had to say goodbye to a succession of friends in the group. Our conversations help me find the praise songs, eulogies and elegies that many of us will want to accompany our dying. With the time remaining to me — and neither the well nor the ill know how much time they will get — I do not fret about things I have left undone. Like Steven Petrow, I seek joy. But, as many philosophers have pointed out, joy can be elusive. It is often a byproduct of activities related to some other goal: baking bread, making a quilt, writing a book. So, despite my physical impairments, I keep busy. Q: Many patients find it difficult entering through hospital doors — over and over — for ongoing treatment and care. Your description in “Memoir of a Debulked Woman” hit home: “Upon arrival, the Shakespearean stage direction: ‘Enter, fleeing’ echoed like a refrain in my head” What hacks do you use to endure hospital visits? A: I hate entering the hospital in which I underwent so many ghastly operations, infusions, radiological interventions, CT scans and blood draws. I bring toys: an iPad (with podcasts and games on it, knitting (socks are especially portable. Since all of my cancer history occurred in one place, I was lucky to make friends with some of the staff. Until recently, the pleasure of a gabfest with Alesha Arnold, my research nurse, offset the horror of the place; but Alesha died of lung cancer this year. At my next visit, I will look for the plaque explaining that a fund has been established to honor her: It will sponsor an annual award for nurses who manifest her loving and meticulous caregiving. Then I will sit in the waiting room and remember how Alesha protected me from unnerving responses to my liminal situation. Patients like me need from our companions what Alesha had: the courage not to sugarcoat our precarious conditions. I learned from her how to pace myself to the syncopation of fear and hope that accompanies my passage in the perplexing terrain of remission, a borderland between wellness and sickness.",tumblr

non-terminal,"Celebrity, Cancer, and the Sword of Damocles Celebrity, Cancer, and the Sword of Damocles Shannen Doherty is a little younger than I am and is a Woman In Public with cancer. Good God, that is one tough bitch. Cancer strips away so many things we take for granted, puts us through so much. When she was first diagnosed eight years ago, I had sympathy for her. I knew treatment had changed a lot, and I was hopeful that she’d ‘beat cancer’ Now I’m looking at it from the inside, knowing that remission is not beating cancer. I love her for spreading that out there and having the courage to say it. We love pretty pictures, happy endings, inspirational stories. It’s okay, but they ring hollow from the inside. People mean well, but there’s almost a guilt when you have to disappoint them. Remission means they can’t find cancer right now. If you make it past five years in remission, you’re considered cured, but if the cancer comes back- I got my blood test kit yesterday and will gave my draws done in the middle of next week. I’ll find out if I am still in remission just before Christmas - it will be my year if I am still 'cancer free’ Shannen said what’s in the mind of so many cancer patients: “I’m not done with living. I’m not done with loving. I’m not done with creating. I’m not done with hopefully changing things for the better” she says, cracking a smile. “I’m just not — I’m not done” And: “I know it sounds cheesy and crazy, but you’re just more aware of everything, and you feel so blessed. We’re the people who want to work the most, because we’re just so grateful for every second, every hour, every day we get to be here” She’s fallen out of remission multiple times and the cancer previously metastasized to her brain, for which she had surgery. Now it’s metastasized into her bones - the five year survival rate is 29 percent - and she’s looking for clinical trials or experimental treatments. I hope I can be as brave since my chances of falling out of remission are 85 percent. It’s like walking around with a bomb strapped to you, never knowing when Mr. Cancer’s going to press the button. It’s the reason I have kept my power port installed in my left arm - I beat the odds the first time with CRC 4A. I am not going to coddle myself with pretty pictures and inspirational 'beat cancer’ twaddle. I am going to live as if every second I have is a gift. She’s right. The sky is bluer.",tumblr

non-terminal,"I have to talk about something because I realize I haven't yet (it's about biology) I have to talk about something because I realize I haven’t yet (it’s about biology) Oxyphil cells are super weird little guys that I learned about while looking at histology slides for anatomy (this was back when I thought I wanted to do nursing. We don’t know their function so they’re kind of a mystery! They mostly start to appear after reaching puberty and then increase in number as we age. They’re also known as oncocytes ( onco meaning mass or bulk + cytes meaning mature cell) but they go by a bunch of more specific names depending on their location. Plants don’t have them btw but we do and so do other animals. They have bigger mitochondria that act like gymrats on steroids and more of them compared to the average cell. Apparently they even have more mitochondria than the cells that make up your muscle tissues, which is insane since you can imagine how many powerhouses it would take to fuel muscle activity. I tried to find a vid to show what they look like and I think this youtuber does a good job at that Sometimes benign (as in unlikely or slow spread, not cancerous, sometimes malignant (as in spreads like wildfire, cancerous. They’re literally just tumor cells, which would make sense since oncology is the study of cancer. The reason they have so many overpowered powerhouses (still talking about mitochondria) is because they require a LOT of energy breakdown. Your body’s cells love love love carbs (like sugar) so much that it prioritizes using them over other nutrients to make stored energy readily available for uses like muscle contractions. The inefficient way to break down sugar (caused by oxygen-deprived conditions) is kinnnnd ooooof like an Italian grandma making tomato sauce from tomatoes. When Grandma’s tomatoes enter into the sauce-ification machine, it has two exits. One exit spews tomato sauce and the other is where all the separated seeds and skin go. Sometimes Grandma pops the seedy skin bits back into the top of the machine to get a little extra out. The oxyphil’s mitochondria work like Grandma’s machine! Stored sugar (the tomato) goes in and some usable energy called ATP (tomato sauce) comes out while also making this other byproduct (the seeds and skin. That waste/byproduct, pyruvate, can be reabsorbed by the mitochondria to make even more energy in oxygen-deprived environments, producing lactic acid. This localized lactic acid literally makes your body more acidic but your body is usually pretty good at flushing it out (fyi drinking water helps with this process… This is also why they tell people to drink lots of water after getting a swedish massage. In the case that it isn’t clearing itself out enough for whatever reason, like say maybe you consistently produce so fucking much lactic acid because you have a tumor with MANY overpowered af mitochondria. Well… You might be pretty acidic there. Good news is you can raise your body’s pH to be more alkaline via deep breathing (this would make your body oxygen-rich so that you can break down sugars more efficiently. You can also eat more alkaline foods like red cabbage and leafy greens. Anyways that’s all I know about oxyphils and I wish we knew why they exist. It feels so cynical to think they exist just to cause death and I don’t really believe that anyways since not everyone gets cancer. Are oxyphils how the body adapts to make more energy readily available in oxygen-deprived conditions, resulting in acidosis? Does that acidity break down neighboring cell walls? Does that mean they permeate the cell membrane and get that healthy neighboring cell to start dysfunctioning too and the cycle continues? Also why aren’t they present at birth? If it’s true that they come from chief cells then they wouldn’t really have a chance to form since chief cells are also not rly present at birth. Food for thought! I just want to know their function and have been for like two years blaaaahhhhh Also here is a video of how a grandma makes her tomato sauce. She doesn’t put the seedy skin bits back into the machine but some people do. I hope it helps with the analogy",tumblr

And I was diagnosed with a relatively straightforward, well-understood form of cancer, at a time in my life when I was in excellent physical shape to fight it. Had this happened twenty years ago, with the science at the time, or twenty years later, in an older body, the news might’ve been different. Larger than all that, however, was the actual crossing of the threshold: going from “not someone who has cancer” to “someone who has cancer” Everyone I hadn’t told yet was someone who had unconsciously sorted me into the group of people who had never had cancer. Or, perhaps, it was more about me: before I told someone, inside their mind existed a world where I didn’t have cancer. Telling them would change that world, and the version of me that was inside it, forever. It wasn’t that it was hard, or emotionally taxing, or devastating to tell people. It was that every time I told someone, another world in which I didn’t have cancer ended, almost as if I was giving myself cancer all over again. I wrote about Kate Middleton’s cancer announcement, my own cancer diagnosis (3 years in remission now, and how we maybe should all extend each other a bit more grace. I hope you’ll give it a read.

Howdy folks, I am (un)officially cancer free for the first time likely since I was about 18! I’ve been dealing with all of this since I noticed a lump on my 23rd birthday in August last year; I spent my Christmas getting surgery and my Easter is being spent recovering from my first (and hopefully last) radioactive iodine treatment. And yesterday my doctor told me that by some miracle, even though my cancer had remained undetected for much longer than average, I didn’t show any signs of metastases. I have faced so many of my fears in the last year, and it is just such a relief to know that this is over, that I can finally rest and return to normal, that I won’t have to take any more unnecessary time off work. It all just feels like a miracle, which is mostly thanks to the amazing doctors I had through Cleveland Clinic.

This is an open invitation to anyone wanting to learn how to harness the power of nutrition and holistic therapies in the fight against cancer, regardless of whether or not you choose to use conventional treatment. Nutrition is our first, most powerful medicine and it’s administered three times a day. We improve symptoms and our chances of healing when we provide our body with the support it needs. Some of the things you will learn in this webinar. 1. Leveraging fasting (autophagy) and detoxing to encourage cell repair. 2. The power of juicing to provide cells with essential nutrients and to oxygenate the body. 3. Nutrition to alkalize the body and support its powerful healing mechanisms. 4. Holistic therapies that can help reduce inflammation and encourage quicker recovery and healing. I am also thrilled to announce that I will have a special guest and courageous cancer survivor join me who has healed by implementing the nutrition, therapies, and methods that will be discussed. I cannot wait for you to hear her powerful story of inspiration and hope. To everyone else, she goes by Patti. To me, she is Mom. Since this is a topic close to my heart, there is no cost.

Today’s blog is mental health and cancer. Cancer is synonymous with mental health, environmental factors, genetic changes, bad lifestyle choices and exposure to carcinogens. I have had family members die to mental health, and mental health and cancer. Let me address mental health and cancer separately: Mental Health Cancer is the reason why taking care of your mental health is incredibly important. For every issue and concern you’re not dealing with and are troubled by, that resides in your unconscious, which means you’re creating the potential for cancer. Reading mental health and lifestyle books can be helpful, as they provide a sense of connection with the author who may highlight similar experiences to yours. They may also offer insights and coping strategies. It is important to think about getting help if you or someone you know is struggling with mental health. Cancer Statistics The phrase “Cancer stats 1:2” is clear. 1 in 2 people will get cancer in their lifetime. The statistics can vary widely depending on the type of cancer, demographics, geographic location and other factors. The statistic, indicating that one in every two people will develop cancer at some point in their lives, is a commonly cited statistic that highlights the prevalence of cancer. However, it is important to understand that individual risk factors play a significant role and not everyone will develop cancer. Regular screenings, healthy lifestyle choices and awareness of family history all help in cancer prevention and early detection. Both mental health and avoiding cancer are important aspects of overall wellbeing. It is essential to take proactive steps to care for both your physical and mental health.

By chance, she had had the same cancer around my age. By chance, she asked me if we had ever done an ultrasound of my thyroid while I was getting my annual pap. I had 0 symptoms. I was stage 1. By chance, I got the right surgeon. I am not in any pain and haven’t been since day 1 of recovery in the hospital.

The tumor on our layrnx had grown so large that swallowing ANYTHING (yes even spit and water) had become a monumentally painful task. all the doctors agreed the best course of action was to shave down the tumor (they couldnt just remove it without destroying our voicebox) and place a feeding tube thru the skin and muscle directly into the stomach. do you recognize that description? they placed the tube directly above our naval, and now it appears as if we have 2 bellybuttons. 3 doses of chemo (cisplatin) and 3 months of radiation. mama came back from philly to be with us. we couldnt afford to live anywhere so our friend carol (65 year old japanese woman and her son, seymon) let us live in her basement while we were being treated. its so strange to think we were homeless while we had cancer. its strange to think that counts. i met a woman on the street who had cancer, every hospital refused to treat her because she was homeless and had no where to stay. they called her a liability. we spent 3 months in carols basement. 3 months in our tiny pink room, beneath the earth. we felt undead- we watched as our cheeks and eyes sunk into our skull. we watched our hair thin, but not fall out. this chemo didnt make your hair fall out, and idk about you but something in me almost wished it did. even sleep was affected; we never watched to touch the tube, so we folded our hands across our chest and slept like a corpse every night. we didnt eat or drink anything with our mouth for 3 months. the formula was made by nestle. you know, the chocolate child-slavery company. apparently nestle got its start in formulas before ever touching confectionairy. in order to eat, now i know you remember this, we had this comically huge syringe- i mean the damn thing looked straight out of a cartoon- and we would pour out the formula into a container and slurp it up into the syringe. our feeding tube didnt look exactly like this, but its close enough. you see the part that says Y-adapter? once the syringe was full wed pop off the plug, open the clamp, and pour formula directly into our stomach. yum. we couldnt taste it but the aroma would waft up from our gut into our throat sometimes. it tasted like cardboard (and was quite sticky to the touch. do you remember how it felt every time it hit our stomach? this was also the only way we could drink water, being thirsty and hungry became a whole new sensation. we began to miss chewing so much we found this website that sold chewy stim toys for autistic kids and adults. it was a littlw blue robot, its hanging on our wall now. couldnt bare to get rid of it. it was also the height of the covid lockdown. very lonely time to have cancer, we fought constantly. fighting fighting fighting- cancer, ourselves, our mother, our feelings, our memories, our desires, our own happiness, our humanity, we fought it all. we were mean and selfish- caught in the ol selfdestructive misery loop.

Last year the immunotherapy drug I had been on for 6 years caused ventricular tachycardia of the heart which caused me to immediately stop therapy. This news was three days after attending Suga/Agust D’s concert in Chicago. What a downer to come home from that amazing, phenomenal concert. I resumed a 2nd generation drug 3 months later which caused additional heart issues and had to reduce the dosage and subsequently stop that therapy in November. There were only two options left, one being a regiment of chemotherapy that would put me in palliative care, or the other option being an autologous stem cell transplant. This option could potentially add several more years of life in partial/full remission. Unfortunately the cancer will come back and I will get that palliative final round of chemo. I chose the stem cell option and started the process 3 months ago with an oral chemo drug to kill cancer cells. I had a high dose of infusion chemo this past Friday and started daily injections on Sunday to create new stem cells in my bone marrow that will be moved to my blood stream for harvesting in two weeks. It will take up to 4 days to harvest the stem cells and then frozen until transplant day. I will then go into the hospital for extreme chemotherapy to kill off my immune system (red and white blood cells and platelets) for a medical “rebirth” where my harvested stem cells will be transplanted back into my bloodstream for engraphment into my bone marrow. So again, I am just telling my BTS family and friends while asking for your prayers and well wishes as I complete this new medical journey so that I can see my beloved BTS boys in concert next year.

The Beverly Hills, star gave people hope, and despite her passing — which can be exceptionally heavy on other late stage survivors, it’s important to keep going and not lose faith in your own journey. Doherty was over four years into her advanced stage diagnosis and had gained a powerful voice in the health space with her Let’s Be Clear podcast, holding nothing back as she aired out past personal struggles in her career and love live, and candidly spoke of her day-to-day fight. Actress Shannen Doherty became a household name after starring in hit shows like ‘Beverly Hills, ’ and ‘Charmed’ “This is what I am currently facing. ” Doherty captioned what would be her last video post . The day the world woke up to the tragic news, comments came pouring in on Instagram for the late pop culture icon. “Rest in peace.

Everyone is entitled to their feelings, and yes, the emotions are real, even if you consider yourself “just a fan” The stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. These labels help us frame and identify what we may be feeling. These stages can also occur in any order. The time it takes to navigate these stages can also vary, so giving yourself grace and patience is essential while navigating your feelings. “It often gets better over time, but on certain days, it can look like depression, and on other days, people look perfectly normal and can function” Dr. Scott Irwin , a board-certified psychiatrist and Director of Supportive Care Services at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, previously told SurvivorNet. ‘Grief Comes in Waves’ Dr. Irwin added that grieving people are coming to terms with “the change in their life; the future they had imagined is now different” SurvivorNet also had a prior conversation with Megan Newcomer, who lost a close friend to metastatic cancer in . She shared her unique way of coping with grief. Newcomer’s friend was an athlete and soccer player, so to help her cope, she embarked on a marathon race in his honor, and advises others grieving to first “acknowledge your feelings” Shannen Doherty was a passionate animal rights activist.

It could be something very simple, but I do think having it be intentional is what you’re doing to help honor this person” In a column for SurvivorNet, New York-based clinical psychologist Dr. Marianna Strongin expressed that it may be helpful to remind yourself that these feelings are “meaningful yet temporary” “If you approach them with compassion, kindness, and eventually acceptance, you will come away from this period in your life more connected to your resilience and strength” Dr. Strongin added. Understanding Metastatic Breast Cancer Stage 4, or metastatic breast cancer, means that the cancer has spread to distant areas of the body. Even though there is currently no cure for metastatic breast cancer, doctors have many options to treat this advanced stage of breast cancer. Hormone therapy, chemotherapy and targeted drugs are all options to talk to her doctor about, depending on your individual needs. Sometimes surgery and/or radiation is considered as part of the treatment, but mainly it is important to focus on improving your quality of life. Dr. Erica Mayer , a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, says clinical trials have shown that hormone medicines are more effective when paired with targeted therapies. At some point, chemotherapy will be introduced. And according to Dr. Mayer, it’s delivered at a dose and schedule that’s as well-tolerated as possible. “We are so lucky in breast cancer that we have so many effective and well-tolerated treatments” Dr. Mayer previously told SurvivorNet. I’m so gratified to see that patients are doing better and living longer today with metastatic breast cancer than they have ever done before” Bottom line, there are more and more options becoming available for patients to manage symptoms of advanced stage disease, and it’s best to talk about specific treatment plans and what is best for you with your own doctor. Treating Metastatic Breast Cancer With metastatic breast cancer, the primary goal of treatment is to control its spread. SurvivorNet offers information about what those options are from targeted therapies to chemotherapy and when these various treatment options can be used. We also provide information on new, exciting research that is currently being tested in clinical trials and information about when recently approved drugs, like immunotherapies, can be used. For help finding a clinical trial that may be right for you or a loved one, try our easy-to-use Clinical Trial Finder . While there have been many developments in recent years when it comes to treating late-stage breast cancer, which therapies can be used will depend on the characteristics of the patient’s cancer. What are the treatment options for late-stage breast cancer? “Metastatic breast cancer is a treatable disease” Dr. Kenneth D. Miller , medical oncologist at the Alvin & Lois Lapidus Cancer Institute at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore shared in a pior interview with SurvivorNet. “Fortunately, we have so many new treatments for women with recurrent breast cancer and for many women who look at this as a chronic disease that they can live with — often for many years” * RELATED : ‘Stage Four Needs More: Metastatic Breast Cancer Requires Dramatically More Research Investment’ Say Advocates Mourning ’ Actress Shannen Doherty RELATED : For Patients, The Inspiration of a Famous Actress And Her Quest to Make Sure Her Affairs Were in Order — Mourning Shannen Doherty RELATED : Crusading to Save Horses, Shannen Doherty Says ‘We Have To Speak For The Voiceless’ RELATED : ‘Not Done Living & Loving’ Said Actress Shannen Doherty– She Placed Hope In Experimental Drug Trials To Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer",tumblr
non-terminal,"Dealing with disquiet over Kate’s cancer video Dealing with disquiet over Kate’s cancer video Readers comment on an article taking a different view of life after treatment from that presented by the Princess of Wales Sun 15 Sep .56 BST I’m grateful to Hilary Osborne for helping me understand why the Princess of Wales’s video left me so disquieted (Kate’s recovery is great news – but be wary of a soft-focus view of life after chemo, 11 September. I had stage 2, grade 2 invasive breast cancer last Christmas, with talk of chemotherapy after the tumour biopsy – until genomic testing gave me a reprieve. So I “got off lightly, and need to “look on the bright side, as some friends unhelpfully remind me. There are some silver linings, but all cancer is crap. And even without chemotherapy, I still feel greyed-out. My heart aches for Kate, and broadly speaking I’m a royalist. But did her PR team really have to add so much saccharine? And now I feel just a bit more rubbish about myself and my failure to fully thrive after my own tough, but less tough, year. Ali Hutchison Dorchester, Dorset I completely agree with Hilary Osborne’s article and also felt that while being pleased that Kate has completed her treatment, the jarring and somewhat smug video was inappropriate, and perhaps even a little insulting to those who have experienced this journey in the real world. My memories of this journey are of fear and terror of how the mortgage and bills were to be paid, how my deeply distressed daughters would cope if I died, and how on earth I would pick up the pieces of my life if I were fortunate enough to complete this gruelling treatment. The privilege that oozes from this video made it unrelatable for those ordinary mortals like myself who had to navigate the same (but very different in so many ways) path. I am certainly no royalist, but I also felt that if such a soft-focus cinematic video had been released by Harry and Meghan, the media reaction would have been very different indeed. Jane Dove Isleworth, London “There is … a childish outspokenness in illness” wrote Virginia Woolf in her essay On Being Ill. Things are said, truths blurted out, which the cautious respectability of health conceals. Was the short video in which the Princess of Wales wanted to share her illness no more than someone diagnosed with cancer who wanted to tell a wider circle than her family and her close friends? Perhaps she felt a need to share her feelings with the rest of the world. Many of us have been in similar situations, although without the restraints of royal life. We want to share with others who are happy to listen about the burden of illness. Perhaps later, Kate, as many others, will look back on this video as a mistake. Many of us have been there and spoken more than we normally would. Let us hope that she will one day look back on this video and ask herself why she felt the need to make it. Juliet Clibborn London Hilary Osborne’s article resonated with me. The year after finishing chemotherapy and radiation was not a good one, despite the knowledge that I was cancer-free. Also, being more or less hair-free for several months while it started growing again was difficult. There was that greyness that Hilary mentions, and there was feeling angry, and invisible, and there were despairing tears at work. Afterwards, it took nearly a year for me to feel (which means “look) normal again. Good for Kate that she’s better. She’s lucky that the treatment she had didn’t make her lose her hair. But she must know that many others undergoing chemotherapy aren’t so lucky. Since she’s chosen not to share the details of the type of cancer she had, or the type of drugs she was given to treat it (which spared her hair, in my opinion she probably shouldn’t share the artificial, golden-filtered view of life post-cancer in her video either.

non-terminal,"""Come on, motherfucker, you survived, you gotta give yourself a break"" “Come on, motherfucker, you survived, you gotta give yourself a break” That lyrics from Everybody Lost Somebody by Bleachers has been stuck in my head for a while now. Almost got it made into a wooden plague before I remembered my finances. On February 9, , I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin lymphoma after suffering with symptoms and misdiagnoses for over a year prior. And on November 4, , I was declared to be in remission. The entire process was hell. Every two weeks, I would go in for an infusion of nivo+AVD for two and a half hours, followed by five days of dealing with poison. The body pain, the nausea, the weight gain, the fatigue, the cognitive decline. I hated it all. For a while, I was mentally okay as I just had to focus on getting through chemo week. But the monster of self-doubt and self-loathing mixed with the stress of the ordeal. Was I even really suffering? I only had Hodgkin lymphoma, one of the most treatable cancers where I live. And I was on immunotherapy plus chemotherapy, a less severe alternative to straight chemo. And I lived an unhealthy life. So maybe I deserved it. Maybe I deserved cancer. Evil fucking thoughts in an evil fucking time. Shit that I am ashamed to admit. Shit that I am scared to share with people. But they were mine, and it made an already soul-scathing year even more relentless. So here I am in survivorhood. People have told me that survivorship is not the end of it all and now I fully understand what they mean. The fear of relapse, how every symptom could be a sign of recurrence. The grief of losing almost a year of my life to cancer, not to mention the other health issues treatment has brought about. The burden of those around me knowing what I am now, the feeling that they feel I am no longer capable of much. The knowledge that they are right. I am fatter and dumber than ever and I have so much shame and self-hatred around all of it. And why I quoted that song in the title: the feeling that I should and need to just move on and be normal. I am still unemployed. I am still poor. I am still in massive debt. I am still professionally pathetic. Nothing stopped when I got my diagnosis and treatment. I initially took my remission as the permission to live normally, but I can’t get back to that normal. I am not the same person I was a year ago. I have trauma, I have fear, I have limits. I’m slower in every sense, less capable, and now less forgivable. I don’t know what it would mean to process things or get better. I have spent too long looking up ways to get my brain back only to not remember or stick to any of it. I incorporate workouts and diets only to struggle with losing the massive weight I gained in just one year. But I need to be normal, or at least act it. I need to be capable. I need to get a job. I need to get smarter. I need to be reliable again. I need to be respectable again. And I needed to accomplish all of this yesterday. Something in me wants to listen to my therapist making the same push that lyric is. I have been through a lot. I need to recover. I need to process. But I don’t have the time or, as it feels at this point, the capacity. And the shame of my diagnosis still lingers in here, too, feeling like I do not deserve any rest. I did not really suffer. I am just lazy and incompetent. Motherfucker, it was stage 3 cancer! Is that not enough? Apparently not to me.",tumblr

non-terminal,"Hi! Just a little introduction. my name is E and i'm 20 years old from the North East of England. Lets start from the. Hi! Just a little introduction… my name is E and i’m 20 years old from the North East of England. Lets start from the beginning. I have always lived in a little town, a place where people never really leave, theres not much here and pretty much all of us dream of getting out! I went to primary and secondary school as normal, leaving school thinking I wanted to be a hairdresser, then a children’s nurse, i’m sure one time i said i wanted to be a therapist? My point is at the age of 16 when you leave school you have no clue what you want to do with your life, so many things can happen and influence your life. So… from leaving school i decided to start Level 3 Health and Social Care, and to be honest it was going great, i was really enjoying it. One day i started getting pains in my arm and shoulder thinking it was from the gym as i had been going often. The doctor told me to stop going to the gym for a while and rest. The pain never went away it only got worse. I carried on with my college work and social life going out with my friends with this pain still bothering me. After constant trips to the doctors and hospital, painkillers, a few scans, x-rays and a biopsy, i was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma. A type of bone cancer that i’d never heard of. I had to get multiple rounds of chemo, operations, deal with hair loss, a shoulder replacement, permanent loss of movement in my right arm and so much more. Having to deal with all of this at 16/17, i did not have a clue where my head was at. I went into remission in October that year and i have never felt so lost in my life. All of my friends had just got on with their life and were much further ahead than me, it was like i had paused life for 10 months and just came back to reality. I had a few part time jobs like hospitality, care work, beauty, you name it. Fast forward to 4 months ago when i completed my Level 3 Beauty Therapy qualification. I had finished it but that still wasn’t what i wanted to do in life, so i had a break from education. My current job is working in a jewellery shop which i absolutely love! However, its not what i want to do for the rest of my life. I want a career not just a job. I decided to start a Humanities course in September as it had a lot of different paths to follow. i started to think about y interests and things i love to give me an idea of my dream job. I love music and concerts, pop culture, celebrity drama, movies, knowing whats happening in the world. I finally decided that journalism is what i want to do. So now i’m here… I feel like starting this blog would be the best way to get a bit of experience and confidence in writing. That was more than a ‘little’ introduction but if you want to know more or come along for the journey with me feel free to follow me or send me a message )",tumblr

I should be able to go several days with a bag but right now I’m going through several bags in a day. I’ve got WOC (wound and ostomy clinic) nurses on the case though, so hopefully we’ll get a handle on that soon. I saw my medical oncologist and he’s got me in for a CT scan tomorrow. That’s because I start chemo next week and they want a baseline snapshot, so they can watch the tumor shrink. Next Thursday I start 6 cycles of FOLFOX, which is a lot less than I’d expected, but the chemo is to shrink things and clean up the margins of the primary tumour and mets so they’re more easily removed by the surgeon, and my primary tumour is already pretty localized. As the oncologist said, it’s the surgery that cures the cancer, not the chemo. I’m guessing they think that if the chemo goes well, I’ll get to where they need me to be in 3 months rather than 6 or more. Anyhow, I’m unreasonably excited for the poisoning to begin!

non-terminal,"So.I had breast cancer. And it was terrible. And whatever is left is.also terrible. So…I had breast cancer. And it was terrible. And whatever is left is…also terrible. I did everything I was supposed to. I went to the doctor and got my scans. They found a “suspicious” spot but after an ultrasound I was cleared and worry-free. Eight months later I was diagnosed with Stage 3A Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. I was so angry, but mostly terrified. Everything about early diagnosis is awful. All of the scans and tests are incredibly painful, which I really didn’t expect. The biopsy consisted of me holding a young nurses hand and her crying with me while the doctor basically stabbed a nail through my breast to collect tumor tissue. It hurt so badly. Then, when I had my first MRI, I was lying face down but on a ramp with my breasts hanging down. Unnatural and also, of course, incredibly painful. I was just started to call out and ask them to please stop when Justin Bieber’s Stay came on the headphones and I didn’t feel all alone anymore. I knew that I immediately wanted my breasts gone. Both of them, gone. Immediately. It didn’t matter that my right breast hadn’t betrayed me, my killer left boob had made the decision for both of them. Two weeks after diagnosis I had my double mastectomy. I was so pitiful after that that I even made the nurses cry. I had a male nurse come in and check on me the next day and he told me he’d gone home crying. I must have been awful. Thankfully, I don’t remember it. I think most of it was because they wouldn’t let my (then) four year old in to see me. I did get to see my two older boys though, thank goodness. My friends dyed my hair a beautiful pink. I had never dyed my hair before and I was so happy with the outcome. I could have kept that beautiful color forever. I went straight into chemo. The Red Devil was every two weeks and at one point I remember sitting in my kitchen wondering if I was dying. I think I probably was. I was also bald now. No nose hair, no eyebrows or eyelashes, nothing. I looked like a turtle. But I was too sick to really care. I didn’t even mind the Neulasta shot every two weeks. I moved on into Taxol, and it was actually just as bad for me. During this time I was put into the ICU with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs (MANY, and was on oxygen for months. The night before I was hospitalized I told my middle son I felt like I was being stabbed in the back, but hey. It was just massive blood clots. *sigh* After chemo I found out that I now have Lymphedema. If you know what Lymphedema is, you know how terrible this is. If you don’t, let me just tell you- it’s so terrible. When I had my double mastectomy they also removed 39 of my lymph nodes under my left arm and six of them were cancerous. And now the fluid doesn’t drain from my arm and gets stuck in my arm and chest and neck and I am miserable. I did treatement and have a pump and wear sleeves and all that, but it is still miserable. At the end of chemo and beginning of radiation I bought a house. I want you to know I remember none of it. But I love it. ) I wasn’t expecting radiation to be bad but of course it was awful. Nothing about cancer is fun. The burns burned. The skin broke. The pain pained. My stomach did NOT stomach. It was truly terrible. After that I had a year of injections. And a total hysterectomy. And pills. And bone pain, depression, anxiety, nightmares, hot flashes, and, finally, heart surgery. It was a hell of a couple of years. And if they’d diagnosed it when I got my first mammogram, I don’t think half of it would have happened. What’s happening now, though, is that cancer never really left me. It’s always on my mind and in my thoughts. With every pain and ache I’m convinced it’s back to get me. I hope that this anxiety and fear eventually leave me. Please get your scans and check ups when they’re due. Take every step you need to take. You want to stick around, even when things look bleak. There’s always a better day coming.",tumblr

non-terminal,"Hello! It’s been really hard for me to maintain this blog but I would like to write about my experiences post-treatment, so expect to see a few more blog entries! I’ve been thinking a lot about cancer and endings over the past few weeks. One of my neighbours died at the beginning of March - his organs started failing and he passed away as a result. He was really kind to me during my treatment and kept encouraging me to keep going despite the horrible side effects of chemotherapy. He told me that we’d get through it together and he planned on living until at least 90. Another one of my neighbours has just been diagnosed with breast cancer and I keep finding myself passing on all the maxims he taught me over to her. He was a lovely person and he will be sorely missed. It makes me stop and appreciate the fact that I’m alive, I’ve survived, I’m doing really well; I’m so grateful to be in the position I am now. Not just the fact that I survived chemotherapy & cancer but that I’m better mentally. I re-read all my posts and I could see how I became more and more depressed and hollow by my posts and lack of posts. I’ve just finished a 12 week course of cancer counselling therapy and it’s helped me so much. My counsellor taught me that it’s okay to have feelings and it’s okay to be tolerant of myself. I’ll talk about it in more detail at a later stage because some of the tips and tricks he taught me are really useful, regardless of whether you’ve had cancer. On Thursday I have my first check-up since my last chemotherapy. To say I’m scared and worried is to put it mildly. I keep having crazy nightmares where my neck is covered in lumps! I’ve found it really useful to read this booklet about the process when you go for a follow-up appointment. In fact, the website has some pretty good booklets on lymphoma in general - definitely worth a look whatever stage you’re at. So allegedly lymphoma has a higher chance of coming back within the first 2 years of remission - that’s going to be a very stressful two years! The booklet also said that most people know that they have cancer because the signs start to come back. I’m probably going to regret saying this, but I think I’m okay. I have scar tissue from my main lump but it hasn’t changed size in the past three months except for a few days when that side of my neck was a little swollen. I’ve also recently been pretty tired over the past few weeks, but I think that’s a combination of getting up super early to do extra shifts at work and being stressed out about my upcoming appointments. Nothing will stop me worrying about it (if people didn’t worry about appointments then that would be a cause for concern, don’t you think) but I’m going not going to let it overwhelm me. I’ll let you know more after I’ve had my appointment.",tumblr
non-terminal,"June 16, I’ve been stuck for a few months now, not just about what to write, but about what to do. In May, I found out my 6 month check up scan was still clear of any signs of lymphoma. Last time I was in remission, my 6 month scan was when I found out the cancer was back, so this meant going into uncharted territory. Glorious, cancer free, uncharted territory. But I still wasn’t off the hook. The scan results also showed pneumonia in one of my lungs, landing me in the hospital for four days, a not so gentle reminder that, cancer or not, my immune system still isn’t what it used to be. During those days I finally accepted where I am now, where I’ve been since February or so: Remission Puberty. Stay with me now, I know that sounds strange, but it makes sense to me. It’s the awkward stage between being sick and well, and, like the awkward phase you go through in middle school, it’s confusing and frustrating and it sucks. It’s having enough energy to go to classes but not having enough to keep up with the homework. It’s feeling well enough to go to a party one night, and then spending the entire next weekend watching Netflix because your potassium levels are running low for some reason. It’s “I’m sure you’ll be fine, but it’s probably safer not to do it” when you ask your doctor about almost anything. It’s almost impossible to successfully navigate, and confuses everyone around you just as much as it does you. Basically, it sucks. And it’s still where I’m stuck, but I’ve decided it’s time to get out. My doctor advised that, if possible, I not take a job or internship this summer, and instead work on my health and getting myself to what I’m now calling Remission Adulthood. I’m lucky enough to be in a position where I could take his advice, so that’s what I’m doing. And it’s hard. It’s hard to know if it’s good that I’m spending all day watching Bob’s Burgers because my body needs the rest or if I should be pushing myself to get out of bed every single day. It’s hard to know if pushing my lungs to get me through an 8 mile hike is a good way to build their stamina or if it’s just completely dangerous. I have to ask myself these kind of questions every day, because the answer is usually never the same. But I’m getting better at figuring out the right one. I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’m still in Remission Puberty, but I’m ready to get out. It’s time for Adolescence, at the very least. So I’m back, and I should be posting more often now, because a big part of getting to where I want to be is getting back to writing, and not just about cancer anymore.

Why is it that I, who was diagnosed with cancer, get to return to school when Chris, who was going out to grab dinner, does not? What are the odds that out of everyone, he would be fatally shot, and that a cancer patient would outlive him? More than ever, I’ve been thinking about what do I do with the time I have? I know we all ask ourselves that, and I wish that I now had a more direct path to follow, or some great answer. But I don’t. I plan to make the most out of myself this semester as a film student, though. I still plan to work with kids who have cancer when I can.

You’re just seeing what you want to see, ignoring what she’s saying, and speaking over someone with a mental illness that shouldn’t have to explain themselves for having a safe space. Just going to block this baby before she continues to shit her diaper . Honestly, I don’t think discussing eating disorders means they’re promoting them. They are SO stigmatized. Let’s stop that. Recovery is not fast, recovery is not easy, and recovery is not immediately. I don’t think that someone should be labeled as an eating disorder promoter just by voicing about how they feel. If I say that having the flu feels actually pretty good to lay in bed all day, am I promoting catching the flu? NO. Having an eating disorder was and is one of the hard at struggles I have ever battled in my life. If you have not lived through it, do not tell people who are how they should feel. Would you tell a veteran not to reminisce about a bloody war? Mental illness is NOT. A. CHOICE. “Illness” is the key word. Don’t preach about things you haven’t experienced! *sigh* so saying “I purge last night for the first time in a while. Honestly it felt so good to be hungry and empty after. I’ve gotten really bad with it in past but I’m gonna keep doing it. I’m a little scared” isn’t promoting eating disorders then?

non-terminal,"Anxious Ugh. I woke up around 3am and haven’t been able to get back to sleep. I have to get up for work in two hours. I hate insomnia. It’s because I’m off my painkillers finally (I was on them for eight months while battling leukemia) and even with a three week taper, I still had withdrawal symptoms. The worst of it is mostly over (stomach cramps, aches, restless legs) but I’m still sneezing and yawning ALL THE TIME and I feel like I’ll never sleep soundly again. I’m anxious about everything. My blood pressure is literally higher, so there’s that. To make matters worse, a close family member AND friend have developed a bit of a heroin habit over the last few months. I not only have no real support system and nobody to talk to about my own difficulty getting off painkillers, but I have to deal with this. It’s SO DIFFICULT to feel SO MISERABLE with that shit not only being at my fingertips but being offered to me. It’s almost comical. I haven’t ever taken any, nor do I want to. The only thing keeping me away from it is that I have a feeling I would *not* be a functioning heroin user. I strongly suspect that I would pretty quickly wind up dead or in rehab. I just know myself and how easily I develop a dependency on opiates. Heroin is a line that I just should never cross. It’s scary that it has become such an easy thing to get. Like, these people I know that are using - I would never describe as addicts or anything. I guess they are now, but you’d never know it. At the moment they are functioning and % in denial that there is even a problem. I doubt that will last forever though. On top of all that drama, I can’t stop worrying about my first follow up with my oncologist in June. Now that I’m off the painkillers, the cancer saga finally feels over to me. It’s sinking in, and I hardly know what to do with myself. I also am anxious about finally being able to TTC after that appointment (assuming I’m still in remission. I’m kind of dreading the fact that it feels like we’re starting from square one. The nine months TTC before I was diagnosed with leukemia were just so damn depressing. I simultaneously can’t wait. I want to believe so badly that this will be our year. I’ve been distracting myself by reading lots of Malec fanfic. I have no idea why I became obsessed with this (I didn’t even finish the books - and only started watching Shadowhunters with a mild interest. I don’t even usually gravitate towards slashy fanfic.

What is the harm? If it doesn’t come back, it doesn’t. If it does, it won’t be as devastating. If you’re constantly telling me, “BUT ITS NOT GUNNA COME BACK” You don’t know that. I am not exempt from my cancer coming back just cause you don’t want it to. Just because you think I don’t deserve it. Just because you think I’ve been through enough. I am not living in fear, I am prepared for anything. What would you rather hear? “Well I thought this could happen and I am ready to do treatment x and y” or “You kept telling me this wouldn’t happen and I really thought it wouldn’t! I really believed it was over! I can’t think clearly enough to decide on treatment X or Y”",tumblr

non-terminal,"My Battle With Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Exactly a year ago today ( July 22, , we found out that my cancer relapsed. I didn’t know how to react soon as I saw the CT scan results. All I know is my mom and my sister were crying, while my father was holding his emotions back, but the sadness was written all over his face. I went to my room because I didn’t want to breakdown in front of them. I couldn’t accept it. I was in denial for days. I don’t remember how many days it took for it to finally sink in. There were days when I’d wake up and think that it was just a nightmare… that I could still continue living my normal life. But I would always, always wake up to the reality that it wasn’t just a bad dream. That my cancer’s really back. One of the reasons why I’m writing this post is because I learned that some people are feeling awkward towards me. Maybe because they don’t know the right words to say to me. Some people are curious and have a lot of questions about me having cancer, but couldn’t find the courage to ask me. Please know that this is still me. I had cancer, but cancer never had me! You can always talk to me or ask me anything. I won’t be bothered or be offended by it. But for now, I’m going to share my battle with cancer to you. I’ll just summarize it because it’s a very long story and I might start crying here if I go through the details. My battle with cancer, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (a cancer that starts in white blood cells) to be specific, started when I was 15. It all began with a lump on my neck. It was fine needle aspirated, biopsied, but turned out negative. Then it was surgically removed. Biopsied again. Then positive! I have cancer… I, then, underwent treatment. I was in remission for 4 years . Then as we all know, cancer’s a traitor… it came back . At a very young age I’ve been through a lot already. Bone Marrow Biopsy was the worst experience ever! I can still vividly remember the excruciating pain I felt that time. I undergone neck surgery as mentioned above to remove the mass on my neck. And bronchoscopy to biopsy again the lymph nodes in my chest when my cancer recurred. I started getting used to the pain of inserting an IV line in my veins every now and then. One try is tolerable, but you know what chemo does to your veins. So there were times when they’d poke me more than once (5x max. And of course, chemotherapy. I had 4 cycles of chemo before + 6 cycles of chemo recently. Imagine going through those hellish sessions. Not to mention, 1 cycle is equivalent to 2 sessions! It was sooo tough. To me, the side effects of chemo were bone pain, muscle pain, body pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and sore veins. I was given after-chemo meds, like steroids, which made my face so swollen, and made me eat like a monster that’s why I gained so much weight. That evil drug caused me insomnia too. Of all the bad side effects of chemo & other drugs, the good thing is that I didn’t lose my hair, it just thinned out a bit! But I experienced being bald too like other cancer patients. The first time I had HL I shaved my head before going through chemo so I know the feeling… I know how painful it is to lose your hair. After 6 months of chemo, I am again in remission now. But the battle never ends here. It would take time for everything to fall into place: my body to return to its familiar shape, my immune system to function well again, my hair to grow after cutting it pixie style, my battle scars to fade. What they don’t tell you after cancer is that there are new struggles in the aftermath. There are times when I would look in the mirror and not like what I see. Post chemo side effects are not just physical, but psychological as well. We, as cancer survivors, have a never-ending battle with the demons in our heads . We are emotionally wrecked. After going through cancer, people might think that we are back to normal but we can never go back to our normal selves after such a life-altering fight for survival. The anxiety, depression and the fear haunt us every now and then. The “scanxiety” every PET/CT scan is horrible. This is so hard for us, especially the cancer patients and survivors of my age, because we are still young and we are just about to experience life and reach our dreams. But then again, our new “normal” is much more rewarding because we surely did learn a lot. We learned how precious and fleeting life is, and that it is supposed to be treasured and enjoyed. That life is indeed short. That we are stronger than we know. That God can move mountains. That our families will do anything and everything for us. That health is more important than any material things in life. It made us appreciate the little things and be more grateful for every day. We also learned who our real friends are. Through this battle I’ve met a lot of brave cancer warriors. I’m very thankful that I found a support group for cancer patients and survivors around my age, and made a lot of friends. It’s a blessing to have this kind of people around me who I can talk to because they are the ones who would understand me the most, knowing that they know exactly what I’ve been through. I couldn’t mention each and everyone of you, but co-warriors, you are all an inspiration to me. You guys are amazing. To anyone who knows someone battling cancer and in need of moral support, feel free to message me so I can introduce him/her to our small support group. Now, I’m proud to say that I A TWO-TIME CANCER SURVIVOR . I am not my body. I’m not weak, fragile, or delicate or any other phrase that somehow describes the state of my whole physical self. I am not my cancer, nor will I ever be. So far, I have endured everything life throws at me. It hasn’t been easy. It was so devastating, but I’m still here… TYPING, BREATHING, LIVING. I will live my life to the fullest and I will not let cancer dictate me on how I should live my life. I will be vigilant but I will enjoy life. I’m surrendering everything to God. My pains, my anxieties, my worries, and most importantly— my life. I’ll never lose faith that He would always restore me. I don’t know if I’ll relapse again. It’s scary, but I don’t want to worry anymore. Life is too short to be stressing over the things I can’t control. God has given me so much reasons to have faith in Him even when I don’t understand Him. And I will be faithful in Him even more when things are blurry and when things are not going my way. Having cancer twice is physically, mentally and financially draining. My family and I are beyond thankful for Makati Shangri-La’s EMBRACE project for sponsoring my chemo drugs and other lab tests. I will forever be in awe of the people behind it. God really works in mysterious ways! To you who are reading this, please don’t take your life, your HEALTH and the people around you for granted. Spend time with your family and friends. Always tell them how much you love them. And if you are struggling right now, whatever battle you are facing, always run to God and know that you are not alone.",tumblr

non-terminal,"UD. A week ago this past Saturday, on September 30th , my Uncle Dan (my dad’s brother) died from liver cancer. He was 63. This news came in just a few short days before receiving the news I was in full remission. Certainly an Ebb to the current Flow. While the end was not surprising, how quickly it came, after official diagnosis in late summer was just another reminder how serious this cancer shit is. Unfortunately, although he had many symptoms over the last few years, he simply did not get any answers that gave him any chance of beating it until it was far too late. We are, and always have been the primary champions of our own health. If something feels off, and continues to, we all need to keep pressing and digging until we have an answer. There is always an answer. Many times unfortunately that answer is cancer - but with early detection you give yourself a fighting shot. Your body gives you signs. Listen to it. Ok… Enough about that… My Uncle Danny, (what I called him when I was really young) Uncle Dan (thru the high school years) and UD (a nickname that stuck during the beer fueled young adult years through the end) was quite a remarkable guy. A forever “bachelor farmer” without any significant other or kids, simply loved the outdoors. As an avid hunter and fisherman he reaped what he sowed. Always enjoying the deer or other wild game he bagged - including the sunfish he tricked into taking his bait in one of his hot fishing holes. Living off the lake and land in his humble abode on Rock Lake just outside McGregor Minnesota. He was one of the first guys I ever knew that started brewing his own beer. We are talking late 80′s early 90′s. He had no idea how much of a killing he could have made up here in the Pacific Northwest with his perpetual hoppiest possible brew with the IBU’s and an Alcohol By Volume (ABV) level (if they were to be measured) maximized to match. Pair that with all of his unforgettable catchphrases (that when he said them, were uniquely UD) from “You Betcha, “For Sure, “Think About It, “F It - Smoke It, and many, many more - the man was a human branding machine. He was a man of extremes. Either all the way in, or all the way out. There was no middle ground with UD. He did what he wanted, and if you didn’t like it, too bad. This translated both into some of most delicious smoked fish and homemade maple syrup I’ve ever eaten to the some of the most awestruckingly myopic and ignorant political/social belief conversations I have ever been a part of. That was UD. Meticulously freezing frame as a freelance photographer on the wing of a hummingbird sipping a sugary solution just outside his window to just not showing up somewhere because he “couldn’t find it” - so simple and complex all at the same time. I will forever cherish the times we shared together - from it being the first time I ever played Super Mario Bros. (he was an early original Nintendo adopter - a major bachelor benefit in , listening to his sing along baritone over his favorite Merle Haggard song, getting a metaphorical nose bleed from one of his room clearing farts that were derived from a diet of venison (venny) and home brews - or just listening to him, while we were both sheets to the wind, laughing until my stomach hurt, tell stories from his past exploits (fishing, hunting, motorcycles, girls, etc) with a confidence and swagger so off the charts, that it would make Kanye West blush. What a guy with a style all his own. He will be really missed. Certainly gone too soon. Love you UD. Rest in peace. - Photo from December .",tumblr
non-terminal,"description of radiation process & interesting news regarding chemo - My first two days of radiation have been good. I’m allowed to plug in my own music while the proton beam machine does its thing, so if anyone wants to make me a playlist, please do! My Spotify username is maggsburgs - just share it with me there. The radiation process is actually super cool. What happens is: I lay on what they call “the couch” which is really just an oblong metal thing that has my specific headrest attached to the end. Then they snap my mask onto the headrest (pictures coming asap! I promise haha) and thennnnnn they turn on the music I choose and tell me which place in “line” I am for the beam. I’m pretty sure the beam rotates between four different treatment rooms, so I am either first, second, third or fourth in line. If I’m first in line, I don’t have to wait, if I’m second, I wait like 3 minutes, and so on. Once the beam is available for my treatment, they radio into the room I’m in and say “We have the beam, we’ll begin shortly” Then I hear some weird kind of clicking noises and I know that I am having radiation shot into my head. It’s very strange - sometimes I see flashes of light and sometimes I taste chlorine. Both are just weird things my brain does because it’s being interrupted in a way, if that makes sense. Then, they rotate either me (the “couch” can move both laterally and vertically) or the beam machine (the beam machine is on a huge garage door looking track and can rotate around me, basically) or both, and the process repeats. I am beamed 3x per radiation session. It’s pretty cool! Google proton beam machines because they’re seriously super interesting. I’ll add a picture of one of the rooms that the Mayo treats me in below (as far as I know the treatment rooms are identical. Chemo news: I previously thought that my treatment plan was as follows: m-f radiation and chemo for 6 weeks, a month break and then six months of straight chemotherapy. Yesterday I learned that the plan is a little different than what I had thought. It will be m-f radiation and daily chemo (including weekends) for 6 weeks. Then I get a month break. Then the next six months I do chemo five days a month only, which is such a huge relief. It means I could have a semblance of my old, normal life back. I’m not sure what I’ll do in this regard. I need to talk to my parents about a new plan, now that I’m only going to be sick for a week every month rather than every day for the entire six months. The chemo I’m taking right now is “half strength” and after my month break they will increase my dose with each round. That’s why I’m having such an easy time with my chemo right now. The doctors say that most patients do well the first couple weeks and then treatment starts to catch up with them toward the end of the 6. We’ll see what I can do! I will note that I’ve been extremely tired. People continue to treat me differently than I am used to. I almost feel like the group that treats me normally is shrinking. It’s a bit of a let down, but I do think it’s really cool to find that I can empower myself in such situations. I’ve had like 4 different guys say they don’t want a wife or kids in their lives. It’s strange because no one has ever said this to me in such an unprovoked way, and it’s happened so many times (additionally, it’s not like I’m bringing up marriage or anything haha. I find it a little rude, but It doesn’t really bother me because A) I understand why a person wouldn’t want to build a future with someone who was diagnosed with something so intense at such a young age and B) it’s honestly a good weeding out process. You’d be surprised - having cancer has absolutely crushed my dating life, but in a way it’s also made me so much more prepared to move forward in a realistic, pragmatic way. Which I will admit isn’t the most romantic, but hey, what’s a girl to do. I think I’ve decided that when I am done with cancer treatment I want to do a PhD program in philosophy - I’m thinking ethical theory right now. Who knows. Also - New York / New Jersey was exactly the break I needed. I love my Allie and Allison. Thanks for keeping me sane. As always - I love you",tumblr

non-terminal,"somewhat interesting Because of the chemo I’m taking, I have to form a bunch of goofy little habits to keep others from being exposed to the chemo. It’s really good for me but really bad for everyone who doesn’t have my specific diagnosis. 1. When I use the bathroom, when I’m done, I have to put the lid down and flush twice to try to get all of the chemicals out of the toilet, lol. 2. If I have sex, a condom is necessary. Normal for me anyway. 3. Only I am allowed to touch my chemo medication. If I touch one of my pills directly with my hands that’s fine, but I have to wash them immediately after. If someone else for some reason has to handle my chemo pills, they need to wear gloves and should probably be washing their hands after. 4. If I sweat a lot in clothes or in bed one night, I have to wash the clothing / sheets separately from other people’s items. Overall a little more safe for me to just wash my stuff separately.

Also slightly bummed and nervous, obviously bc it’s so new to me lol. I had a care appointment with someone from my chemo team and she said that she’s never seen hair loss for the chemo I’m on, so I’m happy that hair loss will only be an issue for a little bit. She also told me that 90% of side effects that people typically feel during radiation / chemo time is mostly from the radiation, so I feel like that’s a really good indication that I will be fine when I do my six cycles of chemo post radiation.

non-terminal,"Week 3 of Radiation: hair loss, weed, fatigue, ear stuff? Update on symptoms - ♡ Frankly, I’m tired all the time. Marijuana helps me in this respect - it gives me energy. Like more than coffee does. It’s the weirdest thing to compare smoking recreationally in Colorado to smoking medicinally here. Someone on one of my teams said that people who use marijuana just tend to do better over the course to treatment, so that was nice to hear. ♡ I’ve had a few more headaches that are getting minimally worse. Nothing I’m worrying about at this point. ♡ My hair is starting to fall out in little wisps. It freaked me out when it started (bit of a sobering moment to be staring at a fist full of your hair, but I’m getting a lot more comfortable with it, though and I’m happy that I’m not losing my eyebrows or anything. Figuring out wigs is hard enough, I don’t think I could handle trying to make eyebrows look realistic too lolol. Probably will buzz my head within a week and just switch to wigs and whatnot. It’s strange bc I won’t be completely bald - it’s just where they’re beaming me that I won’t have hair growth. Get prepped for a strange look and a bunch of ballin’ ass wigs (I have 2 so far. ♡I hear random tones in my ears sometimes. Also not super concerning but something to note. If it becomes a constant thing then it’s a problem. ✿ I know I keep saying it over and over but I really am amazed by how many people have been reaching out to me. It’s clear what kind of community I have around me and I couldn’t be more grateful. It’s looking like when I move back to the twin cities, Walker and I will hopefully be roommates somewhere in St Paul. VISIT ME! everyone plz.

I’m in the middle of week 5(of 6! When you’re done with radiation, it’s tradition that you ring a bell on the way out of the clinic. I am so excited to ring that damn bell. They did push back my last day because the hospital is closed on Thanksgiving and I need a certain number of radiation sessions. So my last day of radiation is Monday, November 27. Cannot come soon enough. Yesterday was a lot of appointments: I had radiation, a care provider visit, and a social worker follow up. Radiation was fine but I’m very frequently exhausted and I literally fell asleep during radiation so that was a little disorienting (admittedly kind of funny. During my care provider visit we went through my list of medications and coordinated all of that. And then my appointment with the social worker was almost like a therapy session. We talked about the logistics of my future considering the fact that I need a lot of MRIs in the near future. I also learned that most brain patients similar to me only do 5 weeks of radiation SO that was weird to hear. I WISH I ONLY HAD 5 WEEKS. She also told me about this awesome place further north in MN that has polar bears! I must go when treatment is over. I’m going to be doing my 6 rounds of chemo (which start 28 days after nov 17) in St Paul, and then I’m going to launch from there when this is over. I might go back to Chicago, or maybe I’ll make a random move and nanny for a year and then go to grad school, or maybe I’ll just go straight to grad school. We’ll see which direction I feel pulled in. I like not knowing! I can’t wait for my life to be unpredictable again. I think that’s what’s been frustrating me recently - I am in such a strict routine and I have so many rules that it kind of lowers the level of spontaneity in my life. I also realize that I’m extremely lucky with how my body is handling this - I don’t feel terrible every day, my chemo is totally fine, I’m just sleepy! I feel that i’m a very lucky cancer patient in that way. I literally haven’t even really lost weight since this all started! Kind of crazy. Also have not thrown up still. All hail Temozolomide.

non-terminal,"Road Trip One of the gifts of being a cancer cabana boy is having the luxury of time to attend to important matters. Having left the security of paid employment (for the insecurity of sole proprietorship and developing four different lines of business, I have also picked up the flexibility of time. Time to take Meagan to oncologist visits and scans. Time to do research and engage in talks and discussions about the disease and the options moving forward. I’ve also spent lots of time counseling our boys, so they are able to plan and figure out how they respond to their situation. What a tough thing to have to do, right as you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do and explore all the possibilities life offers, you have to deal with a mom who has a scary and unpredictable disease. Fortunately through the magic of technology (text messaging, skype video chats, phone calls) we’ve been able to be responsive. Both Meagan and I have made it a priority to be there for them when there query process surfaces. They are both at different stages due to age and school completion so the challenge for each is unique. Casey has decided to withdraw from the University of Colorado to be home and close to his mom during this period of uncertainty. He’s planning on working, reading, exploring future career options and developing a plan for an expected gap year next school year, before ultimately returning to college. He’s been very thoughtful about this and we support him wholeheartedly. I get the pleasure of flying to Boulder today, and driving back with him to Seattle on Friday and Saturday. I’m really looking forward to our discussions and time together - a true gift. I probably won’t post for a couple days - although maybe to shake things up a bit I might post some pictures from the road.",tumblr
non-terminal,"Road Trip Lessons A very nice two day ride back with Casey from Boulder, CO. Thus the absence of posts. We made excellent time thanks to good weather. I did learn the the Best “Western Plus” in Boulder meant, “plus noise. Not what I was expecting. The eastern part of Wyoming is pretty bleak country. I had not realized how industrialized Billing, MT was - it appears to be the coal capital of Montana, where coal=electricity. Of course, we had plenty of time to talk, about this change for him and what he’s thinking. The crisis with Megan is obviously the trigger event, but he’s also using it as a real opportunity to think through his life and what he wants to be, do, and how he can have an impact. He also doesn’t want to have any regrets, and being away from Meagan during her treatment was too difficult. I’m so impressed by his new gravitas and thoughtfulness, but one comment stuck out in my mind particularly. He said, “Dad, I want to fling myself at life. Wow. If we could all do that, what would our lives be like? Cancer has a way of sharpening your thinking and shifting your priorities. It certainly has for me, although admittedly at my stage of life the priority shift has been about what I need to do to support Meagan. In the case of a 19 year old, it means something else. It means life is short (relatively speaking and one’s own can be short with respect to expected lifespan, there are great adventures and experiences out there, the system can pigeonhole you and put you on a track to unhappiness - so break the mold, step back and decide consciously and carefully what you want to do based on who you are and what your passions are. So our job as parents in this case I think is to provide unconditional love and support. I expect there will be plenty of self propulsion - I am not worried about lack of activity or not taking responsibility for his actions. It does mean stepping back and letting him dictate both the process and the direction. Offering perspective when asked. Helping him understand disease progression (or stabilization or remission) so he can plan and making sure he will trust me to let him know when he might be needed. I can’t wait to see where he flings himself…",tumblr
non-terminal,"Yervoy Yervoy is the new trade name for Ipilimumab, the drug Meagan has been on for her melanoma. She’s finished with her course of treatment (it was 4 infusions of about 90 minutes each time, over a 9 week period. She got a scan at the start, one at the 12 week mark (tumors grew, bad sign) and has her final 16 week scan this coming week. Where do these pharma companies come up with these names? Ipilimumab was hard to pronounce and we heard it pronounced about three different ways. Even our oncologist just called it “Ipi. So I get the the need to rename it for their upcoming marketing push. But Yervoy? How about YerCured? YerGonnaBeAlright? YerOnTheWaytoNoEvidenceOfDisease (or shortened even further - YerNearlyNED? What the hell does the “voy” stand for anyway? YerVoyage is just starting on our expensive treatment? In our case - we just hope it means it’s working.",tumblr
non-terminal,"A Funny Example of the difference in gender We had a funny exchange a while back illustrative of the difference between men and women. We had received some not so good news, and were in the days following that. Clearly emotions were running high, between concerned and forward looking to possible treatment options. But there are times when you are not researching or talking but simply stewing in your own juices trying to make sense of it all (and of course it doesn’t make any sense. After a few days, we were sitting in our cozy little spot, and she asked me a question. “Did you cry today. Well, as a matter of fact, I had not cried THAT particular day. I had on an earlier day - well maybe teary is more like it. I do cry - even at sappy commercials and shows. I know guys get a bad rap for not crying. I certainly felt plenty of emotion THAT day - it’s not like it had gone away. But in hearing that question, and knowing that I hadn’t cried THAT day, I instantly felt defensive, like I had somehow screwed up and not shown sufficient emotion in light of the gravity of the situation. Maybe I wasn’t being supportive enough, or showing enough vulnerability to match her emotional needs. She had definitely cried THAT day - as well as pretty much most days. I did answer truthfully, that I had not cried. Then, being the much more enlightened guy that I am now, instead of just assuming that my initial supposition was correct, I asked her why she asked me that question. After some pause, she responded along the lines of, “well, if you cried I would be much more worried, but if you are not crying it must mean you are still positive and convinced we will ultimately prevail. Whoops! Not crying turned out in this case to be a good thing, a supportive thing, a thing that enabled her to continue to muster the amazing courage she has shown. So instead of feeling defensive, I felt better, and that my response was indeed reassuring. It is a complicated emotional world in which we live…",tumblr
non-terminal,"Scan Day, Again When you have a chronic disease such as melanoma, scans become part of your life. Hopefully at some point they become less frequent than our monthly ones at the present. Most patients end up getting them quarterly, and then managing aspects of the disease (i.e, tumor removal. The ultimate goal of course is to become disease free, but for melanoma patients currently that is not realistic, you simply want to be NED (no evidence of disease. So you undergo systemic treatments (treatments not going after particular tumors but ones that try to ramp up your immune system to go after tumors when they emerge. You try one, scan some period after, if it works and you are NED, great, if not, you move on to another. If tumors pop up you manage them. The short-term goal is to buy time until the long-term, durable, permanent cure is discovered. One lesson we have learned from the scans though. Have the scans one day, and the oncologist visit the next. There is a lot of temptation and pressure to find out right away. But there needs to be sufficient time for the radiologist to review the scans, write the report, and for the oncologist to review all that, talk with the radiologist, before having the conversation with you about results and next actions. We crammed it all into one day once and got incomplete information, which led to a wrong conclusion, which scared the hell out of us. It was rectified the next day, but we went through needless anxiety. So never again. Today is scan day. Tomorrow is oncologist day.",tumblr
non-terminal,"Scan day meal, oh so not tasty",tumblr
non-terminal,"Results days This is not so much about today’s results (that will likely be tomorrow’s post) but about results days generally. There is definitely a heightened tension. Part of it is just the sheer frustration of not knowing how much the disease has progressed. Another part is starting to think about options, what do we do next if it continues to progress, and how to tell loved ones. Then you also start thinking about what else you could have done. Are you seeing the right oncologist (yes, is it time to go to a specialist center for a consultation, are we eating the right things and taking the right supplements. Part of what we try to do each result day is to make sure we have our questions outlined - today we have about 15 and we gave them to our oncology research nurse yesterday so he could review them and give a copy to our oncologist so he could hopefully review them prior to our in-office visit. We also try to take time to calm each other and do whatever each needs to get centered. In Meagan’s case it’s usually a walk and Facebook time connecting with friends or answering phone calls and emails. I go work out. We do talk about the what-ifs as we sip our matcha tee and eat our oatmeal. We continue to focus on “we will prevail” even though it could be a bumpy ride. We know from past experience we’ve had results that weren’t positive - and we knew in advance because she had some subcutaneous tumors pop up in between scans. What we didn’t know was what was happening internally. Fortunately so far the internal growth has been minimal. The hardest part is thinking about the difference between systemic treatment - the stuff that wipes out the cancer - and the tumor management. Tumor management means surgical removal of tumors or radiology treatment. We may have to do tumor management to buy time while we continue to find the holy grail of the right systemic treatment. So each result day you are assaulted by all these conflicting emotions and challenging intellectual options (considering the results and what they mean. And at the end of the day, it is usually pretty emotional, one way or another - relief, or scared. Certainly telling the kids is hard. At that point all you can do is lean on each other and friends and family. But it is hard to communicate to all who are concerned and want to know, because the more times you tell it, the more you can be re-traumatized by the news of the day. Then you end up feeling guilty for not communicating with everyone. But usually mental and emotional exhaustion kicks in and you simply hunker down. So let’s hope today is good news.",tumblr
non-terminal,"Cabana Boy Double Duty I wasn’t sure when I started this what I’d write about. I did know that I didn’t intend it to be a blow by blow account or daily version of the journey. I guess I hoped it would be more reflective. But this morning, when the snow is fresh on the ground and we are just off our most recent scan news, it seems somewhat appropriate to break pattern and give a “live” update. For those interested, read on. We got the results of the scan yesterday. The disease continues to progress. 16 weeks after her initial treatment on Ipilimumab - the alleged wonderdrug - proved ineffective for Meagan. Her lung tumors have grown slightly and there is another tiny one. Plus the ones at skin level have grown and there is another tiny one on her arm. She got an adjustment in her anti-hormone medication from something other than Tamoxifen to Fareston (sp) which does the same thing (block estrogen from attaching to your cells) but without being affected by antidepressant medications. She also got another shot in the butt of Lupron (which shuts down your estrogen production, but at least its the three month version. So the hope is that over the next month her reproductive hormones shut down (they did not last month) and that she has hot flashes and night sweats that prove it - and maybe that might slow the growth - as she is very convinced there is a link to her tumor growth and hormones. So the doctor is willing to give her a month on that before starting her on the hospitalization treatment - Interleukin-2. In the meantime we will be taking a trip to the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland to talk with their melanoma specialists. They have over 15 clinical trials on melanoma - some of which include using Interleukin-2 but adding some other agents. It’s speculative treatment - but that’s what we are up for now. Interleukin 2 on its own has about a 6% success rate with another 9% getting some short term benefit. Doing a clinical trial may prove more effective. We will see if any of those look promising for her based on her particular DNA makeup - probably have them take some tumors out to use - then come back to consult with our home oncologist before making a decision. If we do decide to get treatment at the Institute it would be hospital treatment and it would be there. I’ve done a lot of research and the Institute people are apparently awesome and our oncologist knows the melanoma specialist there and is happy to send us there for consultation. But it would be a drag to have to undergo several weeks of treatment there - but we will if we have no choice. We will still keep our oncologist in Seattle who Meagan loves. Because part of buying time until there is a cure is tumor management and we will need him to help make decisions about removal through surgical or radiation means if things progress. Needless to say yesterday was pretty rough. Given the snow we have we will be hunkering down today just trying to get our emotional legs under us. We may double our anti-depressant and anti-anxiety meds today - hahahahaha. I wish I could say I was exemplary as a cabana boy yesterday. But some days it is just shared emotional pain, and the best you can do is just hug each other and try to get your balance. For those interested here is a link to all the melanoma trials at the National Cancer Institute.",tumblr
non-terminal,"Reflections, Infections and Inflections Cancer isn’t an infection the way a virus is, although it feels the same. For so many ills and diseases the protocol for cure is well known, even though it can be a hard road. I remain impressed by the women we see each day at the cancer center, getting their blood draws, doctor visits, and then chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Their spirit and determination is admirable. I suspect part of what keeps them going is that they have a pretty good idea that the probability of success is quite high. Yes, they may have to live for 5 years not knowing if the cancer will reoccur. But given the treatments and the continuing medications (Tamoxifen) if you were in Vegas you’d bet on their success at becoming disease free. Our road is different, and more challenging. We are now heading down a road of possible treatments which are clinical trials. The work and research being done in this area is quite fascinating. So many bright minds trying to figure out how to unlock the various keys - how to get the right medication through the right pathway to the right spot - based on each person’s unique DNA. So in some ways we have more options now than we thought - our next logical step would be (and still could be) the in-hospital treatment with Interleukin-2. But we are going to use the failure of the Ipilimumab as an inflection point - to go explore some of these promising options. Adoptive Cell Therapy is one of the most promising options, because it uses a combination of Interleukin 2 with a “special sauce. They remove a tumor or piece of a tumor to extract some natural t-killer cells from it. Then in a lab they see if they can harvest the cells. Usually they can, sometimes they can’t. If they see they’re growing, they continue to harvest, possibly for many weeks, until they have about 6 billion of them. Then there’s a three week procedure where they give them back to you. This involves a week of chemotherapy, the infusion of your T cells, then a week of Interleukin 2. And then you wait, and hope that these t-cells are abundant enough, strong enough and smart enough to recognize the bad stuff and go to town on it. The first step is to figure out if Meagan qualifies - based on her particular characteristics and mutations (we already know she qualifies for a similar trial here in Seattle. That will happen when we head to Bethesda for the initial exams, tests, and scans. It would be great if she does qualify. But then it means if we agree to do it, that the path is different. Logistics become more of a challenge. I’m sure they are quite supportive at their end, but still we have a lot on the home front. So it’s a time for reflection on what to do, how to go about it, who to trust, and assessing the potential outcomes and impact. We will prevail. You pick a path and don’t look back. You just hope you’ve got all the right data and perspectives before you make that choice. I’m confident that when we have the opportunity to choose we will be ready. .",tumblr
non-terminal,"Drama Fatigue There is something enormously fascinating about the human (well, let’s say male) brain. Given the enormous stress we’ve been under the last several days since the latest news, it’s no wonder mine's a bit addled. The typical male response to stress is fight or flight. Clearly a cabana boy cannot do either of those things in this kind of situation. So I had to wait a few days. Today was cave day. I went down to my letterpress studio and did a bunch of mindless sorting, storing and transferring of type from one drawer to another. (Total aside - I just got my nine boxes of my new “house” metal font, Caslon, in various sizes and types and am swapping those into my good drawers which are right now occupied by obscure fonts and sizes in incomplete or low count letters. But I’d feel guilty as heck throwing those away, so am making the effort to store them properly - sorted in most cases, in other cases, into a bag with just the name and size - dealing with that will be for another decade. So when the revolution comes I’ll be able to print the manifestos when the power and internet are out. Now back to our story and point. The first job after the cancer news delivery, other than steeling myself, was continuing to provide steadfast support to Meagan that we can prevail. That takes a lot of emotional energy, and a lot of willingness to listen. Listening well, with full empathy and concentration and focus does not come naturally to most guys. There were many times over the last few days when I simply wanted to hunker down. But that’s not what she needed. She needed reassurance and connection. She also needed information (about the National Cancer Institute) and the various clinical trial options. So I was operating at these two different levels (investigator and supporter, while the little primal part of my brain was saying, “run, run away. Fortunately I’ve had a bit of training over the last 9 months. It’s never easy to stay and do your job, but you can be aware at a meta level what your primal instincts are and hit the override button. In order to stay sane, there does need to be some downtime. Sometimes it’s early in the morning, watching first light, and just staring. Or like today. Or watching a mindless game on tv. But cabana boy self-care is a huge part of being in tip top shape to provide the support needed.",tumblr
non-terminal,"Health Care Costs This is not really a point of view about the new health care law, or attempts to roll it back. What I can share is how crazy our system is from the point of view about how insurance does or doesn’t work. And then the more fundamental point which is about the overall rise in healthcare costs. It’s very interesting to look at our bills - which are really insurance statements - and see several things: 1. How much some of the scans and surgeries “cost” as stated by the hospital 2. How much the insurance company reimburses the provider for. There is often quite a large difference between the two. So you cannot really self-insure - because you would be paying the exorbitant face rates the providers bill instead of the much lower rates the insurance companies pay. So I am grateful for insurance coverage, just to get the cheaper rate. The bigger problem is if you change employers and you have a preexisting condition. This employer centered health care system is nuts, it ends up locking people into companies because they often cannot afford to leave them. If you move from one group plan to another, as long as you’ve been on the program for two years, you are ok. But you really cannot move from a group plan to private insurance, even if you could afford the premiums, because they would deny you for preexisting condition. If we really want to unlock entrepreneurialism, we need to enable people to be able to leave companies and get insurance regardless of pre-existing condition. You’d think the Republican’s would be FOR this kind of incentive, wouldn’t you? Instead we prevent thinkers, tinkerers, inventors and entrepreneurs from doing it, unless they take additional massive risk to self-insure. One thing I learned recently is that roughly 5% of the people insured generate most of the health care costs, which drives premium rates and the overall cost of healthcare. There is all this talk about bending the health care cost curve, and making sure people have high enough co-pays and deductibles so that they can make smarter choices about the health care (i.e, cheaper choices. But based on the statistics, most people aren’t incurring big bills and in a position to have to make those choices. They get regular preventative care and then get treated for the normal kind of events that pop up (broken arm, appendicitis, bacterial infection. They aren’t going to look at a menu of choices and say, oh, I’ll take the cheaper option. Even if they did it wouldn’t affect the overall costs very much at all. So what about those 5, who drive the huge health care costs? Two sets of people. It’s people at the end of their lives and the extraordinary measures done to extend life, at huge costs and likely not very much quality of life. It does make sense to encourage doctors to talk with their patients in advance of those treatments and ask them what they would want, based on costs and all the other issues. When this got raised by the Dems the charge of “death panels” came from the Right and the matter was dropped. Shame, shame, shame. It is a discussion we need to have. The second set are patients like Meagan who have a critical disease. Yup, we are responsible for one heck of a lot of medical costs in the last 9 months. Changing our deductible, or co-pay, or showing us a menu of choices and costs wouldn’t have made a damn bit of difference. Whatever it takes, whatever the docs need to make a proper diagnosis and address the issues. I am sure everyone would have done the same in our shoes - and thus the problem. The costs will only be driven down by hospitals and insurance companies collaborating and figuring out bulk purchase arrangements, better information transfer and flow, preventative schemes, and the like. The first PET scan machine was darned expensive, it’s cheaper now, but it could be way cheaper if the initial order had been in the thousands not tens. Lastly, I think it’s a given that health care costs are going to continue to go up, and people will be happy about consuming a larger part of their disposable income (through premiums and co-pays) in health care. I’d rather buy fewer things and have better health.",tumblr
non-terminal,"It's a Long and Winding Road that leads me to grey hair. The twists and turns continue. Honestly it seems like just when you’ve mentally got yourself in order to handle the projected path, something comes and and bam! it all changes. We are learning the difference between FDA approved treatments and clinical trials. In order to participate in a clinical trial, you typically have to have not had treatment for at least 30 days. In some cases you can’t have had a certain treatment and in others you can only participate if you’ve had certain treatments. I get why this is so - they want to be able to measure the impact of their treatment on the patient and if they are already taking some drug, how will they know which worked? The thing about approved treatments is a doctor can prescribe them freely. So it doesn’t matter if you are under a different treatment regimen up until the minute they put you on the next thing. The conundrum of course is that you have to be left untreated for a period of time if you want to participate in a clinical trial - which means the disease will progress for sure due to the forced time lag. So that pretty much sucks. As good as the docs and research nurses are, they don’t know it all, and what they think doesn’t always turn out right. So they end up toying with your expectations. I think expectation management is pretty important, and right now we have a gap between what we thought would happen and what will likely happen. Agility and nimbleness need to be the watchwords for a cabana boy.",tumblr
non-terminal,"The Latest Cabana Boy Challenge It turns out that we are not going to be heading to Bethesda anytime too soon. We may end up at the National Cancer Institute at some point for participation in one of their clinical trials, but not now. The drugs Meagan are currently on, meant to prevent her hormones from stimulating cancer growth, will be in her system for minimally another 30 days (and possibly another 90 days depending on whether some of the drugs are classified as cancer fighters, plus 30 days after that, so the earliest we would go back there would be the first of May and more likely the first of July. That being the case we are back to our original plan. That plan involved being on these anti-hormone drugs for the second month, through March. We then do another set of scans. If there is any disease progression then we go the traditional, hard route - Interleukin 2 - which is the two week hospital stay treatment. She would start right away. I’ve learned not go think about things being cast in stone though. Maybe the anti-hormone drugs will work, in which case she would stay on them and we’d watch. Likely they won’t have effect, so we are preparing ourselves mentally. Because life goes on, getting it done in April and finding out if it works is better. She doesn’t want to start in March, both to give the anti-hormone stuff a chance and because she has a weekend concert adventure scheduled in late March with a friend. May is Riley’s graduation, so that’s out. We are planning on driving down several days before the graduation, maybe even taking a bit more time, and fly back so Riley can drive the fully loaded car home. So the challenge is to help Meagan prepare herself for this upcoming treatment. It’s scary and there is nothing good written about it. She has been online more, becoming more educated about treatments and drug interactions which is a good thing. She’s the one who discovered the previous link between Tamoxifen and anti-depressants which led to the shift in drug type this month. So I think having her more educated and empowered is good. It’s been a gradual process, initially I did most of the research and leaked out that which was manageable. But as time has gone by and she has come to grips with the situation and her ability and need to assert some control, it makes sense for her to get more information, without losing her sense of hope and conviction that we will prevail. But that means you read the bad and the good. So buoying self-confidence and supporting the belief that she can do this treatment is critical. The good news is the treatment will be here in Seattle. That means our team will be able to support us, and it’s easier on our young men. It also means she needs to put on some real weight - the treatment side effects usually lead to weight loss. So she needs to start drinking those protein shakes made with coconut milk. So I have to build her confidence and nag her to eat more. I’m grateful that Casey is now home and can help me on the food front - he’s become very knowledgeable about nutrition thanks to some biology classes and has become an effective and articulate promoter of her eating more. So cabana boy has help this month.",tumblr
non-terminal,"Cancer Humor Cancer of course is not funny. But we have used humor, albeit at times macabre, to help relieve the tension. The power of laughter is well known. I’m not claiming it can cure cancer, but it helps you maintain a positive outlook and every nurse we have talked to have said that the more positive people seem to do better. Two humorous things came to mind today, one actually happening today. First the old event. Up at our place at Decatur we often have multi-family potluck meals followed by games. One of the games involves a form of charades (Guesstures) and another has you trying to get your partner to guess a word by you giving hints, except you can’t use certain words, which are the obvious ones. This was late August after Meagan’s cancer diagnosis (thought to be breast cancer at the time. Now we are a competitive and spirited bunch. The action was fast and furious. Riley was trying to guess a word and a younger member was giving the clues. Suddenly he blurted out for an answer something really far away from the needed word - “Tropic of Cancer. Well, of course that set off a whole series of comments and jokes about cancer, including Meagan being able to pull the “cancer card” if she got close but not quite right on a word. We all knew she had cancer, but hadn’t been talking about it, and suddenly it was just out there, but in a funny, appropriate way. It helped relieve the tension, and led to a lot of laughter. Today, Meagan was telling me about a visit with an old friend. A male friend from high school who she sees maybe once a month. His wife has gone through cancer and they have four kids. He’s very religious. Each time she wants to make sure that I know it is purely platonic. I have told her over and over that it’s fine, I am glad she has that relationship and really, she doesn’t need to keep reassuring me. But given that this is the umpteenth time she’s qualified this relationship, I decided to tweak her a bit. So I said, honey, really, if a male friend wants to make a pass at you knowing you have stage 4 metastatic cancer, with tumors on your back and stomach and lungs, and a big old port a cath (the under skin device used for infusions) on your upper chest, and a series of scars on your back and front - I say go for it! Her jaw just dropped in complete shock. I told her I was just kidding. Really. I know, kinda lame, but sometimes the intensity of the situation and context of cancer just calls for a little levity.",tumblr

His presence is and will be a great source of joy and strength as Meagan becomes disease free, especially through the nasty bits.

non-terminal,"How Can Calm Days Feel So Strange? News flash…nothing happened to day on the cancer front. No new tumors, no scan results, no appointments. Relative calm amongst the troops. Casey and I had a fabulous hike up to Twin Falls (exit 34 off I-90 just past North Bend. We did have a chance to talk about the cancer, and prognosis and pathways - and it was helpful. But mostly an enjoyable day. So why does an an enjoyable day in some ways make me feel guilty? Because there must be something I could be doing. Alas, not so. We have our game plan for March (stay the course with the anti-hormone drugs. We have scans scheduled for the end of the month. We know the plan for April if there is progression. We have Plans D and E (National Cancer Institute and Cancer Care Alliance clinical trials) for after that. The kids are coping. Meagan looks fabulous and is eating very well. We have a second opinion naturopath visit scheduled for next week with someone who specializes in oncology and the link between conventional and alternative therapy. We’ve researched the heck out of treatments and side effect management. So it’s a good day. But there is that taint in the back of the head. Knowing we face a very difficult challenge. Wanting to be in the moment and live each day fully and with high quality. But it is darn hard! Even at the end of the yoga/tai chi/pilates class I take a couple days a week and they have the warm down mediation, I cannot get the topic out of my head. It’s like the cosmic background radiation from the Big Bang - always there and always making a noise. I guess I am not “zen” enough. I do admire those people who are able to empty their minds and be in and of the moment. It’s not me. Probably never will be. So I get to enjoy these good days - and I genuinely do.

non-terminal,"So What Do You Do? A natural conversation starter at parties. But for someone who has left the “official” workforce, that’s a question that sets off a whole range of responses to answers and an unleashing of emotions. Most guys are defined by what they do, not by who they are. So if you don’t “do” anything in a paid sense, as in work for a firm or have some sort of craft or technical skill that enables you to earn a living, the answer you provide can make a big difference in how the evening goes, how you feel about yourself, and how that person relates to you. It also makes a big difference if the asker is male or female. “I’m a cabana boy, my wife wife has a serious form of cancer and I’ve left the workforce to help her overcome this disease. Man: “oh, that’s too bad. Say, I need to go say hello to Jim over there - haven’t seen him in ages, will you excuse me. You just become irrelevant in their eyes. Women’s responses are somewhat better, but typically aligned around wanting to know more about the cancer and how Meagan is doing. Given that it (The Big “C) dominates my life right now, it’s not like I want to hide it. My letterpress business is still in it’s nascent stage (R&D, training, studio set-up) and I don’t want characterize myself as a letterpress printer yet. It’s definitely on the horizon and I am putting the time into it, so I suppose soon I can express what I do more in those terms and characterize the cabana boy activities as the sideline. But then it seems I am falling back into that trap of defining myself by what I do versus who I am. So the disappointment, if you can call it that, is that there are few men who will engage in the discussion about what it means to be a cabana boy, and all the feelings and work associated with that, including being empathetic. The women instantly gravitate to Meagan’s plight, and wanting to know about treatments and how she is coping. So the message is, being a cabana boy is largely a thankless and anonymous task (except of course for the deep appreciation and acknowledgment of my wife. So one needs to develop a coat of armor and recognize that in a society of strivers and achievers and production, there is just less value attached to caregivers and supporters, especially if you are a guy. So that’s why the Cabana Boy Union Local is an important group for solidarity. Hopefully it stays really small, we really don’t want to expand. We want our wives and partners strong and healthy. The meetings are easy to arrange, given there is just one member. There is little disagreement, and getting a quorum is no problem. And we are really good at self-reliance and self-support. The pay is lousy and we don’t have much hope for a raise. But the benefits are awesome, as is the work environment. We love our customer. So all in all, I guess the trade-off is worth it - awkwardness at parties and an irrelevance in the eyes of peer males. But happy, appreciative customers and a mission unlike no other.",tumblr

non-terminal,"I Believe We Have a Game Plan This ordeal has more plot twists than an Agatha Christie mystery. We have been mentally prepping for an in-hospital treatment of Interleukin-2 at the start of next month, under the supposition that the next scans (scheduled for the 29th of this month) will show small (hopefully) disease progression. We’d like to believe the anti-hormone treatment she’s been on would have some chance of success, but we know it’s small, so we are being somewhat realistic about what comes next. We suspected Kaplan would recommend the Interleukin 2 treatment as it is the last FDA approved treatment available, before pursuing clinical trials. In the interim, we had also thought we’d be going to the National Cancer Institute this month to have them check Meagan out and see if any of their clinical trials would be applicable. We sorta got shut down/put off because she is already undergoing treatment, and we THOUGHT she had to wait another 30 days after current treatment completion to even re-contact them. A call to our research oncology nurse today clarified quite a few things, and may have opened up some other options near-term, as well as affirmed our faith they are looking out for our best interest and that it is really important that you be your own advocate. Meagan called to confirm the next times and days for the scans and follow-up with Kaplan. Then she discussed more with him about the perceived delay with the Cancer Institute and the desire the get a second opinion before starting the Interleukin2 treatment (particularly because we know some of the clinical trials there involve Interleukin 2, after they have done something called Adoptive Cell Therapy (taken your killer T-cells out of your body, multiplied them by the billions, make sure they can target the cancer, and then re-inject them into you after a chemo treatment. Our clinical research nurse clarified the situation. After our meeting with Kaplan and review of the scan results - if there is growth - we can in fact go back to the Cancer Institute right away to get their assessment and clinical trial options. Meagan will have completed the anti-hormone treatment, we will have had a recent scan, so they can see us and assess, as long as treatment starts 30 days after the last treatment. Confusing huh? But better - our nurse will call to make the appointments and make sure the latest scan data is there, plus give us a package to take with. They will also set up an appointment with the Cancer Care Alliance doc in Seattle who is running a different melanoma clinical trial that we know she qualifies for. So hopefully after those visits and discussions with 2 other docs (melanoma specialists and their teams) and re-convening with Kaplan by mid-April, we will have some choices and at least the comfort of mind that we are looking at all the viable options. Because one of the viable options is to skip the standard Interleukin 2 treatment and go for the clinical trial that still uses Interleukin 2. It takes a while to grow the cells though, so one of the things we have to make sure of is that we have the time to make that option work (in other words the cancer isn’t growing fast. We will pre-clear some things with Kaplan in advance - like if he’d support the Cancer Institute approach first over conventional (we have hints he thinks it is a good option, and that if she qualifies and they want to take out some tumors while there, we’d go ahead, knowing we have right to caucus with Kaplan before final decision. So lessons learned. Make sure you understand your options. Don’t hesitate to talk to your doc or research nurse about questions and issues. Don’t hesitate to ask for second opinions. Clarify the process involved in clinical trials and when you are eligible to talk to them versus eligible to get treatment. If you aren’t clear after the first discussion, call them again and go over it again. It does put you on a spin cycle of emotion. In some ways you just want to know what the damn treatment is and go for it. Throwing more options in the ring causes me stress based on uncertainty and not knowing how to plan (logistics, etc. It’s just emotional too, because a life is on the line. But the benefit of course is maybe more efficacious treatment, and maybe fewer rugged treatments she would have to endure (because if she failed on the standard IL-2 she’d definitely do the clinical trial.

non-terminal,"Consistency Two thoughts about this. From a Cabana Boy perspective, especially as this thing turns into a marathon (a good thing, I find it hard(er) to maintain consistent support. I probably do in reality, but sometimes I realize that a few days have slipped by, and they are days we haven’t had to deal with anything, so as a result I’ve not had to be “on point” and constantly addressing the issues. They are certainly there, as the 8, pound elephant in the room. But aside from some chit chat first thing in the morning and a little pillow talk at night, I may not be addressing the emotional needs of my “client. Life can feel kind of normal and so one naturally falls into old patterns. So part of the learning is being proactive about checking in and making sure Meagan is feeling o.k. (as o.k. as she can) and what I need to do to help her. It takes an act of will, given that the events aren’t driving it. The other thing is just how amazing her support network of friends and family are, and how consistent they are about checking in and sending her funny things or dropping her notes and cards. The volume isn’t quite what it was, which is understandable, but it is still most impressive how people are able to maintain their support. It matters too - Meagan delights in getting that support and interaction (aside of course from her famous addiction to Facebook.",tumblr
non-terminal,"The Four Legs of the Chair These four components make up the legs of the chair on which we are sitting to get Meagan disease free. Given we have been fortunate to dodge the vicious blow of melanoma that strikes fast and hard and leaves little time, we are engaged in all of these areas. In terms of conventional treatment (and we’ll include Ipilimumab, now known as Yervoy in that category) we have just about hit all the logical ones. The one remaining treatment, Interleukin 2 is on the horizon. But it may be that we undergo a clinical trial which incorporates Interleukin 2 within the protocol, instead of a stand alone treatment. Because that treatment is really nasty, involving a multi-week hospitalization. We’d rather do it in Seattle, with our support network in place. But that would be for the stand alone treatment only, or possibly a clinical trail. More likely we’d do it at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda. Conventional treatment does not just include systemic treatments to try to rid you of the disease. A systemic treatment is like chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer that eradicates all evidence of it, at even the cell level. Even if the systemic, conventional treatments don’t work, there is the continuing option of tumor removal, until there is a breakthrough and a systemic cure is discovered. Many melanoma patients live this way, and some who have done so are now experiencing the benefits of those breakthroughs (such as with Yervoy / Ipilimumab. Given the unfortunate failure of Ipilimumab / Yervoy to work for Meagan, we are heading to the clinical trial route. There is still a lot of reason for optimism in this path. The latest direction is Adoptive Cell Therapy, extracting your own bodies T-cells (those cancer fighting cells) and multiply them by the billions and then re-infusing them into your body, along with a dose of conventional drugs like Interleukin 2. There are all sorts of variations on the theme, depending on your particular DNA makeup, and there continues to be new drug development. So as long as we can buy time, through tumor removal or partial success with the various therapies or simply slow growth, we have a great shot at beating this. Most long term survivors of melanoma, and I’m talking LONG TIME, have participated in some way in clinical trials. It doesn’t mean you are a lab rat or that you are in randomized trials (where you might not get a drug they think works. There are many Phase 1 or 2 trials (not ready for submission to the FDA for approval and not ready for broad testing) available. Sorting out which ones make sense and which ones keep you eligible for future ones in the event of lack of success is what we rely on our team for. Because melanoma is an immune system cancer, it just seems to make sense to get your body in tip top immune system shape. Meagan has already plunged into that with her change in food sources and exercise and certain supplements. Next week we visit a naturopath who is working at the intersection of conventional and alternative medicine in oncology to get her perspectives on what else we should be doing. It’s pretty clear most oncologists, even those specializing in melanoma, take a somewhat dim view of the power of foods and natural herbs and supplements to support disease control or eradication. Yet, there is plenty of evidence that certain foods and herbs exert powerful influences on your immune system. Up until now we have really lacked that integrated view of the conventional and alternative avenues, and we’d like there to be some coherence and someone looking at her holistically. But we are not so beyond the fence that we will go to the clinics Tijuana for the bizarre. Lastly, is the power of attitude. I’ve written about this before. Quality of life is really important. You don’t have to be in denial about the severity of the disease to hold positive thoughts in your head and a belief in an optimistic outcome. We say to each other (or maybe I say it more to her when she wavers, “we will prevail. Meagan is living her life right now the way she wants, surrounded by friends and family and drawing on the strength and energy of those around her. Every person faces their own mortality in different ways; after all, life is a terminal disease, it’s not a question of “if” but a question of “when. Some people, when faced with more imminent signs of possible early demise, opt for knocking off a bucket list of activities. That’s fine, but not who Meagan is or we are as a couple. For us, life is about being who we are, living where we are, surrounded by people we love and care about. Couple that with a positive attitude, and we think that will be the magic ingredient that works with all the other aspects to see us through to becoming disease free.",tumblr

non-terminal,"Meltdowns You never know what might trigger it. Meagan has done such a fantastic job being positive, energetic, optimistic and hopeful - that when it comes - it’s always a bit of a surprise and a conundrum. And a time for cabana boy to leap into action. Instinctively the best thing to do is just hug and hold her and reassure. Depending on what the trigger is though, what you say matters. We’ve had some meltdowns based on general information or news, i.e, someone we are acquainted with dying of cancer. In other cases it’s been based on reading or hearing some specific piece of news or discovery that might be related directly to her cancer. So it’s a pretty stressful time. An understatement. I usually try to reassure her with information, reminding her about the course of her particular type of cancer, the advances being made in places like the National Cancer Institute, and how the discovery of her particular mutation may lead to more productive treatment. Then I remind her of her mantras: she’s a warrior ninja princess, and she’s young, strong, healthy (except for the cancer. Then it’s on to using the metaphor developed for her about putting the fear, “the bully, back in the box, padlocking it, and putting it away. Then we try to focus on what is good about life, enjoying each and every day, taking it one step at a time and not looking down the road at “what-ifs. Reminding her to breathe and then trying to lighten things up (last night it was my imitation of the character in the movie “Hook” trying to get Peter Pan (Robin Williams) to “think happy thoughts Peter.

non-terminal,"Turkey Tail Mushrooms Went to our long awaited appointment with the oncology naturopath at Bastyr University yesterday. Adding to the anti-cancer team. Many pros and cons about this. First the cons. It seems that almost every new visit we’ve had with a doctor or oncologist or naturopath has started off on the wrong foot. Why? Because they have you fill out all this information in advance, maybe have your records sent over from your primary doc or oncologist, but when you walk in to see the doc for the first time, it is VERY clear they haven’t read it. In this case the administrative staff didn’t even have it pulled together although Meagan had faxed it last week. They said they did’t have the latest blood work, so I called over and got it sent over only to have the staff person come back and say, ‘oh, I found it anyway. It’s kind of a joke actually - if this was an interview with an attorney or accountant I’d walk away from them ASAP. They rely on their wisdom and quick ability to assess based on asking questions already answered in the damn advance questionnaires and a regular protocol they follow for standard treatment. It just shows for me how important it is for the team (cancer patient and cabana boy) to make sure the story gets told in the right way and in the right order right away so the doc can make a good assessment. In other words, you have to help them do a good job. You can’t assume they’ve read it in advance. You have to be your own advocate. The good news is that our naturopath does seem to have a wealth of knowledge and has “prescribed” some medicinal plants (one of which Meagan was already taking but in a much higher dose. One of those is Turkey Tail Mushrooms . If you click on the link above it will take you to an article about the alleged benefits. My attitude right now is that the medical world so far hasn’t found an answer so if taking something which is non-toxic and non-harmful could have a benefit - why not? I do know the major drug companies are scouring the rain forests for herbs and plants (and now fungi) for the next blockbuster drugs (which they will patent and manufacture. Potent, high profit drugs like Taxol came from the yew tree. She is also suggesting another treatment - high dose Vitamin C - but she is going to connect with our oncologist to see if he’s ok with it. I think her goal and that of Bastyr is to be more integrated with Western medicine. It will be interesting to hear Kaplan’s response.",tumblr
non-terminal,"I Read it in Oprah Yes, I do browse through Meagan’s monthly “Oprah” magazine. I’ve found some good vegetarian recipes in it and some health articles which have been helpful and corroborate information we’ve received elsewhere. In the most recent edition there is an article from a woman who has ovarian cancer which reflected our experience and the direction cancer treatment is heading. Essentially she got the standard treatment for ovarian cancer (chemo, radiation) but then started wondering why the treatment wasn’t customized to her DNA. So she started a foundation that is helping ovarian cancer patients get their genetic profile and then matching clinical trials to the various mutations they might have. This is right in line with where we’ve been heading. Standard treatments didn’t work (the standard treatments for melanoma are not particularly effective anyway) and the latest drug, Ipilimumab, is a general purpose solution, that although more effective initially for many patients, did not work for Meagan. The latest thinking around cancer is to customize the treatment based on DNA profile, not the location from whence it started. So we are heading down the clinical trial route (likely starting at the National Cancer Institute in very early April right after her scan scheduled for late March. Which clinical trial we will be eligible for will be a function of a few things - some of which we know and some of which we don’t. We do know some are based on particular mutations you have and we know for sure she has one type that they are targeting. But they also are using different mechanisms to deliver the drugs - some are vaccine based and some are infusion based. They have multiple trials running. The question is: who is going to be looking out for our best interest and say, this is the right trial for you given your history and mutations and keeping the most options open for down the road if it doesn’t work? When you look at the clinical trials there are many principle investigators and all the studies are “recruiting” volunteers. I don’t want us recruited into a trial just because they need a few more numbers in that trial - I want Meagan in a trial that is right for her. So we will be prepared to advocate on our own behalf, with some advance discussion with Dr. Kaplan in hand. I’m also going to prepare a one page summary of Meagan’s disease and treatment history to hand to each person we discuss her condition with under the theory they won’t have read her file (I know, I’m cynical. I’ll also prepare a list of questions for the Institute people when it comes to deciding which trial makes sense. I think we are long past the days when doctors were authoritarian figures and you did what they said without discussion. In our territory it’s clearly uncharted waters, they know a little, but they don’t know you that well, and it’s important that you take ownership and control of the situation. It’s not that we aren’t grateful for the opportunity or the work they are doing. It just needs to be a partnership with a balance of power and decisions based on mutual concurrence.",tumblr
non-terminal,"Ipilimumab - thoughts after treatment One of the questions people are asking on one of the melanoma discussion boards I frequent is: “does presence of side effects indicate the drug is working. I’ve been pretty clear when I’ve chosen to respond. The answer is “no. Meagan had side effects, admittedly the mild ones compared to the thrashing your body can take from Ipilimumab if it really kicks in to gear. Meagan’s side effects were pronounced, prolonged itching all over - which persists to this day - which is about 20 weeks out from initial treatment. The side effects are all related to your immune system kicking into high gear and confusing healthy cells and parts of the body for cancer cells. But that does not mean they are also kicking butt on the cancer cells. The drug could still be blind to the cancer cells. I feel like I’m throwing cold water on some of the questioners who are clearly elated they are having side effects so “it must be working. But the facts indicate otherwise.",tumblr
non-terminal,"Expectation management So we had our naturopath visit on Monday. Meagan received two new supplements to take (which I outlined in an earlier post. One of the treatments discussed was high dose, intravenous delivered Vitamin C. We got a long explanation of the curative powers of Vitamin C and how it affects cancer tumors and cells. When we left, the naturopath was going to email and contact our oncologist to get his buy-in. That was Monday about 1pm. It’s now Thursday, and we’ve heard nothing. Nothing from either part of the team. Professionally, wouldn’t you think someone would get back to you with either the information about when to come in for treatment, or that our oncologist didn’t think it was a good idea, or that they had been unable to connect but would keep trying? Especially after they had been touting the wonders of this particular treatment and setting expectations? And knowing we are likely leaving town right after the scans on the 30th and probably will be instructed to stay off all treatments and supplements until the National Cancer Institute clinical trial she participates in? The naturopath also made many statements about the alleged efficacy and speed at which the various supplements would work. Not, “might work. “Would work. How professional or smart is that? They aren’t the ones who have to deal with the emotional stress and swings if it doesn’t work. You’d think they would be a bit more circumspect to manage expectations and emotions. Such as, “if it works, here’s what to expect. If it works here is when you might see results. But it might not work. At least then you aren’t walking out high on a cloud of high expectations only to have them dashed. But they aren’t there to deal with the fall-out. That’s the cabana boy’s job. So next time health care professional - I am going to hold you to a professional standard about expectation management.",tumblr

non-terminal,"11 Tips to Get Through Chemotherapy This is one of the best articles I have read on how to get through chemotherapy and healthy ways to manage its side effects. I have posted the link above, but for anyone who is too lazy to click on it here it is… 11 Tips to Get Through Chemo By Jennifer Griffin 1. Get your teeth cleaned before you start because you can’t get them cleaned during chemo and you tend to get mouth sores. You can minimize these by brushing your teeth three to five times a day and rinsing with a mild mouthwash—I use a mild, dry toothpaste and mouthwash called Biotene (baking soda and saltwater gargles work, as well) 2. Get your wigs now—find a really cute, fun one or two and go with your girlfriends before you start losing your hair. Have fun with it—no one in Hollywood wears their own hair—they are ALL wigs! I am a redhead right now and never was before and love it. I don’t know about the drugs you are taking, but the typical chemo drugs cause your hair to fall out on day 14 to 17. Shave it off before it starts falling out —it’s much more empowering that way. Invite your girlfriends to do it with you. Plan to have lunch somewhere fun afterward. Embrace it. Bald is very powerful, but remember to get a hat —a fuzzy fleece one—because bald is also breezy and you will catch drafts that you didn’t even know existed. You need to sleep in the fuzzy hat all the time. I like to wear cute knit hats over the wigs because they look a little less wiggy and a little more young. (Let your friends throw a hat party for you—like a baby shower but with hats) 3. Get some nice body lotion and lip balm because the chemo dries out your skin. (On the flip side, chemo is better than Botox and takes all the toxins out of your skin. Suddenly, your face is as smooth as a baby’s butt) 4. Get some powder bronzer so that when your face looks pale and drawn and a little green from the drugs, you can throw on a little extra bronzer powder and blush and feel that you don’t “look like a cancer patient” There is a reason the American Cancer Society has what is called the “Look Good, Feel Better” campaign, because if you get up each morning and shower and put on your blush and your wig, you literally feel better. It is so easy to start the downward spiral into feeling sorry for yourself. There’s a great title of a book: Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy . My husband, Greg, once asked me why I was getting so dolled up. “After all” he said, “we were just going to chemo” I told him that was exactly why I was putting on lipstick and a bright scarf and great earrings. It’s your body armor. Don’t go out without it. Every time I have, I have regretted it. 5. Get some clothes that are your “chemo uniform” I went to Max Mara and got comfy leggings, long, cozy, sleek sweaters, furry boots (like Uggs—cashmere everything. Anything to make you feel cozy and sporty. All easy to throw on so you just reach in your closet and grab your uniform—taking all the stress out of what to wear. 6. Immediately order from Amazon two cookbooks by Rebecca Katz (a San Francisco chef, The Cancer Fighting Kitchen and One Bite at a Time. Tell your friends about them so they can cook healthy things for you that help with the chemo side effects and not bring you doughnuts and cakes to make you feel better. I remember at the first group session at my hospital, the women were all going around introducing themselves and consistently they talked about having gained weight through chemo. One woman said she had gained 70 pounds. The drugs and the steroids can cause havoc to your metabolism, so it’s best to try to find a reasonable but pretty strict eating regime to give your body and immune system the strength it needs to fight and bounce back. Your mouth will feel like Chernobyl pretty quickly and your taste buds die, so there are tricks in Rebecca Katz’s books to make food still taste appealing and to stimulate your appetite so you can stay strong. Certain foods definitely boost your immune system. 7. I immediately eliminated all processed foods, all white sugar and nearly all dairy. Triple negative responds well to a very lowfat diet. To be a vegan is ideal, but you will find that when you get anemic during the chemo, you may have to bend the rules a bit on meat—at least that is what I have found and was tucking into some veal shank for the marrow at midnight last night. Also, a low-glycemic diet is very good for triple negative because there is some research that shows that triple negative may have something to do with insulin levels. 8. I drink only water, bubbly water and green tea (I don’t want the sugars in the other drinks. I put lemon in and on everything—it cuts through the chemical taste and you need 3 quarts of water a day to wash the chemicals through your system. Staying hydrated also keeps you from being nauseated. They recommend three to six mugs of green tea a day to get maximum benefit from the antioxidants in the tea. Start eating all organic. Check out Jane Plant (British geologist’s book) on how she survived breast cancer by giving up dairy. 9. Don’t touch any milk, eggs or meat that have any hormones in them. I still eat eggs and fish— but only wild-caught fish, like salmon and white fish. I don’t want the swordfish and other things that are higher up the food chain because they have a lot of mercury. 10. Eat a lot of cabbage. Cancer hates cabbage! When you are eating this clean, detoxed diet filled with superfoods, you are going to be as strong as you can be to counter the tsunami-like effects of the weekly, biweekly or tri-weekly chemo treatments. It’s like girding yourself to take each wave head-on—like body surfing. And even those days when you don’t feel great, go out for a walk. Don’t miss your exercise—the oxygen and endorphins will help so so much. And eat like a pregnant woman overcoming morning sickness—small meals five times a day. Don’t let your stomach get empty; it helps counter the nausea. Sleep with a banana by the side of your bed and a pitcher of water. Hydrate all night long and have the banana in case you are feeling a little queasy first thing in the morning. Demand that your doctor give you a wonder drug called Emend—best anti-nausea drug on the market. Insist on it. Look into getting chia seeds from your health food store or online. They are flax on steroids. They are wonderful on your oatmeal in the morning and have all the omega-3s you need, plus fiber and calcium. 11. Ginger is the best natural anti-nausea food. Chop fresh ginger into everything. Eat it raw. Make tea from it. It got so desperate the other day I went straight from the gym to a nearby sushi restaurant to eat a mound of pickled ginger because it was the only thing I could think of to settle my stomach.

This one is a little darker, fam. Years ago, I sat down in an office with a doctor who wrote on the back of test results I didn’t understand with the word “CANCER” in all caps. She proceeded to show me the stages and tell me which one I was in. A few days before Halloween in - cervical cancer, stage 2. I have never felt so tired in my life. I have never felt so helpless because it was something I couldn’t control. I have never felt so lonely because I didn’t know anybody who had it this young (I was diagnosed before I turned 30. I have never felt so frustrated (I was mentally done and everybody was breathing down my neck with questions, harping on me on how I should beat it, and harping on me for the simpliest of things - like staying up late. I have never felt so “this is my life now - everything else is out the door” because my main goal was to beat it. I had dreams. I had things I wanted to accomplish. I had places I wanted to visit. I had life goals. I cried for a solid 3 days before I could even pick myself up, take the medicine that I was told was going to make me sick. I thought it was a bad dream, as cliche as that might sound. I didn’t want to do it. As simple as that… I didn’t want to do it. But I had to. And I fucking did it. I lost a lot of my hair, my skin had hives, I was paler than I’ve ever been, I lost a lot of weight and gained it back quickly (it fluctuated out of this world, and I just couldn’t look at myself in the mirror. I bought wigs. I relied on eyelash extensions so I could feel normal. I cut my hair short so it didn’t look like I had a mullet. I airbrushed my skin a few times just so I could have pretty arms and legs until I took a shower. I lived in hoodies because of how forgiving they are, no matter what weight my body wanted to be at that week. I watched my money go $ at a time. I discovered chemotherapy was a heartless, but logical bitch. I couldn’t make myself feel beautiful, no matter how hard I tried - I felt ran over and thought I looked dehydrated and used up. I didn’t want to do it. I wanted it over with. But I fucking did it. I am STILL recovering from it all. It’s hard to see pictures of yourself before and see how much a thing like cancer took from you. A bastard like cancer. People will tell you “you are so beautiful, but it’s a process. To have long hair again? That would be the dream. To know for a fact that I’ll never have to go through it again? That would be the dream. To have a place on my own, despite the medical bills and the setback it put me at? That would be the dream. A damn dream. A dream I thought that would never happen many times while I took those godawful pills. But here we are. A new place. I can breathe here. I can decorate how I want to and look at every single piece that’s in my house and smile, saying “heh - remember when you thought the only room you’d get at one point was a hospital bed? Look” Yes, the fear of cancer coming back is always in the back of my mind. But right now… I can breathe here. I am proud of myself. If anybody is the most supportive and proud of myself… it’s me. I’ve always got me, I can be self-efficient. In the words of Lizzo and her song Soulmate, “I’m my own soulmate. I know that I’m always gonna hold me down” And that’s been proven time and time again. I’ve been told by a man that I would never have my own, that I was worthless. And he beat the shit out of me. And I had cancer tell me the same, also suffocating me. But I have proved those words to be false, even if my brain might want to say otherwise sometimes. I just want to look them both in the eye one day and say… “But I fucking did it”",tumblr

I definitely bought it because it had avocados in it (why am I like this, but she more than that. Saturday Skin’s toner?

And it just makes my face smell amazing and feel incredible. Apostrophe? This guy is new actually. And I was suggested to use The Ordinary with it.

non-terminal,"A New Beginning hoechemo : A New Beginning - Dedicated to Caregivers Written by Aura Brickler in response to a journal prompt on April 13, My new beginning has yet to happen. I don’t know much about it, but I know it will come with a bang. I know it will hurt like hell even though I have braced myself for years. Some days it feels like I sit and wait for it, daydreaming about what it will feel like. It can show up like a slow motion video of a head on collision; as a family comes into focus I realize it is ours. Other times it looks like a storm way off in the distance; a disastrous cloud over an Idaho mountain range, while we’re being spared a few last rays of the sun’s light. When it happens I will scream and cry and whisper to myself, “but you had so much time to prepare” I will begin again in a suffocating state of mourning. I will smile at others and assure them that I am okay. I will agree that he’s better off not suffering, that he is no longer laboring to find each and every single breath. I will hope with all of my might that there is an afterlife, one that has offered him eternal peace after so much pain. I will begin again wanting more than ever to believe in the narrative of heaven because what else do you tell your young child about where her father goes when his body dies? I will likely tell her that he lives among the stars now, always hovering over her, and when the night sky is the darkest, she’ll see him the most. I will begin again as someone with a lot of regrets. The idea of living every day as if it is the last fades after days of trying hard to do so. Cancer has a way of digging in and dragging along. It grabs you by your weaknesses and makes you beg for an ounce of strength. It gnaws at the foundation of your collective hopes and dreams, allowing despair to fill in the cracks. I will begin again and learn how to forgive. I will begin again as a narrator, telling stories to keep him close to us. Telling tall tales that protect our daughter from the parts of the story that are too painful. I imagine being left in a fog of uncertainty, fear, and confusion. When the fog begins to lift, I will begin again as grateful - for what we had and what, of him, I still have. I will begin each day like I do now, with a cup of coffee. I will begin again as a widow. In loving memory of my husband, Bret Hoekema, who traded suffering for surrender on January 6th, . He left us too soon but his presence carries on with such tenacity that he will never be just a memory. I cannot imagine the pain of this loss. That’s not quite true. I absolutely can imagine it which is why it hits me so hard. I’ve had friends who have lost partners and I’ve lost dear friends. Cancer has a way of digging in and dragging along. It grabs you by your weaknesses and makes you beg for an ounce of strength. It gnaws at the foundation of your collective hopes and dreams, allowing despair to fill in the cracks. God I hate this disease. I live mostly now in the land of remission. My diagnosis and treatment a not so distant memory. I am constantly aware of it in my rear view mirror. I’m aware of how lucky we were and still are to still be here.

I suggest we use ‘moderator’ as a gender neutral version of mom/dad Admin and op would work makes them sound powerful and in charge of everything Admin (respectful) Op (derogatory) i was going to add something else to this but instead i got to thinking and i was like huh. what could you use. in most languages the word for ‘mother’ usually starts with an M, because phonetically is one of the easiest sounds for a newborn to make when they start babbling, and mothers tend to be the one most around the child. so in my mind that crosses M off the list, because it’s automatically associated with a feminine figure similarly, ‘father’ tends to start with D, T, P, or B. (phonetically these sounds are very close together; and are all only different because of being voiced or unvoiced) these are also phonetically easy letters and ones kids pick up on earlier. now the hard sounds for kids are the following: or in normal speak: the English R, the “j” or “dge” sound in “judge” the “th” sound in “thigh” and the “th” sound in “the” and we don’t want kids unable to say their parent’s name for years, so those are also off the list. additionally, it’s easiest for young kids to just repeat the same sound twice rather than figuring out the tongue gymnastics of putting different sounds together, which is why kids will say Ma-Ma or Da-Da and not Ma-Mo or Da-Po. and we’ll want to stick with low back vowels like “ah” and avoid ones like the hard “i” or “ee” so what does that leave us? when we want a sound kids can learn easily and early but don’t want to just put a funky spin on “mama” or “dada? my suggestions: G, K, W, L. i personally lean towards W and L. they’re called liquids, since they’re the consonants that kind of aren’t consonants, and kids (and ESL learners) will tend to swap out the English R for a W or L until they can learn the R. if i ever have a child, they’ll start calling me Wawa. then when they get older, they’ll call me Wala, or maybe even Wally. and then, once they’re finally phonetically developed, they can call me by my true title as their nonbinary guardian for their 18+ years: Waluigi. Okay, but on an actually serious note, Baba is used in several different languages, but the meaning changes between mother, father, or grandparent. However, it is not used in English afaik, so it could be a good English option. baba is what I use as a nonbinary parent (it has a long history for butches) and this post hit me like a two-by-four to the back of the goddamn HEAD How about Tata, because no matter what, they’re gonna try to latch onto a nipple wait wait wait, do babies try to latch on to the nipples of non-lactating parents too? is this a thing? do babies just automatically zero in on any nipple in the vicinity, regardless of the presence of breasts or breast milk? is this an experience cis men deal with I need to KNOW UPDATE: based on the notes the answer is a resounding YES! I can’t speak to cis men’s experience, but my house has this kind of lamp, and my progeny were both very fascinated by it whenever I would carry them under one of them.

I have an identical twin. We’re both tall, androgynous, and have naturally deep voices In high school a rumor was spread that one of us was trans. For years, everyone in school had convinced themselves that my twin was “the trans one. She rolled with it to keep me safe, and said it felt like a compliment to be mistaken for a trans woman since she looked up to a lot of trans women. That didn’t stop the bullying, but it’s easier to deal with when it’s directed at the wrong person. I’m engaged to a feminine cis guy who is several inches shorter than me. I have lbs on him and I can dead lift him. He’s more delicate and soft both physically and socially. He cries during sad movies, owns half a million stuffed animals, and clings to my arm when he’s nervous or it’s cold out (oh yeah, also he’s adorable) Whenever the topic of being trans comes up, cis people tend to think he’s the one who is trans. Direct all “what do your parents think” comments onto him. Completely ignore me. Ask him invasive/transphobic questions about his body. Tell him “you pass so well” through grit teeth. Like with my sister, I get pretty pissed about this, but there’s not much I can do about it. I have had to argue with cis people to establish the fact I’m trans because they don’t believe me & think I’m joking. they’re like “but he’s - no, she’s trans” and frantically point fingers at my fiance and sister. Because there’s no way an adult cis woman could be taller than 5′9 and choose to be bare-faced, and an adult cis man could love How To Train Your Dragon 2 with a fiery passion, enough to watch it 3 times in the theatre.

Now, because I am the way I am, it had been a while since I’d rode the fuck truck to pound town. Many moons, a hot minute.years. It had been YEARS. So ya girl gets on a few dating apps, starts to swiping and decides to see where it goes. Things did not go well at first. Which it was my own fault for having my hopes up. They were dating apps. Full of men. After a bit, I finally basically gave up and decided “bitch, we gonna fuck the next motherfucker that messages us and doesn’t give off Hannibal Lecter vibes” Here’s where the savior (or not, he destroyed me and saved me at the same time) shows up. Let’s call him Dick. Now, Dick seemed chill when chatting on the dating app so I slid him the digits. He was still chill when texting. Dick kept saying he had a big package but most dudes say that. Let’s reserve judgement for in person. Even pics can be faked with the right angle. So we set up a date and time to meet for coffee and see how it went. If the vibes were good, then we were gonna go get our fuck on. Coffee went well, so we’re off to the Dickdown Races. It started off okay. He went downtown and it honestly wasn’t all that great. I’ve had better, but I’ve had way worse. He got home girl wet, but it was mostly his own slobber. Then he whips it out. Y’all…Dick wasn’t lying. He was big. Huge. Massive. Like right out of a porno. I was TERRIFIED. I had never had a dick that big and how the fuck did he think it was gonna fit! Heads up…it didn’t. Ya girl got torn. It was bad. There was so much blood it looked like a fucking murder scene. I expected fuckin Criminal Minds or CSI to bust in any minute and start looking for a dead body. It was so bad ol Dick stopped and asked if I was okay. I. Was. Not. I have never left a place so quick. I left $40 on the dresser for new sheets and fucking booked it out that bitch. On my way home I pulled over and furiously googled “torn vagina from big ol dick” to see how long I had left to live. I wasn’t ready to die. I didn’t even have a fucking will (still don’t. The great and wonderful google told me it was normal and should stop in a few hours/days. It didn’t. The bleeding got less and less but was still there. Out of fear for my pussy, I scheduled a GYNO appt and hoped they wouldn’t have to stitch my kitty. The doc takes one look and said “Okay, so Madonna, if you don’t use it then you lose it. She tightened up from not getting laid. Next time you want to like a virgin, use lube” Those are exact words. They are burned into my brain. God bless that doctor. She’s hella chill. She also told me “there’s not a damn thing wrong with getting some strange and hooking up with weirdos from the internet but make sure to use protection. Those same weirdos that give good dick can also give bad STDs” During the exam, she did notice (or feel? Idk) something off so she scheduled an ultrasound the following week. An intravagainal ultrasound. So there I was, getting this wand shoved up and wiggled around in my poor, abused kitty. A mass was found. The doctor scheduled a biopsy 2 weeks later. Fun fact, uterine biopsy’s fucking hurt. You get zero meds, just a tube shoved through the hole in your cervix, a grippy tool put in the tube and a small chunk of your uterus lining ripped the fuck out. I almost kicked my doc in the face. The results came back a few weeks later. It was a precancerous mass. A D&C was scheduled. The results from that showed more precancerous cells than previously thought. A hysterectomy was done June . The after surgery pathology found stage 1 uterine cancer. I’m considered in remission & see a cancer doc every 3 months to make sure it hasn’t come back. That’s how a big dick saved my life. I haven’t had sex since then. Mark me down as scared and not horny when it comes to dick. Even fake dick. 😂",tumblr

non-terminal,"Lilly's Tirzepatide Slowed Kidney Function Decline in High Risk Diabetics with Heart Disease MedicalResearch.com Interview with: Prof. Heerspink prof. dr. H.J. (Hiddo) Lambers Heerspink Clinical Pharmacologist Department Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology University Medical Center Groningen Groningen MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: Tirzepatide is a novel GIP-GLP1 receptor agonist recently FDA approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The SURPASS_4 trial demonstrated that in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk tirzepatide compared to insulin glargine markedly reduces Hba1c and body weight. About 1 out of 3 patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease has kidney disease and these patients are at high risk of kidney failure. The aim of this study was to assess whether tirzepatide could slow CKD progression in high risk individuals with type 2 diabetes participating in the SURPASS 4 trial. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: The main findings were that tirzepatide indeed significantly reduced albuminuria (a strong renal and cardiovascular risk marker, reduced eGFR decline compared to insulin glargine and reduced the risk of a composite kidney endpoint of new-onset macroalbuminuria, 40% eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease and renal death. These data suggest that tirzepatide may confer kidney protection and support future trials to provide more definitive evidence. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: The main message from this study is that a novel GIP-GLP-1RA does not only reduce HbA1c and body weight but also slows the decline in kidney function in high risk patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease. Readers should realize that these data are generated as part of an exploratory analysis and can not yet be interpreted as definitive evidence but they support additional research to confirm the kidney protective effects of tirzepatide. MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work? Response: A large dedicated renal outcome trial should be conducted My disclosures are that I am a consultant to Eli-Lilly Citation: American Diabetes Associations Meeting Source Reference: Heerspink HL, et al “Effects of tirzepatide vs. insulin glargine U/mL on kidney outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes in SURPASS-4” ADA ; Abstract 17-OR.

non-terminal,"Low Incidence of CTE Found Among US Service Members MedicalResearch.com Interview with: Daniel Perl MD Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Professor of Pathology at USUHS and Director of the CNRM’s Brain Tissue Repository Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Bethesda, Maryland MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a brain disorder that is predominantly seen in individuals who have suffered from repeated impact head trauma, such as occurs in former boxers or American football players. CTE has very specific alterations in the brain and can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Some have claimed that, in addition to former contact sport participants, individuals who served in the military and were repeatedly exposed to blast (explosions) are also at increased risk for developing CTE. However, this claim has been based on a rather small number of anecdotal cases. The DoD/USU Brain Tissue Repository is the only facility in the world that is exclusively dedicated to the collection and study of donated brain specimens derived from deceased active duty and retired service members. We used the resources of this facility to examine consecutively collected brain specimens for the presence of CTE. This would to provide a view of how common CTE was in this setting and, when diagnosed, was the disease correlated with prior blast exposure, participation in contact sports and other forms of head trauma, and with certain forms of symptomatology such as development of PTSD, alcohol/substance abuse, death by suicide, etc. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: Of the brains examined from military personnel, we found only 10 specimens which showed neuropathologic features diagnostic of CTE and of those identified cases, involvement of the brain by the disease tended to be rather minimal (e.g. half showed only one CTE-related lesion, despite extensive sampling. All of the identified cases diagnosed with CTE had a history of participation in contact sports in addition to their having served in the military. It would appear from our data that CTE is uncommon among military personnel and that exposure to repeated blast does not represent a substantial risk factor for the development of the disease. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: That chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is rather rare in US service members and when seen, it tends to be rather mild in terms of brain involvement and it is typically associated with prior participation in contact sports, especially football. If we could find only 10 cases of CTE among brain specimens examined, in a young active mostly male population, this suggests that this disease is not as common as is frequently claimed in the general civilian active male population. While we could not claim that the cohort studied reflects the makeup of the general civilian population (or the military, for that matter, if in this group of mostly male active and relatively young individuals who are those who sign up to serve in the military, we could only document a diagnosis of the disease in 4.4% (and remember, half of the cases had very minimal involvement of the brain – only one CTE-related lesion could be documented in the brain samples, then we believe this says something about overall risks in people who never played contact sports professionally. Additionally, our data indicate that CTE was not a significant contributor to prominent sequelae commonly seen in service members, such as PTSD, alcohol/drug abuse or suicide. MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work? Response: We need to continue the collection and study of additional donated brain specimens that are derived from both symptomatic and non-symptomatic service members in order to better understand the effects of a military career on brain health (our DoD/USU Brain Tissue Repository’s overall mission. MedicalResearch.com: Is there anything else you would like to add? Response: Yes, most of the individuals studied in this reports who were most heavily exposed to combat (especially blast-exposed) died at a relatively young age. Studies of CTE in contact sport athletes show that there is a considerable period of latency between when they are exposed to head trauma during their athletic careers and when they become symptomatic with the disease. This period of latency can be several decades in duration. There are many examples of former NFL players who had successful business careers, success in sports casting, etc. for extended period of time before finally becoming symptomatic with CTE later in life. We can only report our data on the cases we have available to examine. In coming years we may identify additional cases of CTE in former service members who served in the 20 year period of the War on Terror ( to ) and who were so extensively exposed to blast. Only time and further studies will tell. We have no financial disclosures to report. Citation: Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in the Brains of Military Personnel David S.

non-terminal,"African American Women Face Increased Odds of Dying from Metastatic Breast Cancer MedicalResearch.com Interview with: Dr. Singhal Sachi Singhal, MD Department of Medicine Crozer Chester Medical Center Upland, PA MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? What are the main findings? Response : This study focuses on analysing the National Inpatient Sample for patients with breast cancer, their breakdown by race, gender and US regions, and their mortality per sub-group. The main findings are that African Americans, especially AA women are at significantly increased odds of dying from metastatic breast cancer in the United States. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response : Identifying racial disparities in breast cancer is step one of bringing change. It exists in all fronts- diagnosis, management, mortality. We aim to shed light on existing racial disparities so we as a global oncological community can plan the steps to improve equitable health care for each subset of the population - better access to primary care, mammograms, better representation at clinical trials, access to early management and more universal insurance are some ways we can improve from different angles. MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work? Response : This is an epidemiological paper demonstrating breakdown of metastatic breast cancer by race, gender and regions. Future steps in research could be further stratifying data based on ER/PR positivity and analysing respective outcomes, interventional studies that could potentially analyse change in mortality with interventions in place, etc. Any disclosures? We have no funding or other disclosures to add. Citation: ASCO abstract Racial and regional disparities in metastatic breast cancer.

non-terminal,"Rural Cancer Survival Trails Urban Patients, Especially for Minorities MedicalResearch.com Interview with: Dr. Lewis-Thames Marquita W. Lewis-Thames, PhD (she/her/Dr) Assistant Professor, Department of Medical Social Science Center for Community Health, Member Researcher Assistant Directors of Community Outreach and Engagement, Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? What are the main findings? Response: Incidence, mortality, and survivorship provide a comprehensive description of cancer for a group of people. Differences in cancer incidence and mortality trends by rural-urban status and race and ethnicity are well documented, but urban-rural cancer survivorship trends by race and ethnicity are unknown. To this end, we examined almost 40 years of racial and ethnic differences by rural-urban status for 5-year survival of patients with lung, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers. Using a nationwide epidemiological assessment of data from the SEER database, we found that 5-year cancer-specific survival trends increased for all cancer types and race and ethnic groups, regardless of rural or urban status. Generally, rural, and non-Hispanic Black cancer patients had worse survival outcomes than others. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: Our study provides a comprehensive analysis to show that rural patients’ survival has trailed urban patients’ survival for almost 40 years, regardless of sociodemographic and clinical variables. This study illuminates that for almost 40 years (and likely more than that) cancer survivorship inequities for rural and non-Hispanic Black cancer patients persistent, and they are chronically among the most cancer burdened in the United States. MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work? Response: As it relates to the future of cancer research, our findings are partly explained by systematic and structural inequities that have created barriers for many cancer patients from rural and minoritized groups to access cancer screenings and advanced treatments. This study provides poignant evidence that targeted cancer education and programming, as well as additional funding and services, are long overdue for rural and minoritized groups. Therefore, patients need services and interventions at the time of screening and treatment before they are identified as cancer survivors. Citation: Lewis-Thames MW, Langston ME, Khan S, et al.

non-terminal,"Lupus Awareness Month: Award Winners Will Improve Diversity in Clinical Trial Landscape Dr. Bacalao Dr. Maria Bacalao, MD Assistant Professor Department of Internal Medicine UT Southwestern Medical Center Dr. Williams Dr. Jessica Williams, MD, MPH Assistant Professor of Medicine Division of Rheumatology Emory University School of Medicine As winners of the The Robert A. Winn Diversity in Clinical Trials Award Program , Drs. Bacalao and Williams discuss the challenges of diagnosing, treating and research into the autoimmune disorder of Lupus. MedicalResearch.com: Would you briefly explain what is meant by lupus? Are there different types, i.e, SLE, discoid lupus, drug-induced etc? Dr. Bacalao : Lupus is a systemic autoimmune condition in which patients make antibodies against their own genetic materials, leading to tissue damage in various organ systems. There are several kinds. - Systemic lupus erythematosus: a condition in which the immune system affects various organs such as the skin, lungs, kidneys, bone marrow, nervous system. - Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus: Lupus that is limited to the skin but does not affect other organs​ - Drug induced lupus: drug induced lupus is similar to systemic lupus, but it is a reaction to a particular drug​ - Neonatal Lupus: a rare condition in which the antibodies from a mother with lupus affect the fetus, leading to the baby developing transient symptoms of lupus. Dr. Williams : Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1.5 million people in the United States. In lupus, the immune system develops antibodies against the body’s own tissues, leading to inflammation that can affect multiple organ systems. There are four major types of lupus including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, cutaneous lupus, drug-induced lupus, and neonatal lupus. SLE is the most common type of lupus and can affect any organ system. Cutaneous lupus is limited to the skin and includes discoid lupus, which can lead to scarring. Drug-induced lupus is caused by certain prescription drugs such as hydralazine, a blood pressure medication. Neonatal lupus is rare and may affect infants of women who have lupus. MedicalResearch.com: How is lupus diagnosed and what are the common clinical presentations? Dr. Bacalao : The diagnosis of lupus is complex and there is no laboratory test that conclusively diagnoses the condition. Rheumatologists usually use blood tests, physical exam, and X-ray results to diagnose lupus​ Rheumatologists look for: - Rashes in sun-exposed areas of skin (such as a malar or “butterfly” rash​ - Joint tenderness and swelling​ - Ulcers in mouth or nose​ - Positive antibodies such as the ANA, Smith and DS DNA blood test​ - Blood and protein in the urine​ - Hair thinning​ - Low white blood cell counts​ - Symptoms of heart and lung inflammation like chest pain or shortness of breath​ - Other symptoms concerning of Lupus like fatigue and unexplained fever​ - Unexplained neurological symptoms like seizures, confusion, strokes Dr. Williams : Lupus is diagnosed through a combination of historical and present symptoms, physical examination findings (such as rashes or joint inflammation, laboratory tests (including autoantibodies, and imaging tests (such as a chest x-ray. There is no single test that can diagnose lupus. Common symptoms of lupus include fatigue, fevers, rashes (especially a butterfly rash on the face or a rash after sun exposure, pain or swelling in the joints, hair loss, sores in the mouth or nose, and chest pain when taking a deep breath. Lupus may also present with low blood counts, kidney disease, or central nervous system disease. MedicalResearch.com: Does the clinical presentation and course differ among racial/ethnic/gender groups? Dr. Bacalao : Black Lupus Patients are over twice more likely to develop kidney disease and over times more likely to develop end stage renal disease than non-Hispanic White patients. This has not changed in a decade. - Asian patients have the highest lupus nephritis prevalence ​ - Black patients are also diagnosed on average 14 years earlier than White patients​ - Indigenous patients had a life expectancy of 50 years, vs 64 years for white patients Dr. Williams : Lupus is more common in women of childbearing age (90% of cases) and non-white patients (two-thirds of cases. Non-white patients and males have more severe disease and worse outcomes. MedicalResearch.com: Is there a familial predisposition? Dr. Williams : Yes. Lupus is more common in patients who have a family history of lupus or another autoimmune disease. If a twin develops lupus, there is a 30% chance that their identical twin will also develop lupus and a % chance that their fraternal twin will develop lupus. MedicalResearch.com: Are there public health disparities that limit access to health care for black women, particularly those of limited financial means? Dr. Bacalao : Yes, there are factors that lead to decreased access to healthcare for Black women and other women of Color. Institutional racism, such as food deserts, lack of societal neighborhood investment, also represent significant psychosocial stressors for many BIPOC patients with Lupus. ​Neighborhood poverty was also linked with increased damage accrual and mortality, which improved when patients exited poverty. All of these factors cause decreased access to healthcare. Dr. Williams : Yes, the lack of universal access to healthcare in the United States disproportionately impacts Black women, who are more likely to be of lower socioeconomic status and thus uninsured or underinsured. MedicalResearch.com: Is there adequate representation of black women in research studies? Dr. Bacalao : The belimumab clinical trial participants were only 14 percent African American and 20 percent Latino. However, the majority of Latino participants were from Latin America (around 80. In the general population of patients with Lupus, 40% are African American, 38% Non-Hispanic White, 15% Latino, 4% Asian. Dr. Williams : Black patients are significantly underrepresented in lupus clinical trials. For example, Black patients comprise 43% of prevalent cases of lupus but only 14% of lupus clinical trial participants. MedicalResearch.com: Is there hesitancy to participate in clinical trials among some individuals and ethnic groups? Dr. Bacalao : Yes, there is some hesitancy from minority groups but, when given the chance, participation among African Americans and Latinos is actually significant. Dr. Williams : Yes. Due to historical injustices in medical research such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study as well as ongoing structural racism and bias in the United States healthcare system, some non-white patients are hesitant to participate in clinical research due to fear of experiencing harm. MedicalResearch.com: What is the mission of the DCTCDP? Dr. Bacalao : The Robert A. Winn Career Development Award (Winn CDA) is a 2-year program designed to support the career development of early-stage investigator (as defined by NIH) physicians underrepresented in medicine, and physicians who have a demonstrated commitment to increasing diversity in clinical research, to become independent clinical trial investigators who are engaged in advancing health equity through their research and mentoring. Dr. Williams : The mission of the DCTCDP is to increase diversity in cancer, cardiovascular, and immunologic clinical trials to achieve equitable representation, ensure that all patients have access to innovative treatments, and confirm that new treatments are safe in all groups. The DCTCDP also aims to train early-career clinical trialists to conduct trials with a focus on community engagement and health equity. MedicalResearch.com: How do you hope to increase diversity in clinical studies and improve access to health care for underrepresented communities? Dr. Bacalao : I am currently working on an educational curriculum to help increase diversity in clinical trials. Dr. Williams : I am currently enrolling patients in lupus clinical trials at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, which is a safety-net hospital that serves > predominantly Black patients with lupus. Many of the patients at our site are uninsured or underinsured, and the availability of clinical trials significantly enhances the treatment options for the patient population that I serve. I am also studying clinical trial perceptions and barriers among the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) Cohort, a population-based cohort of > predominantly Black patients with validated lupus. These findings will be used to propose interventions to increase Black patient participation in lupus clinical trials. ­ Dr. Williams : I would like to thank the DCTCDP for providing me with the necessary training and support to become a leader in equitable lupus clinical trials. I am also grateful for my wonderful patients that teach me so much every day, and I hope that one day soon we will have a cure for lupus! Background on Female American Physicians in The Robert A. Winn Diversity in Clinical Trials Award Program - Dr. Maria Bacalao: Dr. Bacalao is a physician who was born and raised in Venezuela and came to the U.S. at 13 years old. Through the DCTCDP program, she hopes her clinical research will help to develop new therapeutic modalities for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE. Dr. Bacalao has shared that it is particularly difficult to treat lupus since it mostly affects women and women of color and current treatments/trials do not necessarily take this into account. Dr. Bacalao hopes to change misconceptions around clinical trials and help address barriers, including education and communication. Additionally, Maria is part of a nonprofit called Literacy of Chiefs, which helps empower and reduce the language barrier immigrants face. - Dr. Jessica Williams: Being Afro-Latin, Dr. Jessica finds a social justice element in her clinical research surrounding lupus, which is more prevalent in women and severe in patients of color. Currently, her trials through the DCTCDP program consist of two components - a Phase II study of a monoclonal antibody and an annual survey on patient perceptions of clinical trials through the GOAL coalition. Additionally, she is working on the best way to set up a clinical trial at her site and later create a protocol for other under-resourced areas to do the same.

non-terminal,"NEJM: Trial of IV Vitamin C for Septic ICU Patients MedicalResearch.com Interview with: François Lamontagne MD MSc (pharmacology) MSc (CEB) Professor of Medicine at the Université de Sherbrooke Endowed research chair on patient-centred research Dr. Neill Adhikari MDCM, M.Sc. Sunnybrook Research Institute and University of Toronto Toronto, Canada MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: The use of intravenous vitamin C for sepsis has been a hot topic for a few years. It was biologically plausible that vitamin C could reduce organ injury and death by scavenging reactive oxygen species and modulating the immune response to sepsis. It also seemed like an intervention that would be reasonably easy to administer globally should it prove beneficial. On the other hand, no intervention is benign and every aspect of health care should be rigorously studied. Regarding vitamin C, there were strongly held opinions in both camps and this motivated us to design and conduct the LOVIT trial. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: The main findings were that in adults with sepsis who were receiving vasopressor therapy in the ICU, the receipt of intravenous vitamin C resulted in a higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days than the receipt of placebo. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: The surest and fastest route to helping patients is via highly rigorous research. In the face of uncertainty, strongly held opinions by clinicians is a real deterrent to optimal care. Research and health care should not exist in separate silos. The seamless integration of research activities in routine health care should be a priority for all health systems in order to facilitate the conduct of efficient and impactful studies. MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work? Response: There have been more than patients enrolled in small inconclusive trials of vitamin C. Uncertainty and wasted research resources and opportunities similarly affect a very large number of routine interventions across all areas in health care. Collectively, we know how to design and conduct studies that would immediately improve patient care and outcomes. What we lack is coordination, collaboration and broader stakeholder engagement. When those ingredients are present, large trials can be completed rapidly. And, though there is a cost, good research is almost always cost-efficient, when compared to ’no research. MedicalResearch.com: Is there anything else you would like to add? Response: We are also leading ongoing RCTs of vitamin C for COVID (the LOVIT-COVID trial and the vitamin C domain of the REMAP-CAP Platform trial. More than patients have been enrolled in these trials, which are monitored by two distinct Data Safety and Monitoring Boards who have recommended that the trials continue. When the results of those trials become available, we may learn whether or not this intervention has a different effect in sepsis caused by the specific viral pathogen SARS-CoV2.

MedicalResearch.com Interview with: Dr. Chemaitelly Hiam Souheil Chemaitelly Ph.D. Assistant Professor of Research in Population Health Sciences Population Health Sciences Weill Cornell Medical College MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: The Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants resulted in a large wave of infections. The level of protection provided by prior infection or vaccination with Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines or a combination of both against infection with Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants was unknown. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: The study showed that prior infection combined with three doses of mRNA vaccination was strongly protective against symptomatic Omicron infection and against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19. Meanwhile, two dose vaccination alone was not associated with significant protection against symptomatic infection. Booster vaccination provided only 60% protection against infection but waned rapidly thereafter. However, vaccination was associated with >70% protection against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection alone was associated with 50% protection against symptomatic Omicron infection, and did not appear to wane even a year after infection. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: Vaccination provides protection against COVID-19 severity and enhances protection for those with prior infection against reinfection with new variants. MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work? Response: The study findings highlight the importance of better understanding the rapid waning in vaccine-induced immunity in contrast to natural immunity and to develop coronavirus vaccines that are broadly protective against different variants with long-lasting protection.

Response: NYC experienced a halt on all elective care from March 22 to June 8, , provoking reduced cancer screening rates, and delayed cancer care and treatment. We wanted to quantify the effect of the “pause” on cancer stage at diagnosis using lung cancer as an example of a condition where early diagnosis can dramatically modify survival. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: The analysis of Mount Sinai cancer registry showed a sharp drop in the number of diagnoses during the “pause. In addition, the diagnoses of early stage lung cancer decreased significantly in comparison to the same period in pre-pandemic years. Early stage diagnoses dropped again, while late stage diagnoses increased in February , when a new wave of COVID-19 infections ravaged the city MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: There was an immediate negative impact on lung cancer diagnoses of COVID-19 restrictions, with a sharp decrease in early stage diagnoses when a “pause” on elective procedures was introduced in , as well as when COVID-19 cases sharply increased during the Winter of . The increase in late stage diagnoses during pandemic surges may reflect the fact that only sick patients with symptoms, and acute events that require immediate care were seeking hospital attention. MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work?

Chan School Of Public Health Associate Physician, Medicine, Infectious Diseases Brigham And Women’s Hospital Research Associate, Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: The combination of the antiviral medicine nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) which boosts antiviral levels was found to reduce the need for hospitalization by nearly 90% among unvaccinated people. Whether nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir can also help vaccinated people was uncertain. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: When comparing similar patients with early COVID-19 we found that those receiving nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir were approximately 45% less likely to be hospitalized than those that received no treatment. This protection was observed among all groups of patients, including vaccinated and boosted patients. The overall rate of hospitalization was relatively low among vaccinated patients but it was even lower among those that received nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: Early treatment with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir can make COVID-19 safer for both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients at elevated risk.

non-terminal,"Maternal Exposure to Environmental Chemicals may play role in Pediatric Liver Disease MedicalResearch.com Interview with: Dr. Midya Vishal Midya , PhD, MStat Postdoctoral Researcher Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in children in the U.S, Europe and other world regions, currently affecting 1 in every 10 children, and 1 in every 3 children with obesity in the U.S. The rate of pediatric NAFLD has more than doubled in recent decades following the epidemic rates also noted for childhood obesity. There is increasing interest in the role that environmental chemical exposures may play in NAFLD etiology, since several animal studies have shown that prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) cause liver injury and damage; but, until now, the potential effects of prenatal EDC mixture exposures in pediatric NAFLD had not been studied. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: In this study, we measured 45 chemicals in the blood or urine from 1, pregnant women from six European countries and found that maternal exposure to several environmental chemical exposures may play in NAFLD etiology, since several animal studies have shown that prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly used in consumer and industrial products increases risk for NAFLD in the child. Environmental chemical exposures may play in NAFLD etiology, since several animal studies have shown that prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals are known to interfere with the hormone systems and pass through the placenta from the mother to the fetus altering fetal programming and development. Examples of chemicals we investigated include perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals, used in nonstick cookware and food packaging, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) used as flame retardants in furniture and infant products. Other chemical classes we studied include pesticides, plastics, and toxic metals. When the children reached the ages of 6 to 11 years old, we measured the levels of liver enzymes and cytokeratin-18 that indicate risk for NAFLD in the children’s blood, finding elevated levels of those biomarkers in children who had been more highly exposed to environmental chemicals, and especially to persistent organochlorine pesticides, PFAS, PBDEs, and metals, during pregnancy. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: It is important to be aware of the health risks that endocrine-disrupting chemicals pose for the mother and the developing fetus and possible ways to avoid these exposures. Some effective ways in reducing exposure to EDCs in pregnancy and early childhood include avoiding the use of products that contain them, such as plastic containers, bottles, packaging and toys, canned food and beverages, fast/processed foods, non-stick cookware, pesticides and cosmetics, and consuming fresh and organic foods whenever possible. However, EDCs are ubiquitous in consumer products and the environment, and there are many sources of exposure that are beyond the control of individuals. Therefore, policy changes are sorely needed, such as banning the use of EDCs in consumer products and requiring companies to disclose what chemicals are in a product. This would let consumers make informed choices for their health. MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work? Response: NAFLD is now diagnosed in children as young as 2 years of age, and NAFLD in childhood is associated with increased risk for severe chronic liver disease later in adulthood. We need more research and longitudinal studies to elucidate the potential effects of early life EDC exposures on pediatric NAFLD and its progression to more severe liver diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. We also need further research to understand how environmental chemical exposures may interact with our genes, diet and social factors in the development of pediatric liver disease. This information will be informative in designing more effective early life prevention and intervention strategies to reverse the current NAFLD epidemic in children and subsequently adults in the future. MedicalResearch.com: Is there anything else you would like to add?

non-terminal,"What Is Hyperstension And Its Causes What is high blood pressure? Hypertension is a common condition that affects the arteries of the body. Also called high blood pressure. With high blood pressure, the force of the blood pushing against the walls of the arteries is always too strong. The heart has to work harder to pump blood. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg. Hypertension is generally defined as blood pressure above /80mmHg. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association divide blood pressure into four general categories. Ideal blood pressure is classified as normal. ) Normal blood pressure: Blood pressure below /80mmHg. Increased blood pressure: Upper number ranges from to mm Hg and lower number is less than or equal to 80 mm Hg. Hypertension Stage 1: Upper number ranges from to mm Hg or lower number mm Hg. Hypertension Stage 2: The upper value is mmHg or more, or the lower value is 90mmHg or more. Blood pressure above / mmHg is considered a hypertensive emergency or crisis. Anyone with these blood pressure readings should seek emergency medical help. Untreated high blood pressure increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, and other serious health problems. It is important to have your blood pressure measured at least every 2 years from the age of 18. Some people need more frequent tests. Healthy lifestyle habits such as quitting smoking, exercising, and eating a healthy diet can help prevent and treat high blood pressure. Some people need drugs to treat high blood pressure. Symptoms Most people with hypertension have no symptoms, even when blood pressure levels reach dangerously high levels. For years, people can suffer from high blood pressure without symptoms. People with high blood pressure may have the following symptoms: Headache Shortness of breath Nosebleed However, these symptoms are not specific. It usually does not appear until high blood pressure reaches a serious or life-threatening stage. When to See a Doctor Blood pressure screening is an important part of general health care. How often you need to check your blood pressure depends on your age and general health. After age 18, have your blood pressure checked by your doctor at least every two years. If you're over 40 or and at high risk for high blood pressure, ask to have your blood pressure checked annually. If you have high blood pressure or other heart disease risk factors, your healthcare provider may recommend more frequent testing. Children over the age of 3 can have their blood pressure measured at an annual physical examination. If you don’t see your healthcare provider regularly, you may be able to get a free blood pressure test at a health fair or elsewhere in your community. Free blood pressure monitors are also available at some stores and pharmacies. The accuracy of these machines depends on several factors such as: B. Proper cuff size and proper use of machines. Talk to your doctor about using a public blood pressure monitor. Cause of blood pressure Blood pressure is determined by two factors: the amount of blood pumped by the heart and the difficulty of moving blood through the arteries. The more blood the heart pumps and the narrower the arteries, the higher the blood pressure. There are two main types of hypertension. 1. Primary Hypertension , also known as Essential Hypertension For most adults, high blood pressure has no identifiable cause. This type of hypertension is called primary or essential hypertension. It tends to develop gradually over years. Deposits in arteries called atherosclerosis increase the risk of high blood pressure. 2. Secondary Hypertension This type of hypertension is caused by an underlying medical condition. It usually begins suddenly and causes higher blood pressure than primary hypertension. A physical examination alone can raise blood pressure. This is called white coat hypertension. The risk of high blood pressure increases with age. By the age of 64, men are more likely to have high blood pressure. A woman is more likely to have high blood pressure when she is over 65. Hypertension is particularly common among blacks. It occurs at an earlier age in blacks than in whites. Causes Family history. If you have a parent or sibling with high blood pressure, you are more likely to have high blood pressure. Obesity or overweight. Being overweight causes changes in your blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of your body. These changes often raise blood pressure. Being overweight or obese also increases the risk of heart disease and its risk factors, such as: B. High cholesterol. Lack of exercise. Not exercising can lead to weight gain. Being overweight increases your risk of high blood pressure. Inactive people also tend to have higher heart rates Tobacco use or vaping. Smoking, chewing tobacco, and e-cigarettes can cause blood pressure to rise sharply in a short period of time. Smoking cigarettes damages the walls of blood vessels and accelerates the hardening process of the arteries.If you smoke, ask your caregiver about ways to help you quit. Too much salt . When you have a lot of salt (also called sodium) in your body, your body retains water. This raises blood pressure. Low potassium level. Potassium helps balance the amount of salt in the body’s cells. A balanced potassium ratio is important for heart health. Low potassium levels can be caused by a lack of potassium in your diet or by certain health conditions such as dehydration. Excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption is associated with increased blood pressure, especially in men. Stress. Extreme stress can cause temporary increases in blood pressure Stress-related habits such as heavy eating, smoking and drinking alcohol can further increase blood pressure. Certain chronic diseases. Kidney disease, diabetes, and sleep apnea are some of the conditions that can lead to high blood pressure. Pregnancy. Pregnancy can also cause high blood pressure. Hypertension is most common in adults. However, children can also have high blood pressure. High blood pressure in children can be caused by kidney or heart problems. However, the number of children with high blood pressure is increasing due to lifestyle habits such as unhealthy eating habits and lack of exercise. Complications Excessive pressure on artery walls caused by high blood pressure can damage blood vessels and body organs. The higher the blood pressure and the longer it goes uncontrolled, the greater the damage. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to complications such as: Heart attack or stroke. Hardening and thickening of arteries due to high blood pressure or other factors can lead to heart attack, stroke, or other complications. Aneurysm. When blood pressure rises, the blood vessels weaken and swell, forming an aneurysm. Rupture of an aneurysm can be life-threatening. Heart failure. High blood pressure forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. Stress thickens the walls of the heart’s pumping chambers. This condition is called left ventricular hypertrophy. Eventually, the heart can no longer pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs, leading to heart failure. Kidney problem. High blood pressure can narrow or weaken the blood vessels in the kidneys. This can lead to kidney damage eye problems. Increased blood pressure can cause blood vessels in the eye to thicken, narrow, or burst. This can lead to vision loss. Metabolic Syndrome . This syndrome is a group of metabolic disorders of the body. It is about the irregular breakdown of sugar, also called glucose. This syndrome includes increased waist size, high triglycerides, decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL or “good) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. These conditions increase your chances of developing diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, changes with memory and understanding. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can impair your ability to think, remember, and learn. Dementia. Narrowed or blocked arteries can restrict blood flow to the brain. This can lead to a specific type of dementia called vascular dementia. A stroke that blocks blood flow to the brain can also cause vascular dementia.",tumblr

I remember back in my grocery store cashier days I did so much crazy shit. When WIC (Women, infants, and children voucher program to help low income mothers/families with children) people were in my line I would pretty much know who they were. Before the cards they had to tell us upfront they were WIC and show us their vouchers for what they were allowed to get (it was awful some times. Like. 2 gallons of milk. $4 worth of vegetables etc etc. They’d always have items hanging back, waiting to see what the total was and if they would have to take it off the belt. I began to place the fruits/vegetables a certain way on the register scale so that like 1/2lbs of grapes read as like .28lbs or something. Then act shocked when I said that they still had X amount of lbs left. They got all their fruit and vegetables. I think it started to kinda? Catch on to the women? Because I would have the same moms in my line month after month. And even after they switched to the cards (they worked like food stamp cards) I’d still do the same thing. They were able to get more produce for whatever shitty max amount Indiana gave them. Anyways. Be chaotic. It’s more fun that way. ALT",tumblr

I’m saying this extremely seriously. We have got to get past this. Fucking sick of it. People lose their lives and years to this. Whole generations were ruined by these ideas and expectations. people are being so fucking weird about this post I swear to fuck I’m literally talking about how being overly conscious about weight to the point of knowing no joy and being too self conscious and afraid to eat fucking cookies. Like shut the god damn hell up fatphobia needs to be discussed as something that destroys peoples’ ability to enjoy things with other people. Eating and food are things that bring people together as a community and as friends. I’m talking about this explicitly — fatphobia is extremely bad and it was invented because someone somewhere wanted to sell you your own alienation so they could make more money on you being dissatisfied with something you have actually extremely little control over. Fatphobia is bad. Being discriminatory because of a natural body process is bad. That’s it. That’s the point of this post.,tumblr

I now have a wedge pillow, made of one piece of foam. And I ordered a book cushion from etsy, and I just wanna say to anyone who has thought “that adaptive thing seems like it would be useful, but I’m not disabled, so maybe it’s not for me” It’s for you. Trust me. My back hurt because I was slouching weird on the couch. I got a husband pillow. It helped a lot. But, it turns out, what I need is one giant piece of memory foam, not a bunch of tiny bits. And the book cushion? Books are heavy sometimes. Being able to rest it higher in my lap so it’s easier to read and hold? Better for my body. Also, do you wake up with pain in the mornings? Try a contour pillow and a knee pillow. Get those extra-strong treaded soles to wear with your heels because you wobble otherwise. Wear compression gloves when you type. Get those orthopedic shoes because you can walk longer distances in more comfort. Buy the bra that actually supports the weight of your boobs. Get a lapdesk for your computer. Use a neck pillow even at home to keep your neck straight. Wear socks to bed. Listen to audiobooks. Read large print books. You see something that you think will work for you and improve how you feel? Use it! Let’s fucking normalize adaptative shit for everyone! Also, don’t think “Oh but I’m taking this from a disabled person” The more people who use assistive devices, and show demand for assistive devices, THE MORE THEY MAKE AND THE BETTER THEY GET. The best example of this I can think of is canes. When I started using a cane 10 years ago, they were either one color, or old lady patterns. There were all of two grip designs, and they honestly kinda sucked. Now, as more and more people have realized they need them, and have gotten them earlier in their lives for a variety of problems, canes are SO DOPE NOW. You can get them in Galaxy print! Neon colors! Different ergonomic grips! You can even get what I have, which is angle-adjustable arm crutches! Overcome your internal ableism, and let yourself use the thing that prevents pain or makes your life easier. This disabled person can tell you it’s % worth it.",tumblr

Now I don’t know what to call this, ‘cause it’s not exactly a ‘theory’ more of a recollection, perhaps. I don’t actually think this is something that will reflect from the show, but it just has some sort of eerie link in my brain. The image shown is a young girl mangled in the background, holding a hammer, with Welcome Home’s character Julie in the front. It could be the similarly blond hairdo, or the name being so close, but this image reminds me of Judith Barsi, the young girl who voiced parts Duckie from “A Land Before Time” and Ann-Marie from “All Dogs Go To Heaven” The latter being her last role. It was her last role because, at 10 years old, Judith and her mother was killed by her father who immediately committed suicide after the gruesome act. Art often imitates life. For a moment, I wondered if Judith Barsi’s story somewhat inspired whatever story the little girl in this picture has. Could she be Julie’s voice? Was the little girl also a child actress taken way before her time? And why is the flower with eyes that she’s holding the same color pallet as Wally Darling?

This would be grossly inconvenient were it to happen in any bureaucracy, but the fact that it dictates whether or not I can receive medical attention is mind boggling to me. (We still have no idea why all this happened. Apparently the government suddenly decided ‘you’re not eligible. When we asked why, the government said 'what? idk, haha, you are eligible, my bad, just go re-submit all your info and apply again) Gah. TL;DR - I have medical insurance again. (At last. Again. ) Yey!",tumblr
non-terminal,"Zombies! Zombies! Or not. The emergency broadcast system was tested on Oct 4th. The landlady had requested that we turn our phones and computers off and that the broadband be disconnected. She had also apparently rigged up some sort of faraday cage around the whole property to protect it. (The only evidence of this I saw was a bed frame propped up against a chair with a plant on it across the driveway) I didn’t turn off my laptop or my phone, was woken by an obnoxious alert at 8.30 in the morning, and promptly did not turn into a zombie. Thank goodness for that potted plant and old bed frame - phew! In other news, the landlady would like me to adapt her novel, ‘A Quantum Love Story’ into a script so it can be adapted to film. She offered to pay me in therapy to help me get over the effects of chemo. I said I’d recovered from all that, thank you. She looked meaningfully at the many scars all over my wrists and arms and said her therapies could help with other things too. I smiled and said thank you, I was fine. (My scars are numerous and deep but they are also old) I’ve never had someone look at my scars and immediately try to use them as leverage in a business transaction. Special.",tumblr

Everything on Island that doesn’t concern medical or legal matters seems to get done via friends of friends, and it’s always a coin toss as to whether it ends up being legitimate or a pipe dream. Hawi is a tiny town consisting of one and a half streets and has a thriving artistic community, and quite a few tourists in season. The property is three minutes away from the local farmers’ market, so it would be easy for me to sell my art prints and jewellery. Also it would be nice to escape the mad landlady…",tumblr

Not that there were many I could make the walk to, to be fair. “if someone is homeless, they can just forage for food! Probably eating healthier than we are har har har” I was homeless in winter. And yeah, sure, I knew how to use pine needles to make tea and boil bark but. Come on. You think every homeless person has that fucking knowledge or resources? And I was homeless on a mountain . What about people who are homeless in cities ? What are they going to forage? Gravel? And what about areas where foraging is illegal? You want them to get arrested ? In a police state like this ? “well as long as they don’t get into trouble, there won’t be trouble” You make laws criminalizing their existence. The “trouble” they make is surviving . I got the cops called on me because I went for a walk. I had a stick I was using to help me walk because I have a limp and couldn’t afford a cane. A fucking white couple saw me and called the cops and told them I was walking “with a rifle” and was “very threatening. I got DAMNED lucky that a Light horseman found me first and told me what happened. Laughed a little. Told me not to worry about it, he’d call it in as bogus, and have a talk with the couple. But again. I was lucky. If that had been a state cop and not a rez one, I could have been fucking shot. For walking . Honestly, if you are not for the liberation of homeless people, if you are not for decriminalizing homelessness and all aspects of it, if you say things like, “now I support those people, but I wish I didn’t have to see it, because it makes me uncomfy” you have swallowed the propaganda pill.

People who say that money doesn’t buy happiness have never eaten pasta every day because it’s 50 cents at the grocery store or been short on money for christmas presents.

Also, something I feel like gets lost on the people who keep repeating that “money doesn’t buy happiness” is that money itself isn’t going to make you happy. Or getting additional money when you have plenty isn’t going to instantly make you happier. But financial safety is one of the most universal aspects of happiness in the world we live in (even if we wish this wasn’t the case.

We’re working on some things that we want to share with you. AI companies are acquiring content across the internet for a variety of purposes in all sorts of ways. There are currently very few regulations giving individuals control over how their content is used by AI platforms. Proposed regulations around the world, like the European Union’s AI Act, would give individuals more control over whether and how their content is utilized by this emerging technology. We support this right regardless of geographic location, so we’re releasing a toggle to opt out of sharing content from your public blogs with third parties, including AI platforms that use this content for model training. We’re also working with partners to ensure you have as much control as possible regarding what content is used. Here are the important details: We already discourage AI crawlers from gathering content from Tumblr and will continue to do so, save for those with which we partner. We want to represent all of you on Tumblr and ensure that protections are in place for how your content is used. We are committed to making sure our partners respect those decisions. To opt out of sharing your public blogs’ content with third parties, visit each of your public blogs’ blog settings via the web interface and toggle on the “Prevent third-party sharing” option.

Nor is the problem that they’re all trying to make money, although that’s definitely part of it* The problem isn’t even the Nazis, white nationalists, Chris Rufos, TERFs, and all other manners of asshole that barge into spaces created and populated by well-meaning people, shit on the floor, and yell at everyone who asks them to clean it up and not do it again. The problem is that the people in charge of those spaces won’t stop them from coming back. What do you do when a party host won’t kick out the wild drunk that’s ruining the party? You find a new party. What do you do when the wild drunk shows up again and your new host also won’t kick them out? What do you do when this happens again, and again, and again? What do you do when every single party you’ve been going to for the last decade keeps having the same wild drunk show up and shit on the floor? I wrote about how the internet has changed, and how it’s changing again, over on my blog. Check it out! What It’s Like To Be On The Internet In — Sean Curry So hey, you know how I said if we keep relying on platforms to build our audiences, we’ll only end up having to rebuild on a new platform every years? Substack Is Setting Writers Up For A Twitter-Style Implosion But when Substack tanks — and I think its right-wing, Musk-flavored, tech-bro-brained management indicates that it will — it won’t just mean losing the audience for our -character late-night gummy jokes and covfefe memes. It won’t just mean losing a huge community of colleagues and readers. It will mean losing a substantial portion of the audience for content that takes a hell of a lot more effort to produce — the thoughtful rants, the reported deep-dives, the serial fiction, the smart criticism. And without access to “follower” lists and emails, there will be no way to find them again. Writers will, once again, have to rebuild from near-scratch elsewhere. It’s happening again. It’s happening again , just as it will always happen when we build our audiences on platforms owned by people that are beholden to shareholders and investors. We have to build and manage our own platforms. These social platforms—Tumblr included—can be used to drive people to those platforms, but if we rely on these companies to maintain and manage our platforms for us, we are inevitably going to have to rebuild elsewhere.",tumblr

He was helping me create an auto rig. foldingfittedsheets : Something that literally changed my life was working with a friend on a coding thing. He was helping me create an auto rig script and was trying to explain something to me but his words were just turning into static in my brain. I was tired and confused and there was so many new concepts happening. I could feel myself working toward a crying meltdown and was getting preemptively ashamed of what was about to happen when he said, “Hey, are you someone who benefits from breaks” It broke me. Did I benefit from breaks? I didn’t know. I’d never taken them. When a problem frustrated or upset me I just gritted my teeth and plowed through the emotional distress because eventually if you batter and flail at something long enough you figure it out. So what if you get bruised on the way. I viscerally remembered in that moment being forced to sit at the table late into the night with my dad screaming at me, trying to understand math. I remembered taking that with me into adulthood and having breakdowns every week trying to understand coding. I could have taken a break ? Would it help? I didn’t know! I’d never taken one! “Yes” I told him. We paused our call. I ate lunch. I focused on other stuff for half an hour. I came back in a significantly better state of mind, and the thing he’d been trying to explain had been gently cooking in the back of my head and seemed easier to understand. Now when I find myself gritting my teeth at problems I can hear his gentle voice asking if I benefit from breaks. Yes, dear god, yes why did I never get taught breaks? Why was the only way I knew to keep suffering until something worked? I was relating to this same friend recently my roadtrip to the redwoods with my wife. “We stopped every hour or so to get out and stretch our legs and switch drivers. It was really nice. When I was a kid we’d just drive twelve hours straight and not stop for anything, just gas. We’d eat in the car and power through” He gave a wry smile, immediately connecting the mindset of my parents on a road trip to what they’d instilled in me about brute forcing through discomfort. “Do you benefit from breaks” he echoed, drawing my attention to it, making me smile with the same sad acknowledgement. Take breaks. You’re allowed. You don’t have to slam into problems over and over and over, let yourself rest. It will get easier. Take. Breaks. whewwwww",tumblr

Few details are known of the sales, because keeping each one small meant their contents remained secret, but they are reported to have included precision-guided munitions, small diameter bombs, bunker busters, small arms and other lethal aid. The Arms Export Control Act makes significant exceptions for arms sales to close allies – a limit of $25m for ‘major defense equipment, defined as big-ticket items that require a lot of research and development, but the limit rises to $m for other “defense articles” like bombs. “This doesn’t just seem like an attempt to avoid technical compliance with US arms export law, it’s an extremely troubling way to avoid transparency and accountability on a high-profile issue” Ari Tolany, director of the security assistance monitor at the Centre for International Policy thinktank, said. She added that, in exploiting the loophole, the Biden administration was following the steps of its predecessor. “They’re very much borrowing from the Trump playbook to dodge congressional oversight” Tolany said.

It’s a normal first person game. You are an alter, the character is the body. This is fronting. Other people live with you. Sometimes, they come into the room and sit and watch while you play. They sometimes try to guide you, give you advice on what to do next. They don’t always agree, and they can argue with each other. Other times they scream at you that you’re doing everything wrong and you suck at this game. This is co-consciousness. Imagine how distracting it would be for people around you to tell you what to do, or to scream at each other or at you, even if they have good intentions. It wouldn’t be easy to focus on your game, would it? Then sometimes, something happens in the game that prompts you to hand off the controller to someone else so they can play and you get a break. This is (some types of) switching. This can be good. Other times, someone rips the controller out of your hand or fights you for it. This is (other types of) switching. And sometimes, six other players hook up their controllers, but there’s only one character to play as. So all of you have your controllers, but you’re all trying to play the same character. This is cofronting. Imagine how difficult that would be. Imagine how hard it would be to try and play a game while someone is trying to take the controller from you, or while six other people are trying to play too. There are also times that nobody is playing, or you can’t decide who should play. What’s happening to the character in the game? What are they doing if no one is playing? This is dissociation. The character is doing nothing. They’re stuck. This is the best metaphor I have come up with for being a system. It’s something a lot of people get because they’ve played games before.",tumblr

Their training goes higher up the chain. There are some amazing advances made in medicine. Still, it is over-used and abused. Medicine and surgeries should rarely be the first line of defense. THE PROBLEM: The medical system (funded by big pharma) only trains physicians in medicine with maybe 25 hours of nutrition…if you’re lucky. In addition, doctors receive incentives from pharmaceutical companies to endorse them. (Don’t take my word for it, look this up) Big pharma has their tentacles everywhere. Still think it’s about health? If you visit a western medicine doctor’s office, you are not being told all of your options because of the biased training they received. Once in a while you might meet a doctor who further educated themselves in nutrition because they woke up to this and wanted to better help his/her patients. Those are rare gems, but they are out there. Medicine is great for acute or emergency situations, but nutrition (and stress/emotional management) is when true healing takes place. 🧬",tumblr

non-terminal,"Cerebral Palsy and Autism Spectrum Disorder Functioning Cerebral Palsy and Autism Spectrum Disorder Functioning Over the years and with the help of my blog, I am able to piece my disabilities together. Also, with the help of medical notes and further research I am finally able to bring my physical, mental and emotional disabilities together, so that I can move forward with certainty. Growing up without knowing about either disability, I don’t have normal functioning. I am sorry if this sounds like or feels like a repeat. I need to be sure; to place both of my disabilities. Cerebral Palsy I have Cerebral palsy and autism. They are two separate conditions that co-occur. Cerebral Palsy affects muscle co-ordination and my muscle tone is mostly affected. I have difficulty in regulating emotions and feelings due to the impact it has on the brain and nervous system. I also have trouble expressing myself, understanding social cues and managing emotions in a typical way. I deal with anxiety, low-line depression, and those can lead to frustrations and challenges. Like all disabilities, there needs to be an acceptance from others on what we deal with. Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterised by challenges with social interaction, communication and repetitive behaviours. I have intellectual disabilities, while others with autism may have average or above-average intelligence. I have strengths in areas such as attention to detail and memory. I take things literal, find it hard to understand humour and sarcasm. Most often I need to be in the same routine and can get anxious if that were to change. I can get anxious in social situations, or going into new situations without researching what they may look or feel like. I deal with sensory issues. Living with both disorders Living with cerebral palsy and autism means I have unique challenges and needs relating to both. I mostly struggle with mental functioning. In Brexit and Covid-19, around their handling, autism became my biggest challenge, when anxiety and depression began to see the light of day. Before that, both were easier to contain.

I needed to understand myself. Books play a significant role in supporting mental health, particularly in relation to trauma. Emotional Connection and Empathy Reading non-fiction books, allows individuals to connect with real people who may be going through similar experiences. This can provide comfort, reduce feelings of isolation and foster empathy. Identifying with them and their struggles can help individuals understand that they are not alone in their pain, or challenges. Education and Awareness Books and blogs can educate individuals about mental health, including trauma-related disorders. They can generate productive conversations about complex and sensitive topics. Reading and reflecting on personal experiences related to the content can promote understanding, self-awareness and personal growth. Children’s Mental Health When it comes to children’s mental health, books can play a crucial role in supporting their needs. They can help children develop awareness and resilience from an early age. Books about mental health can provide children with concepts to explore, to help them understand their emotions, fostering curiosity and a growth mindset – children between the ages of 5 and 16 are likely to have mental health problems. (Source: childrensocietyorg) – as a child I dealt with mental health problems. Personal Growth and Relaxation Reading non-fiction mental health books – engaging with real-life shows you’re not alone, especially during challenging times. Reading in general can reduce stress, improve sleep quality, and promote personal growth. Addressing mental health is crucial for overall well-being.

It’s a unique and individual journey that is often shaped by a multitude of factors, including: The nature of the loss The nature and type of loss, the circumstances surrounding it and the degree of anticipation can impact the grieving process. The individual’s coping mechanisms People may have different coping strategies, such as emotional expression, avoidance or denial, which can influence their grief experience. Personal relationship The relationship the person had with the deceased, as well as their social support network, can play a significant role in shaping their grief. Support is important in tackling grief. Emotional resilience A person’s ability to cope with stress and adversity can affect their capacity to navigate grief. Life experiences Past experiences of trauma, loss, and adversity can impact an individual’s ability to cope with grief. Not all relationships run smooth and grief can compound that. Physical health The physical health of the person grieving can also play a role in their grief experience, as physical pain or illness can exacerbate emotional distress. Grief is messy Grief doesn’t stick to a timetable. It’s a messy, unpredictable, and often a non-linear process that can ebb and flow over time. What’s more, it’s not uncommon for people to experience different types of grief reactions at different times, such as denial, avoidance, anger, depression or acceptance. Grief is a gentle reminder of our loss and the importance of dealing with grief. By acknowledging the complexity and uniqueness of grief, of our own and others’ individual experiences, we can better support ourselves and others navigate through what is often-turbulent times.

non-terminal,"Secondary Trauma Secondary Trauma Experiencing trauma that doesn’t directly belong to you typically refers to secondary trauma, second hand trauma, or vicarious trauma. This occurs when an individual is indirectly exposed to traumatic events through hearing about or witnessing the experiences of others. For example, healthcare professionals, first responders, therapists and journalists. Individuals exposed, having to support loved ones through traumatic experiences might encounter secondary trauma. Secondary trauma is the reason I sustained a mouth muscle injury and the reason why I have tinnitus and the reason why on occasion I am failing to cope. The Research “According to Saba Harouni Lurie, LMFT and founder of Take Root Therapy, secondary trauma is a stress response in reaction to hearing about or being witness to the firsthand traumatic experience of another. Firsthand trauma can be in the form of emotional distress or physical pain. Secondary trauma develops when hearing about someone else’s trauma and the intense, persistent stress that can come with that is a consistent part of someone’s life” (Source: psychcentralcom) Emotional and psychological effects This form of trauma can have significant emotional, psychological, and even physical effects on individuals, leading to symptoms similar to those experienced by direct trauma survivors, such as anxiety, nightmares, depression, flashbacks and feelings of helplessness or guilt. Secondary trauma: practice self-care It is essential for those exposed to secondary trauma to practice self-care, seek support and, if needed, get professional help to process their emotions and prevent burnout. Additionally, creating boundaries, practicing mindfulness and engaging in activities that promote relaxation and wellbeing, can be beneficial in coping with secondary trauma. It is important not to own trauma that doesn’t belong to you. Ways to support someone who has experienced trauma include: Listening without judgment and offering a safe space for them to share their feelings and experiences. Validating their feelings and letting them know that it’s okay to feel the way they do. Offering to help in practical ways, such as helping them connect with resources. Encouraging them to seek professional help if needed and remind them that it’s okay to ask for help. Being patient and understanding that healing from trauma takes time. It’s okay not to have all the answers or solutions to support someone who has experienced trauma. Simply being there for them and showing that you care, makes a big difference in their healing.

non-terminal,"Understanding Protein Quality Understanding Protein Quality Understanding protein quality is crucial for maintaining overall health and supporting specific nutritional goals. Complete proteins are particularly valuable, because they provide all essential amino acids necessary for various bodily functions, including muscle repair and growth. Animal sources like milk, eggs and meat typically offer complete proteins, while many plant-based sources may require combining complementary proteins to ensure all essential amino acids are present. The Importance of Adequate Protein Intake When it comes to weight loss, preserving muscle mass is crucial for maintaining metabolic health and achieving long-term results. A sufficient protein intake, particularly from high-quality sources like whey protein and casein, can help promote satiety and preserve muscle mass during calorie restriction. Benefits for Older Adults As we age, our muscle mass and strength naturally decline. However, a high-quality protein intake can help mitigate this decline and support overall health and independence in later years. For older adults, sufficient protein intake is essential for maintaining muscle mass, bone density, and overall well-being. Athletes and increased protein Athletes have increased protein needs due to the demands of training and exercise. Quality protein sources are vital for muscle repair and recovery, optimising performance and achieving training goals effectively. Plant-based diets For those following a plant-based diet, understanding how to combine different protein sources to ensure adequate amino acid intake is key. Complementary proteins like those found in combinations such as rice and beans or hummus and pita can provide complete protein profiles when consumed together. Variety and balance It’s easy to get caught up in the importance of high-quality protein sources, but it’s equally important to remember that all protein sources, regardless of quality, contribute to our overall protein needs. Variety and balance in our diet are key to ensuring we’re meeting our daily requirements and supporting how the body functions. (Source: nutritionnews.

non-terminal,"Subconscious Check-In Subconscious Check-In I’ve been tapping into my subconscious for years. It’s how I’ve come to know about and come to terms with my experiences. The subconscious helps you to change the way you think; it can also promote personal growth and spirituality. This blog goes into detail. Your intuition works with your subconscious. Once you’ve got the hang of tapping into and working with your intuition and you become more aware of your inner voice, or little whisper, you can start asking your subconscious questions; questions like… what is my subconscious mind trying to tell me? What is it trying to communicate? More possible questions to ask your subconscious might be: What is my greatest fear or anxiety? What is my deepest desire or passion? What am I holding onto that is no longer serving me? What am I avoiding or procrastinating about? The subconscious can help you to become aware through different signals such as: A feeling in your body, such as a tingling, a light or a heavy feeling An image An emotion A thought An image A gesture An impulse to do something Involuntary muscle movement My subconscious helps me to become aware through an emotion, a heavy feeling, an inner thought, a feeling that produces an intention, an impulse to act on what my emotions are presenting me with. Intuition, often referred to as “gut feeling” or “sixth sense” plays a significant role in shaping our decisions and actions. Intuition is a powerful force Intuition is a powerful force, as it allows us to make decisions and take actions that may not be immediately rational or logical, but based on a deep sense of knowing. It’s as if our intuition is whispering, guiding us towards a particular path or decision. We may not even realise the extent to which our intuition is influencing our decisions until we reflect on our experiences and realise just how often we’ve followed our gut instincts. The subconscious mind’s crucial role The subconscious mind plays a crucial role in helping us become aware of certain emotions, thoughts and feelings that can influence our intentions and impulses. It’s not just a random or fleeting idea, but rather a culmination of years of subconscious pattern recognition. This means that your intuition is often built on a foundation of past experiences, memories and learned behaviours that have been processed and stored in our subconscious mind. The subconscious reflects how you feel about your relationships, and your experiences around those relationships, the good and bad. Those experiences are not something you should ignore. Recognising the power of our intuition By recognising the power of our intuition, we can tap into this silent yet potent force that guides our actions in everyday life. This can help us make more informed decisions, navigate uncertain situations, and respond to challenges with greater confidence and clarity. Intuition — a ‘silent force’ The phrase “silent force” highlights the idea that our intuition may not always be loud or overt, but its impact can be profound. We may not even realise the extent to which our intuition is influencing our decisions until we reflect on our experiences and realise just how often we’ve followed our gut instincts. You should trust your intuition This statement encourages us to trust our intuition more, to listen to our inner voice — the voice that guides us. By acknowledging the power of our intuition, we can learn to tap into it more effectively and make more informed decisions that align with our values and goals. I am reminded of the importance of tuning into my own intuition and trusting my inner wisdom. It is a valuable reminder that we all have this capacity within us, waiting to be accessed. The Pendulum The pendulum technique is a technique I use. It is a technique that has been used for centuries to tap into the subconscious mind and gain insight into various aspects of your life. Here’s a breakdown of how it works: The Pendulum: Bio-Feedback Mechanism The pendulum is a simple, yet powerful tool that allows us to access our subconscious mind. The idea is that our subconscious mind is constantly sending out subtle signals, which are then picked up by our body. These signals are too small to be consciously detected, but they can be amplified and translated into a physical response. How the ‘Pendulum’ Works As you hold the pendulum, your subconscious mind sends out tiny, involuntary muscle movements to your hand. These micro-movements are so small that they’re imperceptible to our conscious mind. However, these subtle movements can cause the pendulum to swing or move in response to the subconscious signal. The pendulum: No external force is required Contrary to what you think or understand about the pendulum, no external force is required to move the pendulum. The movement is entirely due to the subtle interactions between your subconscious mind and the physical body. No Voodoo or Magic It is important to emphasise there is no magic or voodoo involved in using the pendulum. To recap, the pendulum is simply a tool that amplifies and translates the subconscious signals into a physical response. Practical applications The pendulum can be used for various purposes, such as: Gaining insight into a situation or problem Answering questions or seeking guidance Identifying patterns or connections Detecting energies or vibrations Facilitating meditation and introspection Tips and Precautions: Start with simple questions and gradually move on to more complex ones You will need to keep your mind open and focused Try to avoid influencing the pendulum with your conscious thoughts Use a neutral or calm environment to minimise external distractions Practice regularly to develop your skills and intuition. By understanding the bio-feedback mechanism behind pendulum dowsing, you can unlock its potential and use it as a powerful tool for personal growth, self-discovery and gaining insight into various aspects of life. Intuition is often referred to as the “automatic” or “ unconscious” mind and it is estimated to process up to 90% of our thoughts and behaviours. Here are a few ways it can impact our lives: Pattern recognition Our subconscious mind is wired to recognise patterns and make connections between seemingly unrelated events. This can lead to habitual thinking, emotional responses, or decision-making patterns that may not be in our best interests. Emotional regulation The subconscious mind is responsible for regulating our emotions, including fear, anxiety, and stress. These emotions can and often do influence our behaviour and decision-making without us even realising. Memory consolidation The subconscious mind is also responsible for consolidating memories and learning from past experiences. This can influence our behaviours, attitudes, and decisions without us consciously realising. Automatic responses The subconscious mind is responsible for automatic responses to certain stimuli, such as fear responses or knee-jerk reactions. These automatic responses can be triggered by subtle cues or stimuli without us even realising it. The subconscious mind is the reason family feud, the reason politicians fall out, the reason wars are started. The subconscious mind is the part of the brain that stores painful memories, experiences. The part of the brain we fail to access, but the part of the brain that controls our presenting behaviour. It’s just about responsible for everything. So, how can you check in with your subconscious mind and gain more control over your thoughts, behaviours and decisions? Here are a few strategies: Mindfulness Mindfulness can help increase awareness of your thoughts and emotions, allowing you to better understand your subconscious mind. Self-reflection Regular self-reflection can help you identify patterns and habits in your behaviour and decision-making processes. Journalling Writing down (journalling) your thoughts and feelings can help you process your subconscious mind and gain insight into your past experiences, your motives and what you would like. Seeking professional help If you’re struggling with negative patterns or behaviours that seem to be driven by your subconscious mind, seeking help from a therapist or counsellor can be helpful. By checking in with our subconscious mind and gaining greater awareness of its role in shaping our lives, we can take control of our thoughts, behaviours and decisions, leading to greater self-awareness, personal growth, better decision-making and overall health and wellbeing. (Source: happyrubincom) Conclusion It is important to remember that your subconscious works in the background, processing information and influencing your conscious thoughts and behaviours. By tuning in and listening to your inner voice, its whispers, you can gain insight into your experiences, including the good and the bad. It’s a way of dealing with and moving on from your past. Receiving messages from your subconscious is also a powerful way to tap into your inner wisdom, creativity and intuition. The key is to practice working with your intuition.

It is the foundation of honesty, integrity, and authenticity. It is the essence of reality, unaffected by opinions and beliefs. Writing the Truth Writing the truth requires a commitment to exploring and expressing the facts, even when they are difficult or uncomfortable. It involves delving into the depths of one’s experiences and observations and presenting them honestly and accurately. An Open Mind When it comes to writing the truth, it requires an open mind, a willingness to question assumptions and an ability to separate facts from opinions. It necessitates diligent research, careful analysis and a commitment to accuracy and objectivity. Responsibility and Impact I believe it is important to consider the impact of our words and the responsibility that comes with presenting information to others. The truth can be a powerful tool for change, but it must be used with care and compassion. The truth isn’t always easy to write or for others to read. It can be painful, challenging and sometimes controversial. However, it is essential for seeking understanding, promoting justice and fostering a genuine connection with others. The Necessity of Writing the Truth In a world where misinformation and deceit is easily spread, writing the truth is a necessary antidote. It holds the power to expose deceptions, inspire us to reflect, and create meaningful change. A Moral Obligation When it comes to writing, we all have a moral obligation to write the truth and for our writing to be a pillar of journalistic integrity. It is crucial for the preservation of democracy, the pursuit of justice and the advancement of knowledge. A Higher Purpose Writing the truth is about seeking and sharing a deeper understanding of ourselves, our world and our shared humanity. It is a call to embrace honesty, transparency and the pursuit of a higher truth that transcends personal biases and agendas. It has to. Empower Yourself – Keep It Real Keeping it real may be uncomfortable, it may even “piss us off initially” but keeping it real will in the longer term empower us to make changes and for the better. Keeping it real is a crucial aspect of personal growth, self-awareness and empowerment. By acknowledging and accepting our true selves, and our flaws, we can break free from the shackles of stress, pretence and societal expectations. It’s what I choose to do with The CP Diary – it’s what I continue to do every day. Keeping it real means I can live with mine and the universal truths. Reading and re-reading what I write, also means we can be true and accepting of ourselves – it means lives can flourish and relationships can improve. My blog is genuine, please keep reading!

non-terminal,"A Beginner's Guide to the Chakras A Beginner’s Guide to the Chakras The concept of chakras has a rich and complex history that dates back thousands of years to ancient India. The Vedas, which are considered some of the oldest and most sacred texts of Hinduism, mention the concept of chakras, or energy centers in the body. Chakras Chakras are believed to correspond to different aspects of a person’s physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. In traditional Indian medicine and yogic practices, it is believed that there are seven main chakras located along the spine, starting from the base and reaching up to the crown of the head. Each chakra is associated with a specific colour, element, mantra, and body part, and is believed to govern certain physical and emotional aspects. They are also said to be connected to the flow of energy or life force, known as ‘prana’ in the body. The seven main chakras are: Root Chakra (Muladhara) Located at the base of the spine, it is associated with feelings of stability, security, and grounding. Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana) Located in the lower abdomen, it is associated with creativity, sexuality and emotions. Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) Located in the upper abdomen, it is associated with personal power, confidence and self-esteem. Heart Chakra (Anahata) Located in the center of the chest, it is associated with love, compassion and relationships. Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) Located in the throat, it is associated with communication, self-expression and truth. Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) Located between the eyebrows, it is associated with intuition, insight and spiritual awareness. Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) Located at the top of the head, it is associated with higher consciousness, spirituality and connection to the divine. The Role of Chakras Chakras play a significant role in the energy and balance of the human body. Each chakra is associated with specific qualities and functions. When they are in proper alignment, the chakras can promotes physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. Imbalances or blockages in the chakras can lead to various issues or ailments. Chakras and self-awareness Understanding and working with the chakras can offer a pathway to self-awareness, healing and personal growth. Practices such as meditation, yoga, energy healing, and working with crystals can help to activate and balance the chakras. Working with the Chakras While there is limited scientific evidence to support the existence and effects of chakras, many individuals and practitioners have reported positive experiences and benefits from working with them. It is essential to approach chakra work with an open mind and a willingness to explore and understand oneself on a deeper level. The concept of chakras has deep-rooted origins in ancient Eastern philosophies and it continues to play a significant part in various spiritual and holistic practices, including mediumship. The concepts and practices associated with them can provide guidance and support for personal, spiritual growth and wellbeing.

non-terminal,"Reading Benefits: Books vs Digital Reading Benefits: Books vs Digital Books in a digital world… The debate over reading digital content versus traditional print books encompasses various dimensions, including the physical experience, cognitive effects, environmental impact, and accessibility. There are many advantages to reading physical books that make them a preferable choice over digital: Preference for Print Despite the rise of digital technology and e-readers, (digital) many people still prefer print books. This could be due to the tangible nature of physical books, which provides a sense of ownership and connection that digital formats lack. Additionally, print books do not cause the eye strain associated with prolonged screen time. Enhanced Comprehension and Recall Studies have shown that readers tend to absorb and recall content more effectively when reading physical books. This increased comprehension is attributed to the tactile and sensory engagement that comes with being able to handle a physical book. Tactile experience Physical books offer a sensory experience that e-books can’t repeat. You can hold the book in your hands, feel the weight of the pages and enjoy the tactile sensation of turning the pages. No blue light Physical books don’t emit blue light, which can interfere with sleep and eye health. Reading e-books before bed can disrupt sleep patterns, while physical books won’t. Better retention Studies have shown that readers who use physical books retain more information and have better comprehension than those who read e-books. No distractions Reading physical books are free from distractions like notification emails, and social media, allowing you to focus on your reading. No dependence on technology You don’t need a device or battery to read a physical book, making them a great option for travel or areas with limited access to technology. Sense of accomplishment Finishing a physical book can give you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that’s harder to achieve with e-books. Additionally, comprehension is significantly better with physical books compared to e-readers suggests several advantages associated with traditional print.

They include: Motivation Understanding the different motives for exercise can help individuals tailor their exercise routines to align with their personal goals. For example, men may be more motivated by social and competitive aspects of exercise, while women may be more motivated by appearance-related goals, such as weight loss or maintenance. Exercise Preferences Recognising the differences in exercise habits between men and women helps individuals choose exercise activities that align with their preferences. Men may be more inclined towards sports and competitive activities, while women may prefer activities such as walking or biking. Societal Factors Understanding the influence of gender roles and societal expectations can help individuals navigate any barriers or challenges they may face in maintaining regular exercise habits. For example, women in traditional eastern cultures may have less time for exercise due to care giving responsibilities. Health Promotion Programmes Recognising gender differences in exercise behaviours inform the design of gender-specific health promotion programmes. Tailoring interventions to address the specific barriers and motivations of men and women increases the effectiveness of these programmes. Individual preferences can vary It is important to note that our individual preferences and motivations can vary and these findings should be considered as general trends, rather than strict guidelines for all individuals. Personal preferences, goals and individual circumstances should be taken into account when developing exercise habits and behaviours. By understanding these gender differences, individuals can make informed decisions about their exercise routines and create an environment that supports their exercise goals.

The heartbreaking grief of losing a twin is never ending; the shadows are constantly there, more than they were when my twin was here. I will write more. The second born twin Growing up the second born twin, I was always playing catch up. With a disability I didn’t know I had, I relied on my twin more than I understood and that was difficult for her. We both wanted our independence. When we were born, twins shared their lives together. We had little choice; it’s just how that went. A time to reflect Now losing my twin is giving ‘me time’ to reflect. I have clarity. Grief is difficult, the clarity isn’t. Although we are separate now, spiritually we are as one. I wasn’t ready – I am not ready Losing a twin, whether through separation or death, is unique and a challenging experience. I wasn’t expecting what happened to happen, and therefore wasn’t ready to let go. My twin’s death has left me with a sense of gloom. Everything is changed. Through spiritual healing, I now have clarity. Life is a challenge without her. Every day is a challenge Every day has become a challenge; it’s a challenge to keep going, to find hope, to feel better. Tinnitus from the stress of losing her, isn’t helping. A sense of foreboding The family dynamics have changed. Where my twin once resided, and I could rely on her being there, I no longer have that. Instead the loss is great and I am left with a sense of foreboding. Like all relationships, our relationship wasn’t perfect, but when the chips were down, we were there for each other. Spiritual Healing None of it is good. Caught off guard I am still processing. I’ve turned to spiritual healing to find some clarity and a sense of purpose. I know that having a sense of clarity can be empowering, especially being faced with such a profound loss. Life is not the same. The twin bond cannot be replaced. However, it’s important for me to recognise that my twin’s memory and spirit will continue to live on within me. My health has changed I know my twin is well again, my wellness isn’t what it was. Losing her became the catalyst of my own health struggles. Now she’s gone, all I have are the memories of a life with my twin and my sense of foreboding goes on, until I am able to carve out a new life away from my old life. That’s going to take time.

non-terminal,"Healing Through Words Healing Through Words I don’t know when it hit, or when I became aware that my experiences were trauma based and I needed to heal. It was making a physical change, doing something positive and for the first time. While I am aware writing about personal experiences is a powerful tool for understanding and processing emotions, trauma can still be difficult to get past. While writing can help us to understand some of our experiences, it may not fully replace or mend the impact of a traumatic childhood. The reason being experiences and traumas of childhood often have deep-rooted effects that shape an individual’s psyche, and therefore their overall outlook on life. Here are some key points: Processing and Understanding Emotions Writing helps individuals make sense of their feelings and experiences. It provides a structured way to explore and articulate their emotions that might otherwise remain suppressed or unexamined. This process leads to greater self-awareness and emotional clarity. Therapeutic Benefits Engaging in writing about personal experiences has therapeutic benefits. If you continually choose to write, it can serve as a form of release and self-expression, helping to alleviate feelings of anger, pain or even sadness. Many people may find comfort in putting their thoughts into words, being able to read and see their experiences from a different perspective. Validation and Empowerment Sharing personal stories can validate one’s experiences and feelings. It can be empowering, as it allows individuals to reclaim their narrative and assert control over their lives. This can be a crucial step in the healing process. Connection and Support Writing about difficult experiences can foster connection with others who have had similar experiences. Over my years of writing, it is what I have found. It can create a sense of community and support, which is important for healing. Knowing that others have faced similar challenges can be comforting and also motivating. The Writing Process I find writing therapeutic, as I continue through my words to bring explanations to explore my childhood trauma. Writing may not always answer the why questions. On the why questions, it may take years to work those out. Instead, you hope you can find resolution through talking things out. The truth is many of us will face traumatic experiences at some point in our lives. It can be the result of chronic stress, abuse, or neglect. Trauma can also be a cumulative effect of multiple experiences, therapists can help to incorporate specialised techniques on the more difficult issues it’s hard to get past. Long-Term Healing Healing from traumatic childhood issues, including stress, neglect, or abuse, is a long-term process. It often requires developing physical coping strategies and making lifestyle changes to support mental and emotional wellbeing. A final thought It is important to note and acknowledge that finding resolution may not always be possible, especially if the individuals who cause harm are unwilling to take responsibility or apologise. In such cases, healing may involve finding ways to cope with the ongoing emotional impact of the trauma or harm, rather than seeking resolution with the people who caused it. it’s essential to acknowledge that the focus may shift from resolution to healing and coping. Forgiveness is a personal choice that can be difficult to achieve, and it’s not always necessary for healing. For more inspirational, lifestyle blogs, please check out my site",tumblr

non-terminal,"Helicopter Parenting: Coping Strategies Helicopter Parenting: Coping Strategies If you have been affected by helicopter parents, this blog should help. The issues of being a child of helicopter parents means there will be many challenges that follow you into adulthood. It’s not uncommon for children to feel anxious, when their parents are overly-protective, controlling, domineering, involving themselves in your everyday. The following tips should help: Tell your parents how you feel Communication is important. Openly talk to your parents about how you feel. Be specific about what you’re comfortable with. Try to help your parents understand that you appreciate their concern, their help, but it’s important for you to make your own decisions, for you to have your space and independence. Set boundaries Boundaries are important in any relationship. Establish clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship. This might mean setting aside specific times for your parents, or to limit their involvement in certain aspects of your life. Practice assertive communication When expressing your needs or concerns, use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. For example, “I feel overwhelmed when you call me every hour. Could we schedule a specific time to talk each day” instead of “You’re always calling me and it’s annoying” Develop problem-solving skills Encourage your parents to ask you questions and help you find solutions to problems. This will empower you to take ownership of your decisions and develop critical thinking skills. Develop coping mechanisms Learn healthy coping mechanisms, such as deep breathing, exercise, or journalling, to manage stress and anxiety caused by your parents’ over-involvement. Focus on self-care Engage in activities that you enjoy, or spend time with friends. This can help you develop a sense of identity and purpose outside of your relationship with your parents. Parents’ behaviour Often parents’ behaviour is as a result of their own upbringing, their own fears, insecurities and lack of understanding, rather than a personal attack on you. Seek professional help If you’re struggling to cope with the stress and anxiety caused by helicopter parenting, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with personalised guidance and support. Practice self-compassion Be kind to yourself. Remember that you’re doing the best you can in a challenging situation. Conclusion As parents at some point we will have done a little extra to make our child’s life easier. It’s what parents do, right? But the problem with helicopter parenting is that when it comes a regular everyday occurrence, it hinders healthy development. It is essential for parents to strike a balance between providing support and guidance while also giving their children the space to grow and develop independently. By setting boundaries and encouraging self-reliance, parents can help their children develop into confident, capable and self-assured individuals.

Prayers and BTS Friend’s Support Requested To my followers and fellow BTS lovers, I have been battling a very rare blood cancer called Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia for almost 10 years. Last year the immunotherapy drug I had been on for 6 years caused ventricular tachycardia of the heart which caused me to immediately stop therapy. This news was three days after attending Suga/Agust D’s concert in Chicago. What a downer to come home from that amazing, phenomenal concert. I resumed a 2nd generation drug 3 months later which caused additional heart issues and had to reduce the dosage and subsequently stop that therapy in November. There were only two options left, one being a regiment of chemotherapy that would put me in palliative care, or the other option being an autologous stem cell transplant. This option could potentially add several more years of life in partial/full remission. Unfortunately the cancer will come back and I will get that palliative final round of chemo. I chose the stem cell option and started the process 3 months ago with an oral chemo drug to kill cancer cells. I had a high dose of infusion chemo this past Friday and started daily injections on Sunday to create new stem cells in my bone marrow that will be moved to my blood stream for harvesting in two weeks. It will take up to 4 days to harvest the stem cells and then frozen until transplant day. I will then go into the hospital for extreme chemotherapy to kill off my immune system (red and white blood cells and platelets) for a medical “rebirth” where my harvested stem cells will be transplanted back into my bloodstream for engraphment into my bone marrow. So again, I am just telling my BTS family and friends while asking for your prayers and well wishes as I complete this new medical journey so that I can see my beloved BTS boys in concert next year. The good news is my initial prognosis was for years. I was diagnosed at 51 and I will be 61 on Saturday, one day after our beloved Jimin drops his new album of love songs!

Despite being formed with no Australian mail subsidy and a dominant competitor in P&O, the Orient Line survived its early formation and thrived. Above: Chris and Rob on board Pacific Adventure in . Orient Line survived two world wars, the Great Depression and stormy seas – carrying everything from mail to royalty, troops to tourists. The stories of Orient Line’s contribution to the Australian war effort are remarkable. A few years ago, Rob, Doug, Rachelle and I wrote a book about this unique line .

After the advent of jet aircraft, P&O reorganised their services, offering pleasure cruises. Throughout their cruising history P&O has operated some of the most famous passenger ships of all time, including the Oriana and Canberra . In Australia, P&O was the first to offer regular local cruises, and held a near monopoly during the ’s and ’s with their ship the Fairstar .

non-terminal,"center> View this post on Instagram A post shared by 지국🤍국민 ) So Fake Love by BTS was about love that was destined but ended up being fake. I think WHO is a similar concept. Jimin is singing about Who is the Love has his heart, but has yet to find her. However, with all the hints, clues and symbolism of the LGTBQ community, I believe he is saying society, fans etc. expect him to find a woman, but he has already found the love of his life in JK. He gives a subtle nod with the billboard screen that fell that showed his eyes. Also the phrase Keep Going on the screen coupled with the led screen for JK’s Coming Soon for Cinema has similarities. Is there a correlation? OT7 and vmin say the eyes are Tae. But there is no mole. I think they are JK and Jimin has subtly done what he and JK wanted to do; show they are in love, they are partners, they are each other’s ride and die! They enlisted together and they vacation together. They mentioned GCFT and they talk about we will see the real JM and JK. Will it be bro-code? Yes, but their chemistry and togetherness will come through! Love these two and Jimin has a brilliant album that talks about being in love. * After watching the video multiple times and reading analysis with others, I have come up with more clues. I left this comment on a post on some site. If you go back and watch the video, it appears most of it is in a dream state or parallel world. At the very beginning you actually hear all the sounds the ambient sounds such as the car driving by, car horns, people walking. Then he starts singing and all the ambient sounds go away. There are mechanics working in the background and you don’t hear any of that. They are ignoring all the dancers. Then the next sound you hear is the billboard dropping with JK’s eye (Tae has a mole under his eye. Then back to this alternate/parallel world with no ambient noise. There are glitches in the video, you have fake tornado’s and fireworks that you don’t hear. Cars turning over. No sound. Then after his last verse, who is my heart waiting for, he is walking and you hear all the ambient noise again. His footsteps, the cars, sirens. Back to reality. He is walking that red line that JK walked in Standing Next to You. I believe he is singing about what society expects of him regarding a relationship. Being with a girl. However, the whole promo and album is lgbtq coded. All the other songs are love songs as if he is already in love with someone. Jimin through his music, paintings, photo books has been telling us he supports and/or is part of the community. Many believe JM and JK have been in a relationship for years. There are plenty of clues from the promo as well. Muse is about what inspired Jimin to find love. He clearly sings about it. He co-wrote all the songs except WHO. He told the writer what he wanted to convey. Jimin and JK are doing as much as they can get away with confirming who they are and what they mean to each other. In the song Who, he never identifies a women who has his heart. He walks away. This song is so coded, but for those who don’t want to see or can’t see, the song fits his pop persona where people of all genders love his songs and can relate. No different than Ricky Martin, George Micheal singing to and about women. But we all know they eventually came out. Yet, they would still sing love songs between men and women. Sam Smith and Troy Sivoan went the route of singing about gay love As we know, both JK and JM love them both, especially Troy.",tumblr

non-terminal,"Verify by : bilal-salah0 : Our lives before the genocide were not perfect, to say the least, but we were happy and hopeful. Our dreams were and are still bigger than the walls, barbed wire, and tanks surrounding us but today we find ourselves in a situation where hope keeps being dimmed by constant humiliation and unprecedented injustice. The adults in my family are barely holding on. They’re doing their best but what is our children’s fault? What did they do to deserve such unbearable suffering at a very young age? When will this nightmare end? Will I be able to see them all someday safe, sound, happy and thriving like all children should? Such cruel neverending questions keep haunting me night and day. What we seek, above all, is not only to live in safety but also with dignity which is a basic human right we have always been denied. whenever I see Omar and Salah’s pictures in our beautiful home that was leveled to the ground, I can’t help but compare them to the state they’re in now; struggling to survive in a flimsy, airless makeshift tent surrounded by rubble, all sorts of disease-carrying insects, the stench of sewage floods and garbage, and the smell of death everywhere only made worse by the sweltering summer heat. The newborns’ and the children’s innocent faces amidst such misery won’t leave my thoughts. They fill me with grief and rage because of how helpless I am. Seeing the kids smile and hold their heads up high, despite all the suffering and fear their little hearts have to go through every single day, is pure torture. Their childhood games have been replaced by waiting in long lines for food and water and carrying containers, sometimes heavier than their fargile malnourished bodies. Most of their playgrounds, kindergartens and schools have been reduced to dust and rubble, and the ones left are still being bombed allowing them no respite or refuge from the horrors of the war. For almost ten months now, our little angels have been enduring hardships beyond their years; ripped from the safety and warmth of their home and everything they knew and loved and forced into a life of pain and peril where only the unknown awaits them. Your support is our only ray of hope amidst such a dire and bleak situation. My family and especially our children need you now more than ever as the airstrikes, starvation, and water and health crises are only intensifying and we are being further humiliated and annihilated. I never wanted it to come to this. I used to think I could handle everything myself but I truly have no choice but to ask for help now. Please help me protect my family and bring them closer to the life of safety and dignity they deserve as all humans do, wherever they are.

I always try the truthful route first but if that gets me nowhere. thehmn : I’m a strong proponent of lying to get the help you need. I always try the truthful route first but if that gets me nowhere? Lying it is. I think it’s important to respect other people’s time, wellbeing and money so I don’t do it in situations where I know I’m in the wrong, like if I want to get into a place just for fun and someone could get in trouble for letting me in wrongfully I’d rather not. But sometimes people just don’t understand why something is important in your situation so you have to turn it into something they understand. When I lived in England I constantly lied about being pregnant so gas station employees would let me use their bathroom because for some reason they didn’t have public bathrooms. Or when my doctor’s secretary couldn’t get it into her head that my stomach pains were very serious and concerning and insisted I couldn’t get an appointment this month so that evening I “found” a lump that I was pretty sure was nothing but it meant I had a reason to call her the next day and get a new appointment immediately and when the doctor told me the lump was harmless I could tell her what my real problem was and she immediately scheduled ALL the tests and examinations because she understood how concerning it was. I just had to get past the fucking secretary with a lie. Fuck I even support that elderly man who lied about having four children who were stuck in a house during a flood but when the rescue team got there in a dinghy they realized it was four dogs. The guy knew he had to lie because he was too sick to help them himself (able bodied people in the area were able to save their own pets) and they wouldn’t have helped him if they knew it was “just dogs. In the video the rescue team can be seen choking up and padding him on the back while he cries with his scared dogs in his arms. The team is clearly not mad because they can see how important the dogs are to him but I have no doubt he was right in thinking they wouldn’t have helped if he had told them the truth. So do what ya gotta do and lie lie lie.",tumblr

non-terminal,"Members Supporting Jimin and his phenomenal success of MUSE Members Supporting Jimin and his phenomenal success of MUSE I will equivocally state that I am a jikooker with Jimin as my bias, but I support ALL members with my money (buying albums, digital downloads, merch, fan club, concerts) and time (streaming, blogs, IG, TikTok. But, i don’t understand for the life of me the antics of one member. This is Jimin’s promotional weekend and there has not been one ounce of support for Jimin and his album release from Taehyung. Yet most of the other members (Suga does not promote while enlisted) have congratulated JM and shown their support. I expect to see a tiktok post from JK soon, as he did for Hobi and RM. But why has Tae not supported this album release of Muse just like he never supported FACE? What he does instead is release a promo for his photo book during Jimin’s promo period. Actually, i was ok with it, because it was not music, but a personal photo project I saw as a gift to Army on Army day. But today, in the middle of tracking and charting for Jimin, along with the trailer for JM/JK travel show releasing later today, he decides to post a photo of him and JK in Hawaii stating: JK will come quickly because he asked him to and missed him. What was the point of this post? Why is he feeding the taekookers who have been dragging Jimin relentlessly since the announcement of the travel show and the drop of his album. A large group of people who are actively working against Jimin by supporting other acts just to try and hold back Jimin. Mind you, JK is not getting the hate. I am not saying a member has to publish on social media to show support, but he did for other members and never for Jimin. That whole show where they hugged each other on Jin’s discharge was very touching, but now feels so disingenuous. Help me understand what is going on and why this seems to continually happen. Last year, JK would come back and provide context to everything that Tae said that put taekookers on a roll. Like Jimin, he has pretty much been absent from social medial and can’t do lives. Do I believe, they are all friends? Yes! But are they all as close to each equally, obviously not and that is understandable. Tae is closer to his wooga squad than he is most of the members of BTS. But even taking the whole shipping aspect away from jikook, i would still feel Tae’s actions should be questioned, simply because what he does over and over again is to rile up the toxic members of his fanbase and taekookers to hate on Jimin. We saw how bad it got last year with the death threats and reports to the Ministry of Defense from JK solos and taekookers. It is bad now with Jimin’s album release and travel show with JK. What does it take to be supportive like the other members or just simply be quiet this weekend? This is not a hate post towards Tae, but a post calling out a behavior that has negative connotations towards Jimin, his supposed soulmate.

I know why I stream and buy and share tutorials and vote like an unhinged obsessed person, even though I have crazy work and school deadlines. It’s because this very kind-hearted, highly intelligent, extremely talented, breathtakingly humble young man needs to know. He needs to KNOW his Hot wasn’t a fluke. It wasn’t bots. It wasn’t stream farms. It wasn’t random luck. He needs to know that no matter how many haters (online or in the industry) try and mess with him, we have his back. We will show up. Next week, during that short window of time when soldiers get to look at their cell phones, he should lie down on his bed, open up that screen, check to see how things went, perhaps a little nauseated with nerves… And see nothing but pure love and triumph! High charting. Sales that make him untouchable. Reviews that rave about his vision and his skill. He should know in the marrow of his bones. The thousands of hours of practice, of going back to the basics, of having a hand in every element of design, the physical and mental strain, the raw, aching fatigue–it was all worth it. He’s seen. He’s appreciated. He’s understood. I do all this because I want a good person to KNOW they are loved for being good. That despite all the corruption and heartache in this world, good things still happen to good people. I don’t want to brag to antis or other kpop stans. I don’t want to crow about Jimin’s accolades because I feel superior or more powerful. I don’t want to feel like *I* accomplished something, here. I want to be able to sleep peaceful when this done, sure that we all did our best, gave every inch, crossed every barrier, stayed the course and kept going… All to get Jimin safely landed so securely in success that no one questions his value or his artistic choices ever again – least of all him.

WITH YOU WITH YOU WITH YOU - love this part Showtime acts like a seamless transition to SGMB tho. Could easily be the soundtrack of a little scene on some adventure movie, his voice at the end is so cute. I’m glad he had so much fun! SGMB - honestly this song is truly just so postive. No matter what your musical preferences are, this song is what he wants to portray in all his happy bubbly self. It truly is a different from the rest type of track. I could tell he was so proud and loved the add-libs he did throughout the song. Slow dance - I JUST KNEW their voices together would go super well on this track, she just has that type of specific voice that blends so well with jimins. The way for a moment I couldn’t distinguish the voices at the end. I WAS WAITING like my life depended on it for the saxophone part, wish it was even longer Be Mine - It should be illegal to go this hard on a song, It is simply not allowed.

Costa Cruises was expanding its fleet in the s, and the introduction of the Costa Victoria in brought in an array of new amenities for the brand. Costa Victoria was built at Bremer Vulcan yard in Germany. At 75,gt, the ship featured large public spaces, multiple balcony cabins and a large on deck entertainment zone to their shipboard amenities. The ship was the first in the Victoria-class, and was expected to have a sister ship, named Costa Olympia. Costa Olympia was laid down at the same German shipyard, but while the ship was being built the shipyard went bankrupt. This threw the building of Costa Olympia into disarray, which was only 35% complete at the time! What was built was launched in October - to clear the slipway - and Costa Olympia’s incomplete hull was immediately laid up for long term storage. The ongoing shipyard issues led Costa to abandon their plans to take delivery of Costa Olympia. Becoming Norwegian Sky: The s saw Norwegian Cruise Line implement growth plans of their own. NCL purchased Costa Olympia’s incomplete hull in and had it towed to the Lloyd Werft Yard in Bremerhaven, Germany, in early . What had already been built was incorporated into a modified design, with design works overseen by the same firm that had been working on Costa Olympia. The ship was ultimately launched as Norwegian Sky. Bigger than Costa Victoria, the 78,gt ship entered service for NCL in . The design was considered to be successful enough to warrant NCL to order two additional ships in the class. The second NCL vessel was launched as Norwegian Sun. NCL’s third order was ultimately cancelled. With Costa Victoria now scrapped, only Norwegian Sky and Norwegian Sun remain, but continue as popular members of the NCL fleet.",tumblr

In a statement to People magazine , the actress revealed her breast cancer diagnosis, stating that she was “undergoing treatment” and that she was suing a firm and its former business manager for causing her to lose her health insurance due to a failure to pay the insurance premiums. According to reports , in a lawsuit Doherty shared that she hired a firm for tax, accounting, and investment services, among other things, and that part of their role was to make her health insurance premium payments to the Screen Actors Guild; Doherty claimed that their failure to make the premium payments in caused her health insurance to lapse until the re-enrollment period in . When Doherty went in for a checkup in March of , the cancer was discovered, at which time it had spread. In the lawsuit, Doherty indicated that if she had insurance, she would have been able to get the checkup sooner—the cancer would have been discovered, and she could have avoided chemotherapy and a mastectomy. Under the IRS, actors are often classified as independent contractors, which comes with its own set of challenges. Although it is unclear what Doherty’s situation was, for many independent contractors, obtaining health insurance can be difficult. Trying to get health insurance as an independent contractor can be a costly and convoluted process. A Actors’ Equity Association survey indicated that “more than 80% of nonunion actors and stage managers in California have been misclassified as independent contractors” A research study revealed that self-employment (which is what independent contractors are considered to be) was associated with a higher likelihood of being uninsured. Doherty’s tragic situation invites a larger conversation about healthcare access and equity in the United States. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , the Affordable Care Act (ACA, also known as “Obamacare” was signed into law in and revolutionized healthcare access in two distinct ways: “creating health insurance marketplaces with federal financial assistance that reduces premiums and deductibles and by allowing states to expand Medicaid to adults with household incomes up to percent of the federal poverty level” The ACA helped reduce the number of uninsured Americans and expanded healthcare access to those most in need. It also helped close gaps in coverage for different populations, including those with pre-existing health conditions, lower-income individuals, part-time workers, and those from historically excluded and marginalized populations. Despite strides made through the ACA, healthcare access and equity are still persistent issues, especially within marginalized communities. Research from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) examining data indicated that in , non-elderly American Indian and Alaska Natives (AIAN) and Hispanic people had the greatest uninsured rates (19.1% and 18% respectively. When compared with their white counterparts, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders (NHOPI) and Black people also had higher uninsured rates at 12.7% and 10, respectively. The Commonwealth Fund reported that between and , “states that expanded Medicaid eligibility had higher rates of insurance coverage and health care access, with smaller disparities between racial/ethnic groups and larger improvements, than states that didn’t expand Medicaid” It’s important to note that if a Republican president is elected, Project , the far-right policy proposal document, seeks to upend Medicaid as we know it by introducing limits on the amount of time that a person can receive Medicaid. When peeling back the layers to examine these racial and ethnic differences in more detail, the Brookings Institute noted in that the refusal of several states to expand Medicaid could be one contributing factor. One research study found that some underrepresented racial groups were more likely to experience insurance loss than their white counterparts. The study indicated that for Black and Hispanic populations, specific trigger events were more likely, as well as “socioeconomic characteristics” that were linked to more insurance loss and slower insurance gain. The study also noted that in the U.S, health insurance access was associated with employment and and marriage and that Black and Hispanic populations were “disadvantaged in both areas” Equity in and access to healthcare is fundamental, but bias is omnipresent. Age bias , for example, is a pervasive issue in breast cancer treatment. Research also indicates that racial bias is a prevalent issue—because the current guidelines in breast cancer screenings are based on white populations, this can lead to a delayed diagnosis for women from non-white communities. Our health is one of our greatest assets and healthcare should be a basic human right, no matter what state or country you live in. As a society, we must ensure that healthcare is available, affordable and accessible to all citizens. After all, how can a country call itself great if so many of its citizens, especially those most marginalized and vulnerable, don’t have access to healthcare?",tumblr

In a conversation with PEOPLE ahead of her first-ever art exhibition , Di Novi recalls how the late Doherty was “a budding broadcast TV star” when she came in to do a reading for Heathers , the teen cult classic in which she famously played Heather Duke. “I don’t think she quite knew what she was getting into” says the filmmaker, 68, noting that the movie featured “such an odd script, especially for the time” — especially compared to projects Doherty had done up until that point like Little House on the Prairie . But that didn’t last long. As Di Novi explains, “Then she got so into it … she was smart as a whip and had been acting a lot, and she just really got into that very specific dialogue” “She had some of the best lines in the movie, and she did such a great job” Di Novi continues. “She’s just this little, tiny spitfire” For the painter and producer, Doherty, who died at age 53 on July 13 , was one of a group of “a few people that are just born with a certain spirit” and embodied it from an early age. “They don’t have to mature into it — they just kind of have that, whatever it is” Di Novi adds. “She had so much presence for such a tiny person. … And even at 15 years old, she just came in and was like a little bulldozer” Doherty's longtime publicist Leslie Sloane confirmed the Beverly Hills, star’s death in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE on July 14. “It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty” she said. “On Saturday, July 13, she lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease” Two days after Doherty’s death, her Heathers costar Lisanne Falk shared a tribute on social media that included clever references to the film. “If her portrayal of Heather Duke were to serve as her epitaph, I, for one, as the last remaining Heather would think it more than sufficient” wrote Falk, 59. “Certainly no one else could have landed the line: ‘Veronica, why are you pulling my dick’ like Shannen did” She also referenced the death of her and Doherty’s costar Kim Walker at age 32 back in , writing, “Tragically, Heather Chandler never had the chance to reflect, and now Heather Duke was interrupted just as she was clearing her throat” “If it is Heather McNamara’s fate to have the last word for the Heathers, then let it be this: It’s been an honor to occupy our own little patch of the zeitgeist, together as one, out here on the fringe, where all the cool kids hang, a cult classic” Falk continued. “Thank you, Heather. And Heather. ” she added, using heart emojis in the signature colors of her, Walker and Doherty’s croquet-loving characters. “May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, Shannen. You always had the balls, didn’t you? For better or worse, no more pulling your dick”",tumblr

non-terminal,"Shannen Tribute by friends and co-stars, from ""Let's Be Clear"" Shannen Tribute by friends and co-stars, from “Let’s Be Clear” I complied these from the next-to-last “Let’s Be Clear” podcast episode . The podcast launched last year ) by Shannen Doherty: Holly Marie Combs: I think Shannen would be really pleasantly surprised by the outbaring of love and emotion that has come from so many different people in places, because she really did often feel like the underdog and vilified, and that she had to prove herself in so many different ways. I think she’d be really surprised and shocked by how many people have reached out and said really beautiful things about her. It’s just a testament to who she was as a person. I’m angry and I’m sad she doesn’t get to see the places that she wanted to. And I’m angry and sad that once again I’ve lost, you know, that person that you can call in the middle of the night, to cancer. I’ve lost another friend to cancer. And it’s really hard when you lose someone who should have and really wanted to live along in full life, not just for herself, but for other people in her family. You know, when I went through tough times in my life, some really horrible stuff, and one day I showed up on her door step, and I didn’t know how bad I looked physically until I saw it on her face, and I saw her face change, and I knew I must have been pretty beat up. To her credit, she never shied away, she never took a step back, and if something was wrong, she went full end to help me fix it. And I think that’s because she had seen so much pain and trauma in her own life that she didn’t want to see anybody else go through it. And whether it was me or my kids. She was literally always a phone call away. It’s so unbelievable that, even knowing she was sick, we just thought we had more time. And she definitely did think she had more time. So I guess for me, that’s the lesson is that you think you have time, but you don’t. And not many people could do what Shannen did in one day. She was just like a tornado of energy. But I think that’s the thing to take away from all of this is you think you have time, and so you know, she would give me an awful hard time that I don’t say I love you enough. To anyone. It’s not on a like you know, personal oasis, but to anyone in general. And so I would say, you know, tell the people you love that you love and live like there is no tomorrow , because that’s what she did. Brian Krause: When I got on the show Charmed, I was really nervous to show up and perform in front of her. I knew the stakes were raised that you know, I had heard rumors and blah blah blah. And I got on, I knew my lines, I did my thing, and she just looked over me and she kind of gave a little wink in a good job, and you know, to get her approval that I had formed well and done well. It meant everything. I was told I was going to be a regular on the show , it was actually Shannen who had said to me, because when you had powers on Charmed, you usually were a bad guy and you died. And she took me aside and she said, no, you’re a good guy, and you’re going to stick around, and you just keep doing what you’re doing and you’ll be around for a while. And it was her way of saying, you know, good job , keep showing up and keep kicking ass and kind of joining me, opening her wings and allowing me to be a part of her family . And I was so honored by it that Charmed had this “let’s kick some ass” and make really good entertainment, and that was all Shannen … setting the standard of what professionalism was. And I’ll never forget it . And I’ve been so lucky the last few years to have gotten to know her as we’ve done comic cons and this podcast, and to know Shannen is a human and her enduring spirit of anything is possible . And if I could say anything to “Let’s be clear” fans, Shannen really believed anything was possible with hard work, determination and vision, let’s go get it. And I don’t think I ever should heard her say I don’t know how, or oh what if, or it can’t. It wasn’t a part of her DNA, it was “oh, we’ve run into a wall. Okay, let’s fix this, let’s get this done, let’s do this. No, let’s take action. And I think anything I could pass on that rubbed off on me that meant so much was our work ethic and desire to do what she wanted to do and live fearlessly. And I’m going to take that with me and try and do it every day, every day, every day. I love Shannen so much and I wish I got a chance to tell her that she’s an amazing, amazing human being… I just feel really lucky that I was able to be a part of . I’m forever grateful for her friendship . Drew Fuller: In honor of her, Let’s be very clear: Shannen was a warrior. She faced adversity head on with everything that she got and refused to be a victim. She lived her life with so much passion, with love and a fearlessness that I will strive daily to replicate. She’s inspired, hired millions of people, She’s inspired me, and I will love her forever, and I hope each and every one of you listening will honor her spirit by living the way she lived. Dorian Gregory: I remember her with a smile and the laughter and the joy that we shared together , and that way it will live forever. I was impacted by that. First thing on set. I heard this amazing laughter. I looked around the corner and it was Holly and Shannen sharing a moment having such genuine, real laughter. I walked over first days awkward, she welcomed me warmly, and that was and then a lot. I come from a house of strong women to turn. Accomplished and sharp as sharks, sharp as sharkingby. That was her. My father passed from cancer, and my mother passed with cancer. So I have a little idea of what happens on the day to day. I say this: because I remember Shannen a year ago and her autographs on me. It’s the last time I actually was there physically around her and her wit and her warmth and her energy and her strength just as strong as ever, and her generosity and care for her fans… In every convention I’ve been with her, every time i’ve been in her presence. A week ago we did a podcast and Shannen was sharing her years of experience in this distance and the ins and outs, and the ups and downs, and her artistic affectionism, and that was so wonderful to hear . James Eckhouse: You were a ferocious spirit. You were ferocious in your work, your talent. You’re ferocious in your love. You’re ferocious in your courageous battle with cancer . I really loved working with you both as actor and director. Yeah, you always brought all of your heart to every scene. And when I brought my young kids to the set, I’m forever grateful to you for being so welcoming, so kind. They never forgot. We honor you and we treasure you. You will be sorely missed. Mark Damon Espinoza: Our storylines were always going in different directions, and I’m really sorry we didn’t have more opportunities to actually work together on screen. She was a terrific actress. However, when we did pass on the set at the studio wherever we were, you know, make up, trailer or wardrobe or whatever. She was always really really nice to me. And at the time, it would have been very easy for me to be intimidated. You know, I was working with some of, if not the most famous young people on the planet at that time. They didn’t have to be nice. Shannen was, however. And I’ll always remember that. Years after , she was shooting something at the gym where I was working out… and I was a mess. I was just coming from a run and I was sweaty, but she saw me from a good distance away and stopped production, came over to me, gave me this huge hug and wanted to know how I was doing. And she didn’t let me go until I told her. I mean, not everyone would hug a sweaty guy at the gym after they’ve been in hair and makeup and and have a crew waiting. But that that’s Shannen, and I’ll keep in my heart, you know. That’s that’s the one I’ll remember for the rest of my my own life. None of us are immortal, and our time is far too short. Hers was far, far too short. But her energy, her her fight, her spirit, that’ll live on. That’ll live on. Shenae Grimes: I owe more to Shannen than I’m sure she ever knew, than most people know. If it weren’t for Shannen, I would not be who I am in so many more ways than one. I had the good fortune of being cast on the spin off series of ” in , playing the character Annie Wilson, who was part of the brother’s sister duo that moved from a small town to Beverly Hills. And the only reason why that happened is because Shannen Doherty created one of the most iconic characters ever to be on television in my opinion, and I think a lot of people would agree with me on that one. Shannen Doherty created the character that we all fell in love with. I had the incredible fortune of stepping into a tiny version of her shoes and hopefully follow into her footsteps in a way that made Shannen proud. Because Shannen was so warm and so lovely and so fiercely strong and unapologetic, and she is the type of woman that I have always aspired to be. And it was watching her do it despite everything that she was met with and continue to forge ahead, being true to who she was that gave me the confidence to do the same , no matter how much resistance I’ve been met with throughout my life. Because of that, and there, I’ve said it before, there’s really not been much of a blueprint for how to be a strong, unapologeticly strong woman in a world and society that is so determined to tell you not to. But she did it. She did it, and she, as far as I’m concerned, is one of the very few that is the blueprint. It’s women like Shannen Doherty that give the rest of us permission and confidence to demand what we deserve, stand up for ourselves, and not take any shit . And I hope I’m allowed to say that, but I think Shannen would be okay with it. In my short time of getting the job on ” and starting to film and being a part of the tabloid fodder and media craze that was at that time, it was only a little why into that process and that experience that I met Shannen and had the privilege to actually work with her portraying the character of Brenda alongside me on . And at that point, already in just a short window of time, I had been so mentally broken down by the experience. You know, I was eighteen when I moved out to La to take on the job. I was by myself, left my family back home, really didn’t know anybody other than my cast. And the behind the scenes drama that “Beverly Hills, ” was known for definitely was recreated behind the scenes of our spinoff of ” as well. And I think Shannen and I am not having ever spoken about it, but I think a lot of our experiences, or the experiences I had, mirrored a lot of the experiences that she had. Meeting her that day in the trailer, I was so exciting because she was my favorite character from the original show. I had watched it with my mom growing up, so I was a super fan of her already, and I think, you know, brown hair like, she was the gorgeous brunette for the show, so I felt most like tied to her, and I was so nervous meeting her, and she literally just like welcomed me into her trailer with the biggest smile and the warmest hug, and it was like I don’t even know if she meant to communicate this with her hug, but it made me feel so seen and like I was not alone in everything that I was experiencing at that time, because it was a lot. It was a lot for an eighteen nineteen year old girl to go through. And getting that hug from her, knowing that she experienced so much at times a million when she was my age, like, was everything to me because all I saw with this was this beautiful, strong woman who was so resilient, who had made it out of that experience still with her chin held high, fire in her belly and being true to who she was, and to me, that was Shannen Doherty. The queen of the Badasses that give us all permission and confidence to be who we are, to demand respect, and to never settle for anything less tan what we deserve. David Lascher: I always admired her for being such a strong woman. She knew what exactly what her voice was. She didn’t pander to anybody. My scenes weren’t with Shannen, and she was a tough nut to crack, to be honest, she was guarded . But then we became friends. She had this soft side to her that I think a lot of people didn’t know, and she was a beautiful soul, and to see such a strong person have to fight the fight that she went through was so heartbreaking and I really thought she was winning. And I’m just so sad and heartbroken, and I love her soul and I hope she’s at peace . Randy Spelling: Ever since I saw that smile on “Little House on the Prairie” it just lit up the screen. And Shannen lit up the screen, every screen that she was on. She lit up a room, every room that she was in. She just had this energy about her, and she was small and she was slight, but she just had such a big presence and energy that you could feel tough at times, soft and sweet at times. Shannen, you will be so missed. You will always be my first legitimate crush. And I know you were greeted by so many loved ones. Thank you for being you and for being so committed to that which you believed in and showing that to the world. No matter what it was, you had this incredible commitment and tenacity and drive and passion to go after what it is that you believed in. Dean Butler: When we met Shannen for the first time at the beginning of season nine of “Little House on the Prairie, she made a very strong impression . And that impression there were a couple of things. One, she was talented. There was no doubt that Shannen had a gift. And the other thing that you couldn’t miss about Shannen is that Shannen was determined to make something of herself in the entertainment industry. She had one of the most powerful motors in that area that I’ve ever seen in all the years that I’ve been around our industry. Shannen left us way too soon, but not unlike someone else that she and I both worked with on “Little House, Michael Landon, who died at the age of fifty four from pancreatic cancer. Shannen fit a lot of life into her fifty three years, and she will be remembered for it. Kevin Smith: Shannen broke the Internet before the Internet even existed. She’s an American icon. When I went to work on ‘Clerks, when we went to Minnesota to shoot the movie, it was almost as if you know the business, Hollywood whatever, you know, I’d arrived with my first movie, but here I was about to take make my second movie, first with the studio, first with a real budget. And the first person from the industry to meet me over this bridge that I crossed thanks to making 'Clerks, the first person in the business of professional who was there to welcome me was Shannen. And I always found that wonderful and bittersweet and ironic that I spent so many nights watching her on this little television grainy TV, and then I saw her in all her glory in real life, no grain whatsoever. I had a crush on her then I’ll always have a crush on her. S he was a force of nature. One month since your departure. Forever missed. Never gone, never forgotten.",tumblr

Obviously Nick and Charlie’s relationship growth is beautiful, and Charlie’s mental health stuff is SO IMPORTANT, and I was SOBBING at Episode 4. HOWEVER. Breakdown of my favourite parts / storylines: 1. Darcy’s exploration of pronouns and gender identity. Seeing them start leaning more masc, cutting their hair, using they/them pronouns, and then coming out to Tara as non-binary? WONDERFUL. As someone who recently came out as genderqueer (with a fairly similar path as Darcy actually) this made me so emotional and so happy for them and the representation. 2. Isaac. My baby. Everything about him is so wonderful and I just want to wrap him in the biggest hug ever. His coming out scenes (both his one to Charlie and to the Paris Gang) were beautiful. His boundaries in refusing to fill in the gaps for his friends is so admirable, as when you’re outside the ‘mainstream’ queer labels it can become such a tiresome ordeal having to explain your identity to others when they aren’t putting in the work to look it up. I’m SO GLAD he got these moments and he’s such a ray of sunshine. Him being the only one to see that something was wrong with Charlie hurt me deeply but it made me love him even more. Also seeing his cheeky side when it comes to Charlie’s sex life is peak aro/ace romance obsessed behavior. 3. Michael Holden my beloved. Darragh’s portrayal of him is everything - he’s so funny, awkward, and optimistic in every single scene and I just adore him. All of his interactions with Charlie made me fall in love with him even more, and they all just felt so RIGHT. His and Tori’s relationship is wonderful. 4. Tori being the best most beautiful big sister. She has so much love in her but she’s so afraid of letting people in and see her being vulnerable. Her love and anxiety for Charlie is so immense, but she does what she can even when her heart is breaking. I adore her and I’m so looking forward to seeing even more of her in the next season. 5. Nick interacting with Elle, Tara and Imogen on the road trip! I love seeing Nick integrate more with that friend group, but allowing him to have those moments of gossip and banter with the girls is beautiful, especially as he’d said previously how he didn’t talk about the deeper stuff with his other friends. Having the girls encourage him to talk - especially Elle causing chaos - was *chefs kiss. 6. Tao and Nick hugging! 7. Charlie, Tao and Isaac’s friendship! I adore seeing them be super huggy and telling each other how much they love each other. Healthy friendships for the win! No toxic masculinity here! 8. Tao and Elle’s relationship & his utter adoration of her. The scene where he showed her the video he made of her was so emotionally raw and beautiful and UGH IM OBSESSED 9. Mr Farouk and Mr Ajayi’s soft moments UGH I LOVE THEM. Mr F is one of my fave TV teachers - the way he tells Charlie that he could help so many younger students and you can just tell how much he needed queer rep when was younger! Ugh I adore these two so much.",tumblr

I can’t look at the twitter link but the following comments seem to think this isn’t an accurate description of what’s happening: What about we don’t take the government that is trying to take away our rights at their fucking word? They say this shit so people like you say this and so we don’t take it seriously enough to fight back. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE PROPER MEDICAL TRANSITION FUNCTIONALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND REPLACE IT WITH CONVERSION THERAPY. Just like they did with children basically, that’s the alternative we’ll eventually be offered. And they will be calling it a better version of transgender care. Do you get that? I am begging you people to not believe what a plainly transphobic and hostile government tells you. Open your eyes and actually see what they’re doing. Take this fucking seriously. If you don’t believe me, at least remember what I said after the Levy report comes out and things get much worse for trans adults in the months afterwards. The twitter account in my original post has been locked for non-followers due to harassment atm I believe. This is a thread of someone else in the same situation in reddit. There’s been many more reports there of the same thing happening to other trans people. The review is deffinately in our favour that’s why the law was changed specifically to steal data that would otherwise be illegal to collect so that they can pretend the majority of transitions are “unsuccesful” because most of us don’t have GRCs (which they have intentionally kept hard to get even after repeated calls to fix the process) I swear people have the memory of a goldfish when it comes to politics ALT View on Twitter This is being taken to the UN.

I’m not sure if you missed the first time I asked for extra information, but here it is incase you were skim reading: No need to be passive agressive when I told you already AND THEN you tried to tell me I was wrong. Also it’s on 2 persons tweets as well as being circulated elsewhere. I have repeatedly tried to explain things to you which you have then dismissed, don’t go acting all reasonable just because it’s in reblogs instead of replies now. I can post that what is in the replies if you think I don’t have the right to be angry at someone treating me with disrespect. Do you really think telling people “I strongly suggest you actually read up on the changes that have been happening” is explaining anything rather than saying “fuck off to google? Are you trying to say that evidence is easy to find if it’s on two people’s tweets and a couple of reblogs? Also you keep trying to say that I’m trying to discourage people from acting on what’s happening.

I wasn’t a fan of Musk, but I liked the idea of electric cars and I’ve always excelled at sales so I felt like it was worth considering. I arrived and chatted with the sales manager who said everyone started on phones before they could work their way up. I was a little wary of that as I’m not a phone person but she laughed and said, “Well, you know. We’re still just a startup, so everyone has to put in the hours” I stared at her in confusion. Tesla. A startup. In . What? I laughed a little and suggested that it was past that stage of growth but she doubled down and repeated it later. I remained baffled. After the interview she offered to let me talk to an employee to see how happy she was. I readily agreed. The manager left. I asked the employee how happy she was. She said that sometimes pay was late, that promotions were promised that didn’t manifest for months, but that overall she liked working there and cut them slack because they were still just a startup. I stared at her. It was like listening to a cultist repeating a phrase that was in direct contradiction with reality. I wanted to ask what she thought a startup was but I just thanked her for her time. I got offered both jobs, Tesla or jewelry. Jewelry offered four more dollars an hour. When I turned down the Tesla lady I kindly said that I didn’t feel there was as much job security in a startup.",tumblr

non-terminal,"everyone says join your local mutual aid groups and build community, but uh, what do you do if a lot of them seem to have. riverlight82 : fruityshirts : luulapants : theophages : everyone says join your local mutual aid groups and build community, but uh, what do you do if a lot of them seem to have dissolved and the other ones don’t have consistent recurring meetings. this is real, and it’s a thing that a lot of people are going to run into in the fact of calls to “get involved” especially if they’re people who haven’t been deeply involved in their communities before. so here’s what I can share: You can’t expect it to be built for you already. Community organizing has fallen apart in a lot of places. That means you may need to be the one to start it. Someone has to. Your presence will matter. Local community networks are SMALL. That means that every single person has an outsized presence and an outsized absence. One person dropping off the map can feel catastrophic, but that also means that one person stepping up can make all the difference. Find a center. Any community group needs a steady base. That can be a physical location - that’s why coffeehouses were historically such effective grounds for building political and creative movements. It can also be a person or people who are consistent and reliable. If one person shows up to make space for work on a regular basis, they’ll be there when the second person shows up. They’ll be there for the third. That’s how it starts. Play secretary. A lot of activist groups are starving for some basic admin support. Maybe you’re not up for being the leader, but maybe you can organize the Google drive. Maybe you can be the one that keeps phone numbers. There’s a lot of unsexy shit work out there that needs to be done. Count your eggs before you start baking. There is an economics of labor to why activism circles have shrunk. Be mindful of the time and hands you have available when deciding what work you’re able to take on. Build tolerance, build coalitions. Small organizing means you can’t afford to fracture over every little disagreement. Decide your mission and your values from the start, the things that are non-negotiable, and don’t get hung up on the rest. Be prepared to work with people you don’t like. Focus on the task at hand. Network! Know what other related or like-minded projects are out there, whether they are groups like yours in other areas or groups in your community who are doing work that intersects with yours. Be there for people. Step up. Offer to help. Even outside an organizing structure, if you become the kind of person who shows up and helps, people will remember you and they will reach out to you when need arises. If you’ve spent any time organizing, you’ll know numbers 4 and 5 cannot be overstated. Number 5 is the biggest reason organizing groups don’t stick around. Organizing is work. You’re asking people to do a job outside of their job. It’s important to commit to WAY LESS than you want to. It’s also SO important that someone is the documentarian. This is why a lot of the work doesn’t get passed on when the initial group of folks burns out. These points are also good litmus tests if you’re looking to join a group. If they’re committing to a lot, and expect a lot from you, try setting some clear boundaries about what you can do sustainably. If there’s major push back and/or shaming for suggesting to do less…RUN. That group will burn you out SO quick. Similarly if they don’t have any documentation then they haven’t paused to do the boring structural work that is necessary to keep a group going. The thing about requests to “get involved” and “stay engaged” is, they don’t often really tell you how to do that. And, as OP points out, even if you’re lucky enough to live in a place where there’s some community infrastructure already in place (like mutual aid groups) these are often small, disorganized, or out of energy. And that’s because community organizing is a skill ! It’s not a skill many of us have, and it’s not a skill most of us are taught—but it’s a skill you can learn like any other. There’s an excellent article going around by Daniel Hunter that gives you a really quick intro to some of the ways organizers think—it’s strategic, practical, and goal-oriented. Marshall Ganz and the Leading Change Network is another excellent resource. (For those of you who remember Howard Dean’s primary campaign in ‘04, and its commitment to grass-roots/community-based organizing and small-dollar fundraising—it was rooted in Ganz’s work. And yes, I worked that campaign, mumblety-many years ago) I grew up with parents who were politically active and politically engaged—we talked politics, and we did (do) things like go to marches, sign petitions, and go to rallies. My dad took me to my first (and second, and third) anti-war rally during the Bush years. But as I’ve gotten older, I’ve learned that the kind of political engagement they taught me is important—but it isn’t really about getting things done . That’s community organizing. I’m still a neophyte at community organizing. It’s okay if you are too! Many of us weren’t taught it, but it’s a skill that can be learned. , If you’re trying to find a way to “get involved” or find a mutual aid group but are struggling: the above commentary is excellent once you’ve found a group. If the question really is how to find a group—well, that’s a tough one! If you live in a bigger city, you can probably find some good starting points by googling “community organizing NYC” (or whatever. You also might check out the organizations on this list (sorry it’s a picture and not text—it’s from the former organizing arm of the Obama campaign) to see if they have any local chapters near you. If you’re in a small town (as I am) you might need to be more issue-focused. My town has a social services coordinator, and there’s a food-and-fuel fund for lower-income residents; see if your town has similar organizations and talk to the leaders. And—one more thing, if you’ll forgive the aside. You don’t have to do everything. If what you really care about is press freedom—or immigrant rights—or defending the separation of church and state—or climate action—or anti-racism activism—or union organizing—it’s okay to channel your energies towards just one cause. There’s a lot of work that’ll need to be done over the next four years. As notes, burnout is a real risk. Trust that you don’t have to do it all.

Its actually embarassing how little she knows about this shit. But hey, expecting a socialist to know about economics is like expecting a fish to know what a desert is. Much of the ocean is a desert You know what? Let’s use the allowance example again to make it even clearer. Let’s pretend we have an allowance tax bracket with a 70% tax on money received after a certain point. To keep things simple, we’ll make the limit $90. If a kid does chores and earns $10 in allowance, they get $10. They’re not going to be affected by the 70% tax. If a kid does chores and earns $50, they get $50. They also aren’t in the 70% tax bracket, even though they make five times as much money as the kid making $10. If a kid does chores and earns $ in allowance, then they’re in the allowance tax bracket with the 70% tax. $ minus $90 is $10. This is the part that’s going to be taxed 70. 70% of $10 is $7. So the kid getting $ in allowance will have $93 after the 70% tax takes its share. Now, I’d never impose such a thing on actual kids. All of this is a thought exercise. But if it were real, the kid making $10 and the kid making $50 would probably be kind of mad if the kid getting $93 was bitching about being short $7. Also AOC literally has a degree in economics. So anyone saying their highschool education gave them more economics knowledge than her really needs to rethink themselves. Your whiteness does not actually create expertise. they really thought they were cooking when they said they have the economics knowledge equivalent to a US high schooler",tumblr

non-terminal,"Holiday Shopping that fights period poverty for college students? Yep! Read on. ) nerdykeppie : Holiday Shopping that fights period poverty for college students? Yep! Read on. ) After the success of our June/Pride sales goal, where we managed to eliminate a lot of the debt we accumulated while I was unable to work earlier this year & stock up cash so we didn’t have to borrow for payroll during the fall lull and also donate to , we were considering where to focus on this year when a conversation I had with my mom pointed me in the direction of our charity for Holidays : the East Stroudsburg University Warrior Food Pantry , and specifically, stocking menstrual products at the pantry . Without getting too much into the weeds about the details - which I’ll talk about under the cut for those of you who are interested - here’s the pitch: we need to hit a gross sales goal of $45K in December in order to pay our bills and payroll basically until Pride starts up . Businesses like ours are very much feast or famine, and we’ve got to eat and we’ve got people whose paychecks depend on us having the cash to pay them. If we hit that goal, we’ll donate the equivalent of 1% of our net profit from the month of December in period products – tampons and pads, specifically, by request of the food pantry, and possibly reusable pads and menstrual cups, if the pantry wants that from us. (At the end of the day, this is about taking care of people the way they need, and we’ll listen to the pantry staff about what people are requesting) We’ve currently got our Bottoms & Tops sale going, too, so you can buy 2 tops or bottoms from the linked collection & get 69% off the 3rd item from that collection. Bottoms & Tops Sale! Okay, so for the long version whys and wherefores: My mom taught math at ESU for 35 years, and she and Dad now volunteer running the food pantry along with a couple of other people. ESU is a state school, and as such is one of the few remaining vaguely affordable schools in Pennsylvania. A lot of its students are self-supporting for one reason or another – many are “non-traditional/adult students, have kids, or don’t have families that can support them while they go to school. Mom & Dad have pushed to expand what the food pantry offers to personal care items, which has been difficult due to a bunch of boring stuff about money and state entities and also people thinking ‘that’s not food’ but Mom is stubborn about it, because – to paraphrase her – how can you focus on class when you feel gross? This struggle has been especially difficult for menstrual products, and way more so for tampons, because it’s a rather conservative area and… yeah. People get weird about it. I’ve been really broke, with a young kid, and reliant on food pantries, which rarely, if ever, have any menstrual products, let alone tampons. Period poverty is very real, and it sucks. Plus, I gotta tell you, if we can send a bunch of boxes of tampons and pads to the food pantry, well… Rumor has it this will help my mom win an argument over whether those items should be carried at all, because what are they gonna do, throw them out? They’re here! They’ve been donated! Wasting them would be terrible. ) So that’s the pitch, guys. Help me make a direct, measurable difference in the lives of people at the school where I went to winter swim team, the school that fed me growing up… and help my mom win an argument about making people’s lives better… and get your holiday shopping done while you do. ) We start counting sales from the minute I hit post. :P",tumblr

I’ve been through this many times before, I’ll do it again. It has just gotten easier to write than to talk now. While riding back home with some friends, one of them brought up a very good point: I dealt/deal with all of the fear, pain, and shame that cancer brings, so taking on smaller ordeals pale in comparison. And this was very much the case during the initial phase of my diagnosis. I, like so many folk, have depression that ranges from a fog to a typhoon. From still being able to laugh to wishing I stopped breathing. And during some of my cancer treatment, that largely stopped. Funnily enough, my suicidality was scared of the actual threat of death. My landlord had extended grace, a few family members and friends stepped up to support. I had things to be grateful for, including getting one of the more treatable versions of cancer and finally being able to feel almost normal on the non-chemo weeks. I was in maintenance mode and I did not have enough available resources for depression.exe to run. This did not last very long, even during treatment. I’m looking through my notes now and seeing how much I broke down during the latter half of treatment. I read over the note in August of how I was awake crying at 4 AM wishing my mother was still alive so I could talk to her about how much I was suffering, even through I never fully opened to her like that before she passed. And now I am left in remission, grateful for the status but struggling with everything that entails. The depression and self-loathing is back and stronger than ever, latching onto the physical and mental setbacks the diagnosis and treatment left. I feel disconnected from cancer patients and communities even though I am only a month-long survivor and am at the highest risk for recurrence. I feel incapable to re-enter the world as I, my landlord, and those that depend on me need me to. I am stuck in limbo, too broken to ascend and too well to descend. Throw in my growing feelings of dystopia around trying to get a job and what the rest of my life feels like it will feel like and I, in some ways, feel worse than when I was going through treatment. Like I went through the suffering to possibly have a future but I am too incompetent and afraid and depressed to actually have one. Is this just gonna be it? I get a job that pays just enough for me to lose my food and medical assistance and I can’t afford the treatment when I relapse? I’m stuck being this fat and stupid and looked down upon in my professional and personal life, as I should be?

And whatever is left is…also terrible. I did everything I was supposed to. I went to the doctor and got my scans. They found a “suspicious” spot but after an ultrasound I was cleared and worry-free. Eight months later I was diagnosed with Stage 3A Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. I was so angry, but mostly terrified. Everything about early diagnosis is awful. All of the scans and tests are incredibly painful, which I really didn’t expect. The biopsy consisted of me holding a young nurses hand and her crying with me while the doctor basically stabbed a nail through my breast to collect tumor tissue. It hurt so badly. Then, when I had my first MRI, I was lying face down but on a ramp with my breasts hanging down. Unnatural and also, of course, incredibly painful. I was just started to call out and ask them to please stop when Justin Bieber’s Stay came on the headphones and I didn’t feel all alone anymore. I knew that I immediately wanted my breasts gone. Both of them, gone. Immediately. It didn’t matter that my right breast hadn’t betrayed me, my killer left boob had made the decision for both of them. Two weeks after diagnosis I had my double mastectomy. I was so pitiful after that that I even made the nurses cry. I had a male nurse come in and check on me the next day and he told me he’d gone home crying. I must have been awful. Thankfully, I don’t remember it. I think most of it was because they wouldn’t let my (then) four year old in to see me. I did get to see my two older boys though, thank goodness. My friends dyed my hair a beautiful pink. I had never dyed my hair before and I was so happy with the outcome. I could have kept that beautiful color forever. I went straight into chemo. The Red Devil was every two weeks and at one point I remember sitting in my kitchen wondering if I was dying. I think I probably was. I was also bald now. No nose hair, no eyebrows or eyelashes, nothing. I looked like a turtle. But I was too sick to really care. I didn’t even mind the Neulasta shot every two weeks. I moved on into Taxol, and it was actually just as bad for me. During this time I was put into the ICU with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs (MANY, and was on oxygen for months. The night before I was hospitalized I told my middle son I felt like I was being stabbed in the back, but hey. It was just massive blood clots. *sigh* After chemo I found out that I now have Lymphedema. If you know what Lymphedema is, you know how terrible this is. If you don’t, let me just tell you- it’s so terrible. When I had my double mastectomy they also removed 39 of my lymph nodes under my left arm and six of them were cancerous. And now the fluid doesn’t drain from my arm and gets stuck in my arm and chest and neck and I am miserable. I did treatement and have a pump and wear sleeves and all that, but it is still miserable. At the end of chemo and beginning of radiation I bought a house. I want you to know I remember none of it. But I love it. ) I wasn’t expecting radiation to be bad but of course it was awful. Nothing about cancer is fun. The burns burned. The skin broke. The pain pained. My stomach did NOT stomach. It was truly terrible. After that I had a year of injections. And a total hysterectomy. And pills. And bone pain, depression, anxiety, nightmares, hot flashes, and, finally, heart surgery. It was a hell of a couple of years. And if they’d diagnosed it when I got my first mammogram, I don’t think half of it would have happened. What’s happening now, though, is that cancer never really left me. It’s always on my mind and in my thoughts. With every pain and ache I’m convinced it’s back to get me. I hope that this anxiety and fear eventually leave me. Please get your scans and check ups when they’re due. Take every step you need to take. You want to stick around, even when things look bleak. There’s always a better day coming.",tumblr

terminal,"So it's Lymphoma Awareness Week. And I’m gonna make you all aware ) Hodgkin's Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It affects the lymphatic system. Out of all the cancers to have, it’s a pretty curable cancer to have, with stages 1 and 2 being 93% cured after treatment. Though it get’s a little tricky in the advanced stages. Usually, it can be treated with chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy too, if you’re not clear after the first two months of chemo. Not many people are actually aware of what lymphoma is, or that it’s a cancer. Many have no clue what your lymph nodes do. Lymph nodes are part of the immune system; so you can imagine it’s pretty necessary for them to be working. To go into how they work and what they do will actually take me ages so I won’t bore you, if you are reading :P Anyways, I know so much about it is because I had it two years ago. And it was bloody hell. I had stage 4, and it was legit EVERYWHERE, like it’s not even exaggerated. I have 6 months of chemo and 11 sessions of radiotherapy. It was hell. I had a bunch of mental breakdowns and issues and I’m still seeing a shrink, bu t that’s not the point. The point is I survived. I met a girl at a Teens Unite Fighting Cancer sessions thing a few weeks agao and she never understood why I never told anyone about my cancer, and why I didn’t get support from people. The truth is I was an idiot and I really should have told people but what is done is done. Too late to change it now. She said that making people aware of the different types of cancers can push people to fundraise more and help find a cure. And she was right. So I’m awareing people of it now. Because it is a rare disease to get and not many people are aware. If I had know more about the symptoms and what it actually was, it wouldn’t have gotten to the stage that it did. And that you can help find a cure and help those who need it the most ) I’m doing to help others, and to make you aware of what it is. Yeah.

The contents resulted in a pretty good synopsis of my health during the past few years, so I’m adding it here. I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about 8 years ago. I immediately lost about 20 lbs and my blood glucose did go down. I resented being diagnosed just days before Halloween (as I looked forward to all that food coming in the holidays. But that first set of holidays, I persevered. I have struggled with motivation to “be good” and my resolve has often lapsed. Now, I have been diagnosed with Stage IV malignant melanoma (which is way more than just skin cancer. Have had lesions removed from my back, a huge mass removed from my right arm, and am getting treatment for the mass in my lung. I’m getting a biopsy on a lump in my breast sometime next week, and an ultrasound on my thyroid probably at the same time. With all that worry, my glucose levels have rollercoasted as have my emotions. However, I figure (in my more sanity-guided moments) I will let the docs deal with the cancer, and try to pay attention to the diabetes. Most days I find myself… After work (substitute teaching, I am fatigued so I might nap, then feed the dogs, give one of them her insulin, have some kind of dinner myself, and cloister myself to catch up on Netflix or some show. Or I try to research the cancer I have and learn about treatment therapies. Given what I know now, I would recommend others… Everyone’s situation is different. I do recommend some self evaluation. Writing in a journal (the food I eat, the mood I’m in, events of the day that might trigger overeating, etc) help me greatly to understand what’s happening in my mind to motivate indulgence that might not be the best choice for my body. What I could use is suggestions for ways to “treat” myself, or “reward” or “console” myself that don’t involve food or money. My life has changed in this way… Mostly I feel nearly defeated. Sometimes I’m resentful. I was always physically active, running, skiing, tennis, biking, and swimming. Injuries forced me to stop in my 30’s and 40’s. I became sort of a sloth.

For months it was diagnosed as sciatica, I guess I had the similar simptoms. It got worse when a few weeks later my world totally disintegrated when I learnt it was advanced agressive prostate cancer. The pain was from Bone Mets that has fractured my vertibrae in several places as well as limph nodes the cancer had also spread to my pelvis. I was in a bad state with no light at the end of the tunnel. I’m 55 with two daughters ages 12 & 14 , my world as well as my back was collapsing. That was a year ago. Now I’m back to work full time as an ambulance driving instructor my pain levels are managed and I’ve completely changed my life style from diet to mindset I’m a different person but in the same body. The tumours have shrunk considerably although my doctor keeps reminding me it’s incurable. They say Woody keep doing it whatever it is you are doing I steadfastly refuse to believe that it’s incurable and I refuse to let my illness become the centre of my life. My life has changed so much not all of it for the worse. I appreciate life far more than I have ever done. I’m grateful for each day and what it brings. My body has been majorly affected by hormone treatment but at least it’s keeping me living. I’m thankful for the simple things I know longer strive to have what I can’t have I’m happy contented and yet supposedly dying. Cancer is no longer the center attraction life goes on.

I had a follow up with the cancer center today, after receiving the report two days ago via email without knowing how to interpret it. I have Glioblastoma multiforme stage 4, which was the original diagnosis, instead of Oligodendroglioma stage 3. BUT it’s actually better, weirdly enough. Glio and Oligo are more or less the same, but the Oligo has 1p and 19q chromosome deletion. This does not. Glio is the “scarier” form of cancer because of the overall mortality rate of 96% over two years, but because of the genes present I have a more favorable prognosis with glioblastoma than Oligodendroglioma. I have a super high concentration of an mgmt wild type gene. Wild type means there is no mutation present, and it responds better to chemo and radiation than Oligodendroglioma. My KI-67 was lower than expected as well. That’s what determines overall tumor growth rate. He said of the 4% of patients that survive past 2 years, I have the highest possible chance of not only living beyond that, but actually beating it to some degree. I won’t live to retirement age certainly, but there is some rare cases where people live years. That wild type gene is essential to get through this. The cost of treatment is astronomical but debt means nothing if I can get through this and be there for my children. It’s the best possible conditions for a not so good situation. I’ve learned alot of humility and grace through all of this and it’s only been 5 weeks. I no longer hold grudges against anyone or anything. Reach out. Let each other know it’s okay to not be okay.

terminal,"To Share Or Not To Share To Share Or Not To Share There is no rule book for cancer. No guidelines to tell you how you are supposed to feel or act. No list (God how I love a list) of tasks to check off. But to me, there has never been a question of not sharing this ‘journey’ with the people in my life. How are people supposed to support you, show empathy and general kindness if they don’t know what you are going through? And let’s face it, I’ve always worn my heart on my sleeve so why should this be any different… So I’ll use this blog as a place to inform you all of my progress, vent my frustrations and maybe help others who find themselves in this impossible situation because the fact is that we do not talk about cancer enough. Before my initial diagnosis in , I had never even heard of my particular kind of cancer (GIST) and every single person I talked to about it outside of the medical profession had never heard of it either. I had no idea what I was dealing with. The current situation is thus: I have five tumours in my abdomen of varying sizes. The biggest is just over 2cm. The original singular gist was around 12cm. This recurrence is metastatic (more than one tumour) – never a word you want to hear when dealing with cancer – but the good news is that they are all in the same place and haven’t migrated to other parts of my body. Surgery is not possible so I’m being placed onto an oral chemotherapy drug called Imatinib. The aim of the drug is to prevent the tumours from growing/spreading further and, if I’m really lucky, shrink them into oblivion. My oncologist gave about an 80% chance of that happening. There is a chance though that one or more of the tumours will be resistant to the Imatinib and grow, in which case they would consider surgery on those stubborn clumps. There is also a chance that the Imatinib won’t work at all, in which case there are currently 4 other drugs that they could try to get it under control. She estimated that if the Imatinib is successful then, on average, it works for 3 years. When the tumours inevitably become resistant, it’s time to try the next drug. Best case scenario is that the Imatinib works immediately and the next scan in 3 months shows that they have shrunk or disappeared. However, if this happens, I still have to take the drugs. For life. This is because what we do know about this rare cancer is that it is aggressive and while it may not always be big enough to show up on a CT scan it is always going to be there, lurking, even if it is just a microscopic cell. I really appreciate honesty and thankfully my oncologist does not sugar-coat anything – the word she used was “incurable” and whilst that word is terrifying I think in the long term it’s best to know this. Though she does remain otpimistic that I should be around for a “long time yet” So, this is where we’re at. This is what I’m trying to process.

terminal,"Make-up Toxicity Make-up Toxicity I, like many people of my generation, love makeup. Growing up during the late ′s and ′s cosmetic influencers played a very important role. To this day there are many young Gen Z’ers and Gen Alphas that are coming into contact with make-up content, and generally love cosmetics. Cosmetics are not just make up, “ A “cosmetic” is any substance used to clean, improve or change the complexion, skin, hair, nails or teeth . Cosmetics include beauty preparations (make-up, perfume, skin cream, nail polish) and grooming aids (soap, shampoo, shaving cream, deodorant” We don’t discuss enough how absolutely dangerous some of these products are on the market. I’m not just talking about your cheap dollar store make-up. I am % talking about your super popular favorite eye-shadow palettes, your $60+ foundation, and your most loved mascara. I am talking about your body wash, lotion, and even your aluminum free deodorant. Your toothpaste, your hair creams, and your gel nail polish that you cure with a uv lamp. These chemicals are being placed on parts of your body that are supremely delicate, and your body is processing (or not) all of the materials within those products. I feel completely psychotic writing this all down, and I doubt anyone will stop to read. You probably already think I’m crazy. But when it comes to cancer, we shouldn’t play around, and although cancer related deaths have gone down due to medical advances in treatment and pharmaceuticals, we still need to have a discussion on why it is rates of cancer are going up so rapidly in the under 50 category. I am not for banning every single chemical that has a minute chance of causing cancer or endocrine disruption, but I am for smarter and longer studies of the chemicals being placed in our daily cosmetics. A lot of these cosmetic companies are given the go ahead to release their products to the public, as long as they do not cause any dramatic allergic reactions, but we need to be practical and make sure that the FDA is doing their due diligence. Most of us grew up eating frozen dinners out of plastic microwaved trays, we had Johnson & Johnson baby powder placed on our bodies daily, we wore/wear chemical filled deodorant, and still continue to bathe ourselves in very unnatural but nice smelling soaps. And as for POC, like myself, we grew up from a young age getting relaxers done on our hair and keratin treatments. It is not logical or rational to say that one item in your regimen is going to cause terminal cancer, but a life long interaction with a multitude of products that can raise your chances… you need to ask yourself these questions: “What is this? Where did it come from? Why am I doing this? And is it worth it” I can talk about a million different things that we need to change in this world, like what is our furniture made up of, and are you sure your home was built with materials that are safe for you to live in, what about your mattress? Are you cooking with plastic utensils, eating off of plastic plates, and cooking on a scratched up non-stick pan? Cause I know I am. I have. And I’m learning that much of the things that are natural to me, in this world, are not safe. Much of the food and products we consume on the daily are putting our families at risk. So please do your due diligence and take care of yourself in a way that your government won’t.",tumblr

So I started this new medication called Lynparza as well as my Lupron shots to stop all estrogen production so my cancer won’t spread. My doctor personally called me to tell me the results of my scans. NO NEW GROWTH and my breast tumor has shrank by about half. It was about 4 cm and now it’s about 2 cm. My body seems to also be trying to repair itself. So far, my new meds are working! I sobbed my heart out on the phone. I think I had a panic attack from all the pent up stress. Hopefully it keeps working. There is a pretty big side effect with this medication. I recognize and understand it. I accept it. I feel it is absolutely worth the risk as do my doctors.

I was given a new terminal diagnosis of stage 4 sarcoma. If I decided to stop treatment and go into hospice care, I wasn’t expected to see Christmas of the same year. I chose to continue to persue treatment to, at the very least, hopefully prolong my life. Staring down the barrel of this month is horrifying. Every day of it is one I wasn’t supposed to see. Then again every day of it feels like it could be the last. It’s this sickening mix of pride and panic. This is a time I didn’t expect to see. Even with treatment. Every day I wake up is a relief but also fills me with fear. Yes I woke up today but what about tomorrow? With the way things are looking for me, this fear can be considered almost irrational. Yes I’m sick, yes I’m weak, but I’m also going through treatment. Treatment that has me on a trajectory for recovery. So why am I still experiencing this fear? The simple answer is trauma. I was given a time limit for how long I’ll live. Once you’ve been told that, you can’t unhear it. It’s impossible to forget the time you shouldn’t be here to see. This time where you weren’t expected to be alive. It’s a sureal and hard to explain experience. I feel like I’m in the back of a store or wandered into a construction zone. It’s a feeling of wrongness, of “I’m not supposed to be here. I’m out of place in my own life. So here I am. In the month I was never meant to see. Crawling my way through it in disbelief.

I needed a place to talk about current events in my life and maybe escape a wee tiny bit into fandom because life has been kicking my ass this year. It turns out, quite literally. I’m not going to go into all of it, but the culmination of a year of rough stuff has been a diagnoses of stage IV colon cancer for myself. That means the cancer started in my colon but got curious and started noodling around in my lymph nodes and liver. It’s been a ride. The survival stats aren’t great for the diagnoses, but they’re also at least few years old by their very nature, regarding a cancer for which treatment developments are happening fast. They also represent the general population of stage IV patients which include a lot of elderly people with co-morbidities. At 51, I’m just a young whipper snapper and a relatively healthy one at that. It also matters where in your colon the cancer pops up and mine happens to be in a place where the type of cancer is more “mundane” (that’s a term that’s used apparently) and often more vulnerable to chemo. So there’s *lots* of hope! Thera also lots of bad stuff. The worst thing I’ve ever done to my kids is telling them I have this cancer. I have a pretty positive attitude, but the effect this and possible outcomes might have on them is the one thing that really threatens to drag me into a darker place. But!

terminal,"The Institution of work (warning, rambling stream of consciousness) I’ve written a bit about closure and normalization. But over the last few weeks I’ve come to realize that it’s a moving target. And perhaps one without a bullseye. I’m still struggling with finding a post-career, cancery-life, “new normal” Unlike retirement, I didn’t plan for (on) this and the decision to stop working came somewhat suddenly. It’s been quite an awakening as to just how much work had dominated my life. Career & work… Isn’t it interesting how we use these words to try and compartmentalize what in many cases is really the driving force in our lives? Maybe the illusion of compartmentalization is universal? How else could so many of us allow a “job” to rule our lives? Ask anyone who knows me well and I think they would say that I was someone who had a full life outside of work. But despite that, the job always won out in the end. If there was a project that needed completing (and there were always projects) or some other “important” thing that needed to get done, I did it. For many years running, I never used all of my vacation and often had more than half of it left to carry over into the following year. I kept telling myself I was saving up for the “big trip” but never got around to taking it. Even after I was diagnosed and should have been totally focused on my own needs, I allowed work to keep running my life. I had two major surges in aggressive disease activity that may have been driven in a large part by excessive work stress. Yup, I can be a slow learner… I would tell myself that working was the best way to keep my mind off the fact that I had stage IV disease and ultimately, a terminal diagnosis. Now in retrospect, what the hell was I thinking. That somehow my job was going to make it all go away? Or that I could keep going on like this was just a “chronic” disease? Even more troubling, that I was somehow so important to the “institution” that it trumped my health? And was it that important to my self esteem? All of these questions have been swirling around in my head as I try to make sense out of the whole thing. Several months ago my buddy Tim who is a Professor of Philosophy, used his considerable skills of reasoning to convince me that my worries about going out on disability were unfounded. I had managed to go off on a moral tangent, thinking that I wasn’t sick enough to become a “burden” on society… And I was also rambling on about how important my “work” was. His arguments being that one; I have stage IV cancer and it didn’t matter if I was still (mostly) physically able to work and two; the institution wouldn’t really care that I was gone. He wasn’t talking about the people I worked with but rather the actual institution, the “thing” that I worked for. Talk about stopping dead in my tracks. I was already starting to come around to the first argument thanks to the frequent reminders from my Oncology team but number two, that was something I hadn’t considered. It wasn’t that I saw myself as irreplaceable but I rather that I felt I was contributing to something important, something bigger than myself so to speak. But his words cut right through all that. “It” the institution, would just keep right on going without missing a beat. People would miss me, and things would change because of my absence but my contributions would begin to fade to the point of becoming nothing more than passing memories. How could it be any different? That’s how the world works whether we want to face up to it or not. It goes back to that Buddhist thing I’ve talked about so often, impermanence. My career was just as impermanent as everything thing else. It ended with no fanfare or accolades (the kind of stuff we aspired to in academia, no gold watch or retirement, I just quietly slipped away. And now? Now I’ll fade from the institutional memory. It’s already happening. It took that revelation to help me break free of the self imposed “institution of work” as I’ve come to think of it. Over the weekend Tim and I talked about all of this again and it made me realize just how far I’ve come. And it’s ok.",tumblr

I have Cerebral Palsy. I walk and stand in eays that are not natural for our bones and after 28 years, that shit hurts. All the time. Its hurt my entire life, so I have a God damn HIGH pain tolerance. Add onto that that my parents actively told me not to perform my pain. I was told that expressing or showing that I was hurting was selfish, annoying and needy. What’s the end result of that? I get to an 8 on the pain scale and the only ways I perform that high of a pain are: Deep breathing Closing my eyes against it Pinching my nose Maybe rubbing the bones that hurt if I can reach it I spent the last 5 or 6 years with my daily average being a 6 and I would hit an 8 at least 3 times a week. Constantly being in that amount of pain means that you earn to mask it very well. And yeah, when I’m in terrible pain, seeing double, about to puke, my voice is flat as fuck. I turn really pale but I keep my mouth shut. I’ve had doctors not believe my pain levels were that high regularly and all it did was make me reluctant to reach out for help managing my pain. They also refuse to believe my pain is that bad and yet I’m not taking opioid-based pain medication. I dont because I’m an addict. Same reason I dont keep a giant bottle of vodka in my house, I wont, but I also CANT. I promise if I did I’d become a raging alcoholic, just like one of my grandmothers. My point, though, is that people are sometimes taught that they aren’t even allowed to perform pain or discomfort and fuck those doctors and nurses who mock their patients or dont believe them. I literally had my back broken in four places as a kid and had to wait for my dad to essentially force the supervisors where I was working to take me to the hospital, because all I could do was sit and cry silently and they insisted I’d be screaming my head off if it was “that bad” My older brother has Downs Syndrome. He’s really good at masking his pain. Like, when he was 7 he had tonsillitis and my parents didn’t know until he passed out, because he didn’t tell them he wasn’t feeling well. We have to watch him to figure out if he’s hurting, and it scares the shit out of me that a doctor or nurse might not believe that he’s in pain because he doesn’t show it. Would like to again point out my experience from being a firefighter/emt who has had to do triage at multi-car pile ups: Dead people don’t scream. The more hurt someone is, the quieter they are. People who are screaming are breathing. People running around and shouting for help have brain and motor function. It’s the person quietly sitting still on the corner who is going into shock from internal bleeding. Also some people are just built different. I’ve had a person with a broken leg offer to limp themself to the ambulance. I had a woman complain of foot pain, apologized for calling over something trivial, and when we put her on the 4 lead heart monitor she was clearly having a minor heart attack. The heart attack was presenting weird symptoms, which is not unusual for woman as they have higher pain tolerances than men. If we had assumed she was just being dramatic and skipped the ECG part of the assessment protocol she could have fucking died. This is why when you go to the hospital every medical person who sees you keeps asking the same questions. We don’t know if the last asshat who did an assessment missed something important. also, like, if I performed my pain according to expectations, I’d probably be shouting all day and crying all night instead of doing literally anything useful, entertaining, or even distracting I feel like this would start annoying my housemates fast and me faster so like, how about I save expressions of intense pain for when it’s acute pain, something that needs immediate attention, not merely the chronic nonsense",tumblr

Or, backing up FURTHER and lots of people think this very likely, “Oh little Sionnat has obviously been taken by the fairies and they’ve left us a Changeling Child who knows too much, and asks strange questions, and uses words she shouldn’t know, and watches everything with her big dark eyes, clearly a Fairy Child and not a Human Like Us” The Myth of the Changeling child, a human baby apparently replaced at a young age by a toddler who “suddenly” acts “strange and fey” is an almost textbook depiction of autistic children. To this day, “autism warrior mommies” talk about autism “stealing” their “sweet normal child” and have this idea of “getting their real baby back” which (in the face of modern science) indicates how the human psyche actually does deal with finding out their kid acts unlike what they expected. Given this evidence, and how common we now know autism actually is, the Changeling myth is almost definitely the result of people’s confusion at the development of autistic children. Weirdly enough, that legend is now comforting to me. I think it’s worth noting that many like me, who are diagnosed with ASD now, would probably have been seen as just a bit odd in centuries past. I’m only a little bit autistic; I can pass for neurotypical for short periods if I work really hard at it. I have a lack of talent in social situations, and I’m prone to sensory overload or you might notice me stimming. But here’s the thing: life is louder, brighter and more intense and confusing than it has ever been. I live on the edge of London and I rarely go into the centre of town because it’s too overwhelming. If I went back in time and lived on a farm somewhere, would anyone even notice there was anything odd about me? No police sirens, no crowded streets that go on for miles and miles, no flickery electric lights. Working on a farm has a clear routine. I’d be a badass at spinning cloth or churning butter because I find endless repetition soothing rather than boring. I’m not trying to romanticise the past because I know it was hard, dirty work with a constant risk of premature death. I don’t actually want to be a 16th century farmer! What I’m saying is that disability exists in the context of the environment. Our environment isn’t making people autistic in the sense of some chemical causing brain damage. But we have created a modern environment which is hostile to autistic people in many ways, which effectively makes us more disabled. When you make people more disabled, you start to see more people struggling, failing at school because they’re overwhelmed, freaking out at the sound of electric hand dryers and so on. And suddenly it looks like there’s millions more autistic people than existed before. …disability exists in the context of the environment” Reblog for disability commentary.

I don’t think they got the joke there so and I explained that I wasn’t religious at all and a couple of people asked me how I live with cancer and I explained that I just do, it; it is what it is and I just carry on carrying on apparently I’ve got I’ve got an amazing attitude. The tangents Somebody else asked me about American gun control I mean why they would ask somebody British about American gun control? It’s something that just amazes me I guess; it’s because we don’t have guns or we do have guns but I explained it it’s different, it’s a different kind of society here we’re not all gun crazy we don’t need to have guns, yes I explained that we had two hope high profile massacres; the Hungerford massacre in the s which meant the end of owning assault weapons and then the Dunblane massacre in the 90s where automatic weapons and revolvers were outlawed. I tried to explain that realistically we have a sort of voluntary gun control, contrary to popular belief we can own guns but as a populace the vast majority of us choose not to. The law is if you want to own a shotgun or a long rifle you must show a need for one, self-defence is not considered a need. I live in a city, I live in London; why would I need a gun in London? there is no reason for me to have a gun if you dismiss self-defence and I’m not going to hunt anything, the biggest wild animal in this country is a fox so there’s nothing really to hunt and because nobody else has got guns I don’t need a gun, it’s a different culture, completely different gun culture here to what is in America so I don’t feel qualified to speak on American gun control apart from the fact that it’s probably our, the British’ fault that the right to bear arms exist because if my history serves me correctly it was part of the American constitution which was formed after they kicked the British out and the whole reason for having a well-armed militia, I think that’s the phrase in the constitutional, well armed militia was in case we came back and they have ready army on hand to defend their homeland. So yeah you could say realistically the American gun culture is our fault but other than that I’m not really qualified to speak on their gun culture; it’s their country their gun culture; I can only see it from the outside what I see does horrify me but that’s the way it is. Then we got talking about my world records and I showed a couple of videos and that’s how the conversations have gone and I’ve managed to fill three hours. We we’re talking about this and that an it just seemed like the three hours just flew past, we touched on the beer I was drinking with a discussion about real ale we had some discussions about regional accents in the UK and apparently there’s no accents in Eritrea. The time just evaporated And it just it was just amazing at how quickly the three hours went, it’s a novel experience to say the least and I quite enjoy it. It did leave me very worn out but that’s what happens I guess I’m going to try again tonight at after 9 o'clock this time coz I want to try it different times of day in different hours of the day to see which works. Apparently at that time I’m going to be competing with the guitar and drum players, now the guitar and drum players get a lot of viewers but I don’t mind only getting a few I’m just going to be me and do what I need to do and worry about what I need to worry about and not what others do.

I’m reblogging this for the amount of thought that was put into figuring out the necessary configuration for a mertaur wheelchair. MMMMM, the LAYERS to this. She’s technically a monster too. She might not look it at first glance and seems mostly human, but it isn’t deniable even despite her looks compared to the other monsters. But she realizes that she is still not like the rest of the monsters either and may not have entirely the same experiences as them, which is why she feels that she might not belong to or deserve to go to the support group. By sometimes passing as human, she feels she isn’t worthy of the space. The sad reality though is even though she’s mostly human in appearance, that tail she has undeniably would still cause her some struggle. Humans are still gonna look at that tail and think she’s a freak. There are probably still accommodations she needs because of the tail that she may still struggle to have access to. Even if it is just the tail, that tail is still enough to other her from humans and cause her problems and discrimination. She should get to belong in that support group even if she gets told she’s not monster “enough. She still shares some of the same struggles as them that are caused by being a monster, and needs support. This is an excellent demonstration of the flaws in the concept of passing privilege. Bravo to the artist. NOW I will reblog this. Image description: A comic in seven panels Panel 1: A wolf man wearing a pale blue polo shirt and dark blue pants faces the viewer. He is saying, “Uh… I’m sorry ma’am, but this is a support group for monsters only” With his right hand, he gestures to a group of monsters sitting around a table in the background. The monsters are a giant bat, a gorilla, and a dragon. They are facing away from the viewer. Panel 2: A white woman with blonde hair wearing a pink striped shirt and dark capri pants says with a smile, “Well, actually , I AM a monster” The wolf man replies, looking skeptically, … How” Panel 3: The woman responds, while looking at the viewer, “Well, you see, my mother was a mermaid and my father was a minotaur” Above her head, there is a thought cloud depicting a mermaid in a tank holding hands and looking lovingly at a Minotaur who is standing outside of the tank. Panel 4: The wolf man, still looking dismissive, says, “Riiight. And let me guess: You got the human half from both of them” The woman responds, “Exactly” The wolf man says, “Gotcha. Hardy har har ” Panel 5: The wolf man points and makes a snarling face at the woman, saying, “Ya know, it’s insensitive mockery like this that makes us need these groups in the first place” The woman holds up her hands defensively, leaning away and looking surprised. She says, “Huh” Panel 6: The woman says, “Listen sir, I’m just here to drop off my brother and I’ll be on my way” She still has a worried expression and gestures to her brother behind her. Her brother has a Minotaur upper half and a fish lower half. He is riding a mobility device. He says, “This guy buggin’ you sis” while raising an eyebrow” The wolf man looks astonished. Panel 7: The woman is shown walking off-panel to the left. She says over her shoulder, “I’ll be back to pick you up at seven” Since her back is to the viewer, we can now see that she has a tail. Her brother says, “Sounds good, thanks” The wolf man continues to look astonished” End ID Thanks for the image description!

Yeah, me too. McKenzie Scott is literally proof that these fuckers can donate HUGE sums of money to EVERYTHING and still live a comfortable life. But nooO someone HAS to justify the pitifully small donations the richest men on earth make every year for their tax write-off Some also important context (this is June , after her second round of grants was announced, as well: She’s trying to singlehandedly redistribute the wealth she took back from Jeff Bezos and is failing at it because the economy is built so that wealth travels from the bottom, accumulates at the top, and then stays there. She literally cannot give her money away fast enough. Think about this. This is our current capitalist economy at work. It is working as intended and designed by those who benefit from it. Her story is incredibly revealing of how and where the system is failing. It also means that we can, indeed, tax the hell out of billionaires and they will not suffer at all. ALT this thread is proof it works Here’s Who MacKenzie Scott Donated To So Far In February In case anyone was curious what she’s been up to lately. (She has stopped publicly announcing the donations, saying that too much attention was going to her instead of the organizations she chose. Recipients are welcome to name her as the donor when they announce whatever they’re doing with the money, however) ALT That Forbes article did miss the point kinda but this little quote: “In a December Medium post, Scott said she would not reveal the latest recipients of her donations, arguing that the media focuses too much on her and not on the groups she gives money to. Forbes takes the position that people with billions of dollars at their disposal warrant more scrutiny than average Americans because of the power that money wields. After calls for more transparency, in December Scott wrote that she hopes to launch a website with a searchable grants database this year” Is really fascinating to me because I think they wouldn’t care what she was doing with the money if she wasn’t giving it away ALT",tumblr

If it’s passed there will be NO PRIVACY AT ALL. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO SCAN ALL OF YOUR MESSAGES AND SEIZE OR DELETE IT WITHOUT WARNING. ON ANY PLATFORM. This. NOW THIS. IS A VOILATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. A BIG ONE TOO. The person who originally created the bill is trying to push it as quickly as possible to prevent media attention. DONT GIVE IT TO THEM. BOOST AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. TWITTER, INSTAGRAM, YOUTUBE, IT DOESNT MATTER. DO WHAT YOU CAN BECAUSE I FOR ONE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP MESSAGES PRIVATE. According to the nextgov article (Pasted from Nextgov.com) (Please note last paragraph is most important therefore it is in bigger letters: The Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies, or EARN IT Act, was reintroduced into the U.S. Senate on Monday, reopening the potential for Congress to impose stricter penalties related to online content featuring child sex abuse material. A key pillar of the proposed legislation is augmenting the provisions outlined in Section of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from being liable for third party content hosted on their domains. Should the EARN IT Act pass, it would limit the blanket protections established in Section given to web hosts such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, leaving them vulnerable to potential prosecution. “There are tens of millions of photos and videos circulating throughout the internet, showing the most heinous acts of sexual abuse and torture of children” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, one of the bill’s sponsors. “The EARN IT Act removes Section blanket liability protection from service providers in the area of child sexual abuse material on their sites. The days of children being exploited on the internet and their families being unable to do anything about it are coming to an end” In addition to reducing liability protections against host sites, the EARN IT Act would also establish the National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention, which would advise online service providers on how to prevent online child abuse and exploitation. Initially introduced in the Congress by both Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, the bill brings a slew of bipartisan cosponsors, including Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; Maggie Hassan, D-NH; Rob Portman, R-Ohio; and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Many of these lawmakers view the EARN IT Act as an important restriction on the power and immunity of Big Tech companies. “There’s no reason Big Tech should be given special immunity from laws against child pornography” said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. “This commonsense bill was approved unanimously in committee last Congress. Big Tech needs to be held responsible for their role in distributing child pornography” The bill is not without controversy, however. Critics have said that as part of its crackdown on child abuse content, it may incentivize web hosts to relax their end-to-end encryption standards to better access users’ private messages. “The EARN IT Act also takes aim at end-to-end encryption, which is one of the most important technologies keeping people safe from violence and abuse” digital rights group Fight for the Future said in a statement on Tuesday. “Strong encrypted messaging also protects our hospitals, schools, airports and water treatment facilities. Disincentivizing popular services from offering strong encryption to users will put lives in danger for absolutely no benefit” Back in , when the bill was first introduced, over 20 other nonprofits and advocacy groups cosigned a letter addressed to Graham and Feinstein warning of threats posed to vulnerable demographics should encrypted messages be weakened. “In addition to censorship concerns, the EARN IT Act also threatens to disincentivize platforms from providing strong encryption, which is an essential service to the LGBTQ community, who rely on encryption to access a support network; seek resources to combat discrimination and abuse; and find doctors and treatment to assist with transition and other health concerns” the letter reads. - Ok look, I fully understand wanting to ban child porn, it’s bad and it should be stopped, but this bill is threaten queer communites, and knowing the fanbase of tumblr (Very gay) this is really bad for us. If it passes, we could be in serious trouble. PLEASE BOOST THIS! REBLOG! REPOST! WHATEVER YOU CAN! LOOK FOR PETITIONS ONLINE, TELL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY, ANYTHING HELPS. And if you still need more proof, just look up “Earn it Act” online and you should see several news articles regarding it. OH MY FUCKING GOD",tumblr

I worked with a beekeeper (not at beekeeping, guy had a day job as a machinist and kept bees as a side thing. One day there was a swarm in the parking lot and people were freaking out because, y'know, BEES EVERYWHERE. Beekeeper guy went to his truck. Pulled a swarm-catching box out. Put it on the ground and walked away. Bees went in the box after a while. Guy put the box back in his truck and drove home with them. You cannot prevent bees from leaving a hive they don’t like the conditions of, without also preventing them from being able to make honey. The latter is dependent on them being able to come and go as they please. If they don’t like their hive THEY WILL LEAVE. Beekeeping is probably the single most non-exploitative animal agriculture in the entirety of human history. I don’t know how it’s even possible to exploit bees. They answer only to their queen. On that note, if their queen isn’t doing her job, they make up done queen jelly and feed it to a new bee to make a new queen and can kill the old one.

WHERE is my comedy sequel about that. where the FUCK is it. where is my scene of the servants and royals like “we’re so happy our beloved, perfect princess is finally back ” and then she walks in covered in mud, smelling like riverwater, carrying a live fish and saying “i caught dinner” phillip sees nothing wrong with this prince phillip is quietly and intensely goddamn grateful that he managed to be the first man aurora ever saw because like she is the most incredible woman he’s ever seen in the entire world and he’s a dude that hangs out in the woods talking to his horse which is also her favourite activity like, their parents are all very smug at what a great love match they’ve made in hooking their kids up together somehow–there was a dragon involved? ok–except it turns out that the reason they get along so fucking well is they’re snarky little shits with no tact and less patience who spend as much time as humanly possible ditching out on court duties to fuck around in the woods the kings and queens can only hope that the prince and princess are literally fucking around in those woods, because at this rate their only hope for a halfway functional heir to the throne is going to be kidnapping their own grandchildren or maybe just crowning the damn horse",tumblr

terminal,"The situation in Ukraine Ukraine March I don’t claim to be any sort of military strategist. I do have claim to be a student of history; history was my favourite subject at school also something I studied in further education and have had an interest in ever since. History has taught me that there are only two ways to capture a city. Encirclement and siege or scorched earth. There doesn’t appear to have been any in-between these 2 options. World War 2 and to a lesser extent the wars since then have shown that armour is very ineffective in a city environment and also very vulnerable. A Molotov cocktail thrown by a single person onto a tank moving slowly through an urban street has the potential to destroy that tank. Armour needs to be able to manoeuvre to both protect itself and project it’s power, it’s far better suited to wide open fields and plans where it can rain down it’s destruction from a distance, putting it inside an urban environment negates both it’s manoeuvrability and it’s ability to attack from a distance. The only way to make a city a suitable environment for armour is to clear it building by building and then to level those buildings. A very long and very brutal process that would cost countless lives on both sides. The other choice is siege. This is another long term strategy and ties up massive amounts of resources as you have to encircle the city and cut off every avenue of supply completely, very hard to do in the modern world. There appears to be no in-between these 2 choices apart from the hope that the defenders of the city just surrender and to make that happen the attacker needs to become so brutal that the defenders think surrendering is the only way to save themselves, to do this means starting a scorched earth policy. There is of course in the modern world another option, the option to just wipe that city out in an instant but even that’s a double edged sword because you put your own encircling forces in harm’s way. If I had to guess what Putin’s intentions were, then looking back at history I would say the massive amount of armour he is moving in is for encirclement and siege so this look like it’s a long term strategy developing and won’t be over any time soon.

terminal,"Cancer update Mar Haematology Appointment Feb I went to the cancer unit of my hospital for what I thought was going to be a routine appointment, I should have guessed it was going to be a little different because they did not have me booked in for a blood test which is very unusual. The letter when I get the letter telling me when my next haematology appointment is it always states that I should turn up 30 minutes earlier for a blood test, which is what happened with this letter and this visit but there was no blood test this time. Seeing the Doctor When I went in to see the haematologist, I should have guessed that it was going to be a different appointment because the clinical nurse specialist was also there which is unusual. She doesn’t normally take part in any visits to the haematologist, I was also seeing a haematologist that I had not seen before; I already like her because she’s honest and straight forward and gives it to me without any sugar coating which is exactly what she did. The news She told me that my case had been discussed with the team and they looked at the results of my scan or rather they looked at the results of my recent scan and could confirm that my cancer was spreading, that didn’t come as a surprise to me because I’ve been exhibiting symptoms for the last few weeks which is why they decided to put me back on chemotherapy at the beginning of the year. She also told me that if the current treatment I was on wasn’t working and I started to exhibit more or worsening symptoms they would change my chemotherapy regimen to RCHOP which is a much more aggressive chemotherapy, this is the one where you lose your hair and other nasty side effects. The rhetoric had also changed normally they say treatment, but she said at this point everything was now geared towards keeping me alive, when I queried her on her choice of wording, she said again my cancer had spread and that going forward they were aiming to keep me alive. More unwelcome news We also discussed something else that had appeared on my most recent scan, the consultant that reviewed it had spotted something on my pancreas and wanted a closer look so I’m scheduled for another scan to look at my pancreas. I have been exhibiting some symptoms which could be associated with pancreatic problems including two that are quite a quite noticeable the first one is my poo has been floating for about six weeks now every time I have a poo it floats when it’s solid most of the time it’s diarrhoea, but it floats which is a sign that the fat in food isn’t being absorbed properly; that’s a function of the pancreas. Another one is I’ve been having for the last two weeks excessive flatulence it’s quite noticeable these two signs alone are signs there is possibly something wrong with the pancreas if I’m honest I’m not expecting good news from the results of the next scan which should be in a weeks’ time but it is what it is I will deal with it and if it’s what I suspected it is I can only hope that it’s been caught early enough to be treated; if it’s not well we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. My partner says that I shouldn’t think like this because I’m just borrowing trouble, the only issue there is it’s my body I know when something’s not right, and somethings not right in my stomach area. Since September last year and coupled with the pains I’ve been experiencing and these new symptoms I’ve been experiencing it’s telling me there’s definitely something not right. The fact that they want to have another look at my pancreas is leading me to a conclusion that possibly my cancer has spread to my pancreas. Pancreatic cancer is not very nice cancer and in the last five years I’ve had two good friends that have gone from being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer to death in under two months; that’s pancreatic cancer but maybe I’m just looking on the bad side. Maybe it’s not that, maybe as my partner says I am borrowing trouble; but in my head its plan for the worse and everything else is a bonus and let’s be honest I’ve been fighting cancer for over nine years probably longer because it was only nine years ago I was diagnosed my cancer; it had probably been growing within me for three years previous to that so it’s fair to say that I’ve been fighting cancer for 10 years now. I’ve had four lots of treatment and I’ve beaten it back each time and I’m not getting any younger and it’s fantastic that I’ve had 10 years, so I don’t have any complaints. We really didn’t to discuss it that deeply because I think they want to see what the scan says but I think I know where this is going maybe I’m just being pessimistic about it I don’t know but I know when something’s not right and something’s not been right for a good few weeks with my body so I’m preparing for the worst; a depressing status I know. More Shielding Another thing that came out of this meeting as we discussed COVID and the relaxing of the restrictions and how I was getting on with them with improving my core fitness and I pointed out that since the new COVID variant have become dominant at the end of last year I’ve gone back to being a prisoner in my own home and I’ve given up my gym membership so I don’t go swimming. I don’t go out to the gym anymore to keep away from people but now that we are coming out of those restrictions I looked at them and I said can I go back out to going out in public and can I go back out to the gym and swimming and both the nurse and the haematologist looked at me with a look of horror and screamed NO! at me in really loud voices. So that’s where we are, we’re investigating my pancreas and it should happen in the next couple of weeks but we’re also looking at increasing the dosage of the medication that I’m on gradually until it’s quadrupled from 5 milligrams where I am at the moment daily to 20 milligrams daily, we’re looking at that being 10 months from now which effectively means we’ve written off this year as another year the I can’t go out so this will now be my third year as social distancing prisoner. Coming off the steroids Since the beginning of Jan 22, I’ve also been on high dose steroids, 30 milligrams per day and I was on those for four weeks and I felt absolutely fantastic they really made me feel good and they also stopped the pain in my stomach area meaning I didn’t have to touch the morphine which is great. The least amount of morphine I have to take the better, you can’t stay on steroids forever and you have to come off of them by ramping the dose down which I have been doing and I’m ramping it down by 5 milligrams a week so I’ve gone from daily 30 milligrams, this week I’ve started on the 15 milligrams per day so I’m on the third week of the ramping and then next week it will be 10 milligrams. I expressed concern that a lot of the way that I’ve been feeling good was brought on by the steroids and they also were masking symptoms and as I am reducing the dose the stomach pains are coming back. I expressed the concern that I was dreading coming off the steroids completely because I would go back to being the old me which was quite lethargic and being ill because everybody has noticed a difference in me these last few weeks have been on steroids. I’ve noticed how much I’ve changed how much good it’s done me but like I said you can’t be on them forever at least I assume that, but the haematologist did say that will have a look and see what’s happening once I’m off the steroids and if necessary, they can put me back on them again. which is absolutely fantastic because if I do regress when I’m off the steroids I know that I’ve got that option to go back on them which is which is good, but at the same time bad because like I say, they don’t like you on steroids long term but they are talking about me being on the then long term. Then what we must do is work at a dose which is enough to keep me stable but the very minimum dose. I am not expecting good news with the with the scan of my pancreas since I’m exhibiting some other symptoms which are normally associated with pancreatic cancer, and we’ll see what’s happening there. I’ve got appointment in a month’s time hopefully by then we’ll have had the scan done and the results back and we’ll see where we’re going from there. I keep saying it’s a bit of a depressing status and maybe I’ve got it wrong I don’t know, but we shall see, but whatever it is I’ll deal with it as I normally deal with it and I’m just smile on. Mentally I have prepared for the worst, and I am good with it, I really am, the problem is going to be for others around me. Let’s hope I am wrong. Read the full article",tumblr

terminal,"More venting More venting So I feel as if I might have cancer after all. Side effects from immunotherapy. Got my 3rd infusion last Wednesday, and felt fine. I expected the same side effects as the last time. I worked Thursday and the headache I’ve had for three weeks got really very incredibly bad. immobilizing even. After some discussion with my oldest, a friend, and an on-call nurse from my insurance, we decided I needed to call and go to ER, if for nothing else, to make sure it’s not a stroke. No stroke, a CTscan revealed no brain metastases, a bunch of blood tests, some new meds to take, and rather quicker than I expected, I was home. ER doc indicated it is probably a reaction to the immunotherapy. The headache had subsided a little; at least I could get my jammies on and get into my own bed. I was able to work Friday, then by Friday evening my headache returned with vengeance and now, added nausea. My body was definitely rebelling against me. Saturday, was awful. It was now the worst headache I’ve ever had in my life. So bad, I could not read the prescriptions on the medicine containers. I threw up. Called my oldest. They came over, gave me the right medicine, fresh water, crackers and toast. It was so comforting to have them help me so sweetly. Oh, but i was down. Slept for the rest of the weekend. Got up this morning (Monday) and felt much better, thinking i could work today. Halfway through the day, I felt that kind of shaky fatigue that makes you think you can’t function. My youngest calls it “dizzy tired” Odd, since I spent the entire weekend in bed, alone, mostly sleeping. One more infusion to go. Ugh.",tumblr

terminal,"Ramping down steroids High dose steroids Back at the beginning of January my haematologist put me on a daily dose of thirty milligrams steroids; the steroid they chose was Prednisolone. I was put on this steroid for four weeks at the dose of thirty milligrams per day. The feel-good factor There is no doubt about it these steroids made me feel good, I had a mental energy and enthusiasm that I thought I had lost for good. I started quite a few projects and even finished a few; this is unusual for me because I normally start something never see it through, but the steroids had a fantastic effect on me giving me the desire to see things through. it was not just me that noticed it, other people noticed how different I was on these steroids, my partner did comment several times they appeared to have given me a new energy and more importantly they also reduced the pain in my side which was the primary goal. You cannot stay on steroids forever Steroids are one of those drugs you can only spend a limited time on, in my case they decided that four weeks at the high dose would be enough and then from week five onwards I had to ramp down the dose by five milligrams a week. This meant on week 5 I was taking twenty-five milligrams a day then week 6 I was taking twenty milligrams a day this step down of five milligrams would happen until I was off the steroids As I reduced the dose, I did not really notice the difference until halfway into the ten milligrams per day week, the first notable sign that the steroids were reducing was the pain in my side this started to come back, not as bad as it was before the steroids but enough to let me know it was there. At about the same time I noticed this energy of mine was starting to waver and I just felt very lethargic, and I really did not want to do very much and still do not. It was good while it lasted It was good while it lasted and the high dose steroids gave me some respite from the pain and the fatigue, However as I’m stepping down the dose I’m returning to how I was prior to the start of January, I shall miss the energy the steroids give me but I’ve got to come off them so I guess I’ll just have to accept this is the way. Last night I really struggled to get to sleep because of the pain and in the end the only way I could do it was by taking Oramorph, This did the trick and knocked me out like a light, when I woke up this morning though I felt absolutely awful, nauseousness, tired and just generally feeling like shit, it’s taken most of the day so far before I started to feel normal again. Steroids are good and bad when they work, they really work well but coming down off them it is a bit of a nightmare. I have got 8 days left of steroids and tomorrow I must cut the dose again to five milligrams per day, stopping them altogether is something I am dreading, but it is what it is, and I’ll just have to deal with it. I will let you know how I get on in another post. Read the full article",tumblr

terminal,"I like a nicely trimmed bush No, not that kind of trimmed bush, although I do enjoy that as well, but the shrub kind. After being a virtual prisoner in my own home due to “shielding” during the covid pandemic it’s just so nice to get out and about again. My needing to use a wheelchair full time when I am out and about coincided with the start of the pandemic (I have an incurable cancer and an incurable lung disease, both combine to affect my mobility) so I never really got to see and experience some of the issues I would have with it. Now I am finally getting out I am finding lots of issues being in a wheelchair, this video is one example. I have used this bus stop for years, it’s my local bus stop for some destinations and AFAICT this bush (shrub/tree, whatever it’s green and I don’t do green shit) has been overgrown onto the pavement like this for years. It never really bothered me when I could walk and so I gave it no thought at all, that is until I needed to get a bus form there in my wheelchair, it’s a real PITA as I have to both back into the bush then drive forwards into it to get onto a bus and it normally leaves me covered in green stuff. My partner doesn’t want me to do anything like either approaching the householder and telling them that their bush is an issue or contacting the local council (It’s overgrown onto the pavement by almost a meter, very illegal) about it as birds are nesting in it and anything that is done to cut it back would interfere with the birds and their nests. This means I have to use another bus stop almost half a mile further away or just put up with having to drive into a bush if I use this stop. Currently I am suffering the bush as the extra drive to the next stop reduces my battery life at my destination. Read the full article",tumblr

terminal,"Follicular Lymphoma and night cramps, How I beat them. The night time cramp dance. I hate this dance, I hate it so much. There you are fast asleep then suddenly you are dragged awake by an unbelievable pain in one or more of your legs, you have no choice you just must jump out of bed and dance round the room shouting “Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck” (Well that’s what I shout, you might choose different words. No amount of trying to relax the muscle, stretch it or massage it works, hot or cold compresses don’t work, you either have to wait for the spasm to end or hold your foot/leg in some ridiculous angle to take the strain off of the muscle which usually ends up in you cramping up an entirely different muscle and yet more pain. This cramp can sometimes go on for minutes and then you spend the next day or so having an after pain which also hurts. I tried everything the Doctors suggested I have follicular lymphoma, an incurable cancer and along with this comes night cramps. I have mentioned these to my Dr’s so many times now and between us we have tried everything “I see you are on statins, it must be those, stop taking them” So I did for 2 months and still the cramps happened every night without fail. The doctors then went through all of my meds each time blaming one, they stopped it and still the cramps continued. They even blamed rituximab and when my course was over and I stopped it, guess what? the cramps still carried on. Hot compresses they said… didn’t work Cold compresses they said… didn’t work Take quinine they said… didn’t work I had so many blood tests and they couldn’t find anything wrong with my levels ( except for cancer related neutrophils, lymphocytes and anaemia) nothing in any blood test that would traditional traditionally lead to cramps like low magnesium or potassium. The most useless piece of advice They kept telling me that when I cramped up the best thing, I could do was to stretch the muscle, that alone told me they had no idea what these cramps were like, you can’t “stretch” the muscle, that just hurts even more then the cramp did, these aren’t like the cramps that sports people suffer where a man with a sponge and a bottle of water make them go away, they are deep and long last and they fucking hurt, I mean really fucking hurt and trying to stretch the muscle just makes them fucking hurt even more. I really was at my wits end. These cramps were driving me nuts, I really wasn’t getting any quality sleep, they were waking me up during the night then because I was so tired, I’d fall asleep during the day for several hours. Then I came across a medical research paper which discussed that in the ’s miners and steel workers were suffering a very high incidence of agonising cramps during their shifts but more importantly this happened towards the end of their shifts and not the beginning. Both the miners and steel workers worked in extremely hot conditions which caused them to sweat excessively and from that they deduced that when they were sweating, they were losing salt. The workers upped their salt consumption prior to starting a shift and the incidents of cramps decreased. Night sweats are a part of lymphomas If you have lymphoma, you’ll know all about the night sweats, they are absolutely drenching ones and in fact they can even leave those salt stains on your bedclothes. But is salt the answer? sort of, well it’s part of the answer. Research done during the ’s and ’s into athletes that suffered cramp showed that during a cramp their salt levels were low but also other electrolytes as well, the cramps were more common the more the athletes sweated beforehand. In other words they were sweating away important electrolytes the body needed, salt (sodium) being just one of them. These were what they identified in the sweat Sodium magnesium potassium calcium These just happen to also be the minerals that make up of the majority of athletes hydration drinks Last thing at night With the research in mind at night I would make up a bottle of orange quash and add 1gram of electrolyte powder to it, just to digress for a moment, I used to take a bottle of water to put beside my bead that would drink when I woke up dehydrated after a sweat, this wasn’t a good thing because all I was doing was further diluting the few electrolytes I hadn’t already sweated out. Anyway, my new orange squash hydration drink, I would have a glass just before bed and keep the rest beside my bed for when I woke up in the night. The results were instant I couldn’t believe the very first night I tried this was the very first night I actually had a good night’s sleep, I went through the night without a single cramp. It’s now been over a month since my last night cramp and it’s great being able to sleep all through the night. Made up drinks I now keep a bottle full of orange squash mixed with electrolyte powder beside my bed at night and if I do wake up to go to the loo or anything like that, I take a few swigs from that because I still lose salt and other electrolytes through sweat. I also make up a bottle of orange squash or other fruit juice with electrolytes to drink throughout the day just to make sure my levels are good. Hopefully my cure for night cramps will also cure yours as well, let me know in the comments how you got on. Read the full article",tumblr

terminal,"Hard drive fun and games I had a Hard Drive (HDD) failure For about the last week my PC has been playing up and my E: drive kept opening window to show me it’s contents all by itself. As well as that I have had a bizarre dialogue box come up every now and again telling me the PC can’t run this program and to contact the vendor. The bizarre thing is that it wouldn’t tell me which program it was. I set aside the coming weekend to deal with these issues which I thought were caused by a rogue program so the plan was to start to uninstall programs starting with the ones I had most recently installed and working backwards until the one which was causing the issues had been removed. If that didn’t work, I was just going to reset windows. However, on Saturday morning when I switched my PC on it took ages to boot up, with the longest part being the wait for the bios splash screen, that immediately told me that something had changed, something hardware and that the bios was configuring itself to the new system. Once it had booted, I checked the PC and spotted straight away that my E: drive was missing. For both the BIOS and Windows failing to see and HDD can mean only one thing, the HDD has failed for some reason. I removed the faulty HDD I had 3 HDD’s in my PC ( the C: boot drive is a NVME drive) 1 Toshiba 1TB, 1 Seagate 1TB and 1 Seagate 4TB HDD so I shut the machine down and restarted it this time I went into the BIOS first and looked at the peripherals screen, why? Well, I was going to remove the faulty HDD but I didn’t know exactly which one it was so by going into the BIOS and seeing what HDD’s the BIOS was seeing then by default the one it wasn’t seeing was the faulty one. On the peripherals screen the BIOS was seeing the Seagate 4TB and the Seagate 4TB HDD’s. This told me that the faulty HDD was the Seagate 1TB. I shut the PC down and pulled it out from under the table to open it up. As I worked out which drive was faulty I went straight to it, disconnected it and removed it. I then put the PC back together and booted into the BIOS screen (this is to make the PC re read it’s configuration so it won’t take so long to boot in future) once I had checked it was seeing the remaining HDD’s I then did a save and exit and carried on with the boot. One it had rebooted I then told it to restart, this is it did, and it was back to it’s usual very fast boot time as it was before these issues started. 12 years old When I upgrade a PC I remove the HDD’s from the old one and reuse them in the new ones and keep a little note of which HDD’s they were, turns out the faulty one came from a PC I had built in so this drive had been trundling away in various machine for 12 years, not bad I guess. Rescuing the data The faulty drive was my “downloads” and MP3 drive; this is where everything I downloaded was stored as well as my MP3 collection. The downloads I wasn’t bothered about because I can easily download the stuff again, however the MP3’s had been purchased from Amazon and I didn’t want to lose them. I have a Wavlink USB drive dock and cloner and I happen to have an older spare Seagate 1TB HDD so tried to clone the faulty drive, but the Wavlink wasn’t even seeing it. Now HDD’s fail for only a few reasons, either the circuit board fails, the arm gets stuck on a platter, or the motor fails with either a circuit board or a motor failure it’s an easy fix and replacing them sorts it out, and arm failing is slightly more complicated, but it can be fixed and as long as the platters aren’t too badly damaged you can still get the data off of it. First thing to try was the easiest, swap out the circuit board, this took about 10 mins and put the drive back into the USB dock and straight away it was read meaning the problem was indeed the old circuit board. I then copied the data onto another drive in my pc, then I swapped the circuit board back putting it back onto it’s original drive. Why? Well it might not have been the circuit board, it might have been an arm or a motor failure and the movement taking it out and fiddling with it might have freed them, regardless of that, I don’t trust a HDD once it starts playing up so that’s why I put the board back on the original drive, I knew that one was fine. Once the board was back on it, I checked it and it was working so it went back to being a spare drive. The faulty one I opened up and removed the platters from it then ran a magnet all over them to make sure any data on the was totally destroyed then I binned all the pieces. I ordered a new HDD from Amazon Why not use my spare drive? Well, the spare is only 1TB and it’s around 15 years old, I do a lot of video editing and the files can be GB or more in size so it doesn’t take many to fill a 1TB HDD up My new HDD arrived yesterday, all installed and working in my PC. 4TB 3.5"" HDD £52.95 not a bad price at all. Most are around £80+ but this wasn’t advertised as a PC HDD but rather a DVR HDD. What’s the difference between a PC and a DVR HDD drive? basically none, it’s all about marketing, the big boys can charge a premium for a PC HDD and people pay it, vanity pricing works for them. When I say no difference, that’s not quite true the drive was MBR formatted meaning it has 2x 2GB partitions on it because 2GB is the largest partition size MBR can work with, simple to resolve just covert it to GPT in disk management them format it with NTFS and viola a single 4GB partition. All up and running again I put the new HDD into my PC, booted into the BIOS screen, made sure the BIOS was reading the new drive which it was, save and exit then reboot PC and it’s all up and running and working fine.

terminal,"Davinci Resolve degree Tutorials Installing Karta VR If you have no idea what reframing degree videos is all about then I guess this post won’t be of any interest to you. I use an Instaone X-degree camera and most of the time I leave the video in VR format, there are however times that I need to make “flat” video from the degree video. This means I have reframe the video so that you are seeing it from a fixed angle rather than being able to scroll about, this is a serious advantage with degree video because it means I can reframe as often as I want to show the video from different camera angles. You probably still have no idea what I am talking about though but that’s OK, all will become clear when I start to upload the reframed videos. The software that comes with the camera, Instaone studio is Ok ish for reframing but not as controllable as I need it to be, so I prefer to reframe in editing software. Well, I tried Premier Pro with the GoPro reframe plug in and it constantly crashed. So, my “fallback” software in Davinci Resolve. For a free program Resolve is very powerful in many respects and reframing footage is one of those that it excels in. I am in the middle of making a tutorial about reframing in Resolve but before we can start doing that, we need to install the plug in that allows us to do this, installing plug-ins in Resolve isn’t straightforward so this tutorial is about downloading and installing KARTAVR. This video tutorial is about installing reactor 3 which allows you run KARTAVR which you need to do the reframing. Read the full article",tumblr

From my hotel In Birmingham to my front door it was miles and took me 4 hours to make the journey. Why so long? I was in no particular hurry to get home, so I just pulled in behind an HGV, set my radar-controlled cruise control to 50 meters and just cruised along doing the same speed as the lorry but with a separation of 50m I also stopped a few times in rest areas for toilet and coffee breaks, but I edited those out. Dropping in behind lorries like this and doing their speed, appx 56mph is a very economical speed and my car returned 79mpg for the journey, I could have got the mpg higher, but it was a warm day and I had the AC on for the whole journey, without the AC I could have got mpg. I didn’t actually record the journey as a hyper lapse, I recorded it in real time and used Adobe Premier Pro to speed it up from over 4 hours to just 10 minutes.

I. stand up to cancer I wanted to just share this with anyone who has just been diagnosed with cancer in the hope it may help. I know all cancers are different, a year ago this week after months of ever increasing pain in my lower back I was finally told the words that we all dread “ I’m sorry to say you have cancer” in some ways for me this was a relief in a strange kind of way at least it explained the ferocious pain I was experiencing that just got worse and worse to the point I could hardly move. For months it was diagnosed as sciatica, I guess I had the similar simptoms. It got worse when a few weeks later my world totally disintegrated when I learnt it was advanced agressive prostate cancer. The pain was from Bone Mets that has fractured my vertibrae in several places as well as limph nodes the cancer had also spread to my pelvis. I was in a bad state with no light at the end of the tunnel. I’m 55 with two daughters ages 12 & 14 , my world as well as my back was collapsing. That was a year ago. Now I’m back to work full time as an ambulance driving instructor my pain levels are managed and I’ve completely changed my life style from diet to mindset I’m a different person but in the same body. The tumours have shrunk considerably although my doctor keeps reminding me it’s incurable. They say Woody keep doing it whatever it is you are doing I steadfastly refuse to believe that it’s incurable and I refuse to let my illness become the centre of my life. My life has changed so much not all of it for the worse. I appreciate life far more than I have ever done. I’m grateful for each day and what it brings. My body has been majorly affected by hormone treatment but at least it’s keeping me living. I’m thankful for the simple things I know longer strive to have what I can’t have I’m happy contented and yet supposedly dying. Cancer is no longer the center attraction life goes on. My message is no matter what, you have to keep believing. Keep positive. I live by three things be kind to all I meet and try to make a difference in some way be grateful for what I have and stay positive no matter how bad it seems. A year ago I thought my life was over, if this is you in a similar situation don’t let the cancer take over, stand up to it and live your life the best way you can. I hope this helps someone out there. Woody",tumblr

I’m not going to sugar coat it– for americans especially, if you consider music a significant interest of yours but still feel the need to search for acceptable reasons to keep yourself ignorant of black music, or think of rap as a monolith of hate and violence and not equally as diverse as any other genre, or can only name nonblack rappers… you should be embarrassed of that. And your embarrassment should not keep you from being active about exposing yourself to unfamiliar art and broadening what you listen to. ‘I don’t understand what they’re saying/they rap too quickly’ I’m surprised by how much I keep seeing this– speed is not a stylistic trademark of most rap music, & clearer diction as a performer is much more necessary in rap than other genres? Statistically rap has a lower bpm ( here’s an example of one person’s study ) average than other genres. (of course these aren’t all-encompassing, but you can look into this yourself using sites like bpmdatabase.com ) Do you really feel overwhelmed by speed listening to Kendrick or Biggie or Nas or 2Pac, or have you never actually listened to their songs? 'I have to look up the lyrics– so what? is it a bad thing to take an extra few seconds to engage with an artist’s work? If you listen to lyrical music, do you care when it’s the artists you listen to? Why does the thoughtful art consumption everyone talks about not also apply to black art? 'there is too much violence and misogyny and commercialism’ this is not unique to rap, or true of all rap music. Artists exist that talk about other things, the way they exist in all genres. There is an entire wikipedia page listing alternative hip hop musicians and rappers if you consider seeking it out too much labo r. Click one! 'i find it unrelatable– who cares? Being unable to engage with art you don’t find wholly relatable is a deeply childish and self centered way to exist. You get on here reblogging feel good navel-gazey posts about the shared human experience and caring for one another, but a rapper talking about living with violence or poverty is stretching the limits of what you can imagine or empathize with too much for you to care about it? You don’t find that embarrassing to admit to? You don’t have to love rap, you don’t have to incorporate it into what you listen to every day, but a lot of you need to be aware you’re parroting reagan era anti-rap & antiblack) pearl-clutching talking points, and it’s a very ugly look. It isn’t racist if your favorite genre isn’t rap, but you need to do some serious self reflection if you consider it inherently less artistic, intelligent or positive than 'whiter’ genres when you don’t actually listen to it. I am looking at you, people into other counterculture genres– it’s crazy how much I see this from self-professed punks and metalheads especially lmfao. If expression, counterculture art, anti-censorship in music and the right for raw and unfiltered music to exist matters to you as much as you say you do, you should care about rap’s relationship to censorship & fight for its legitimacy just as much as what you listen to.",tumblr

It does. furbearingbrick : bliss-bliss-bliss-bliss : chromegnomes : milfbro : I will be honest guys, the Red portrait of king Charles is gorgeous asdfghjkl it’s a bad portrait. Like. Objectively. It does the opposite of what’s intended. It looks like the painter is insulting him. If it was in a contemporary gallery with no context you would see it immediately as the ambivalent criticism of Charles’s reign, how he fades into the overwhelming red background as a tiny little figure, small and insignificant, insufficient for the clothes he’s wearing. It reminds my of Goya’s portraits, how they were so ‘realistic’ that they ended up making these great figures look pathetic to the viewer. So these are our rulers? the sheer novelty. the surprise and shock, the kinda cunt it’s serving for no reason. I. I love it. It’s an incredible portrait by Jonathan Yeo. By the sheer fact that Charles, the man, is impossible to portray as greater than man because he’s just such a nothingburger of a dude. So a portrait made to make him look huge and interesting made him be swallowed in red brushstrokes. The butterfly, that reminded me immediately of “ we will all laugh at guilded butterflies, draws more attention than him. It looks like an omen. It looks like a warning in all this red. Something is not right here. This is the best royal portrait ever 10/10 This is a painting of a monarch whose individual personality and even bodily presence are a mere footnote within the legacy of bloodshed that built the throne he occupies. This is the only way it’s possible to depict him. It’s a photograph of his soul And I think all of that is entirely deliberate! I think Jonathan Yeo meant this portrait to be absolutely all of those things, he just can’t be very vocal about the paintings true meaning. Yet. I’ve done this on another post, but let’s compare that portrait up there to some other portraits Yeo’s done. Here’s actor and activist Idris Elba, whom colleagues have described as warm and friendly, open-hearted, with an emotional intelligence that makes him capable of being very honest and vulnerable with the character he’s playing: Here’s Jony Ive - who founded Apple with Steve Jobs and was chief design officer responsible for some of the more popular artistic choices, who recently left the company because the culture had gotten so toxic and shitty. He now works more in private design, so he has more artistic freedom and he can be less in the public eye: Yeo’s even previously painted British heads of state. Here’s the phenomenal Baroness Doreen Lawrence of the labour party, a Jamaican immigrant who turned the tragic murder of her son into a lifelong campaign of quietly and steadily dismantling systemic racism: To me, all these portraits are deeply personal, conveying the sitter’s character with empathy and quiet dignity. Elba is leaning forward in an intimate friendly gesture. He makes eye contact with the viewer but his face is turned slightly to the side, inviting but not confrontational, his brows slightly drawn together thoughtfully. His hands are natural and relaxed. He’s shirtless - not to be a beefcake thirst trap (okay maybe just a tiny little bit, but to convey how emotionally naked he’s willing to be. Ives is literally putting a lens between himself and the viewer - we have to look closer to see his face, but when we do we see his eyes crinkled with a hint of good humor. The perspectives are all distorted, but the main thing we see is the hands that have physically built so much of the technology we use. And even outside the phone screen he’s still enased by a circular frame within a frame, indicating yet another layer of separation between the subject and the viewer. Lawrence is radiant , proudly upright and implacable as a mountain, her head held high and her hands folded before her with a self-contained air of calm determination. And even though the background is a chaotic sea of looming shapes and quick brush strokes, her eyes keep us grounded, even pinned in place. We’re the viewer, but she is studying us. And then, on the other end of the personality spectrum, here’s noted asshole Damien Hirst, who frequently makes the news for being racist and sexist and just generally a really slimy piece of shit. His most famous works are the animal carcasses suspended in resin- -yeah, that. That guy. He’s made all the money in the goddamn world three times over for pieces like that, and he still seems like he’s on a personal mission to make everyone around him as miserable as possible. Here’s Yeo’s portrait of him, seated on a leather throne, dick bulge at eye level, contained in one of his own tanks: Here’s the droopy and melancholic portrait of the famously pompous and insufferable John Cooper Clarke, self-described “original punk poet, who was recently booed off stage for making super transphobic remarks, and whose most famous quote is “I read Kerouac at 12 and decided I could do better: And, most notably for the argument I’m making here, here’s D-Day veteran Sgt Geoffrey Pattinson, and see if you can spot the extremely subtle use of color theory here: My conclusion: Jonathan Yeo paints very good portraits, and sometimes his subjects are very bad people. And I think he brings absolutely all of his artistic talent to the Charles portrait. is absolutely right; it is the only possible way to depict him. It is a photograph of his soul. And that’s precisely why it’s so ugly and uncomfortable to look at. People have said that Charles has a “complicated legacy, which is what people say when someone has an objectively horrible legacy that they are still personally benefiting from. But the people who still tolerate his extravagant gilded existence to “honor historical tradition” will find absolutely nothing to like in this portrait. All the gold and brass and pomp of his uniform, all the military accolades for his colonial warmongering, all the fabulous ostentatious wealth he was born into and has spent every second of his life surrounded by - which would have been rendered with glittering precision and care in a traditional royal portrait - they’re all dingy and washed out and already fading. The medals aren’t even clearly marked enough to really know what they are; it’s all sound and fury, signifying nothing. The butterfly that was included as a nod to his honestly extensive conservation work (because let’s give the little bit of credit where credit is actually due) stands out as the one bright point of beauty and authenticity - but it’s dwarfed by the only other visible object, the sword, and it’s being swallowed up by that lurid, putrid background that seems to seep out of Charles’ uniform. The dark tips of its wings are the most high-contrast part of the painting except for Charles’ black hollow eyes that stare into nothing. And, most significantly in my opinion, the butterfly isn’t actually touching him , or connected to him in any way. It just exists alongside him, but it doesn’t need him. His face is painted in such a way to detail absolutely every wrinkle without ever being able to completely cover up the blood red background, and below the sunken shark-like eyes, the artist has included that vapidly pleasant plastered-on smile with nothing behind it that is practically the royal uniform by now. I think the angle is also deliberately chosen to be unsettling: many portraits are traditionally done either head-on, ¾ profile, or full profile. Charles is none of these - his head is tilted juuust a few degrees off kilter. It’s not quite right. And he’s looking off to the side very slightly; his thousand-yard-stare is kind of drifting over the viewers shoulder. He can’t look us in the eye. And there is no way, there is absolutely no possible way that an artist who is smart enough and skilled enough to imbue all his other portraits with so much meaning and symbolism and indicators of the subject’s character - there’s no way that’s not intentional. But… Yeo lives in London. He’s still working on other royal and aristocratic portraits. He still has to live in that society, and he still has to get paid. So of course he has to toe the line, at least until Charles dies, and say that the vivid blood-soaked red is to symbolize the “vibrancy” of this terminally ill octogenarian, to bring a “modern contemporary feel” to this 19th century colonizer. Yeo knows exactly what he’s doing. Here’s an excerpt about it from Smithsonian magazine : The king saw the painting when it was about halfway done. Yeo tells BBC News’ Katie Razzall that Charles was “mildly surprised by the strong color, but otherwise he seemed to be smiling approvingly” He adds that when Camilla saw the portrait, she said, “Yes, you’ve got him” Listen, I work in memory care and end-of-life care, and we only say someone “seems to be smiling approvingly” to comfort the family when someone is so far gone they clearly don’t know where they are anymore. His ex-wife Camilla, who probably has more good reasons to hate him than any other single human being alive, looked at this haunting vision of hell and was like YES PERFECT. This is all completely intentional. We are all picking up on exactly the message the artist was trying to convey. Yeo is trying to tell us, loud and clear, that something is not right here. It is absolutely an omen. Op is right; it is insulting him. And it is supposed to make us look at this pathetic villain, who is currently toddling through the final days of his unfairly long and lavishly useless life, and think “ these are our rulers”",tumblr

What I learned is that there is an inflexible rule about how people interact with systems. If your system would work perfectly if people Just Would, and yet they Don’t, then your system is bad and you should feel bad. Systems must be built with an eye toward “will people actually do this? Recycling was a thing when I was a child. (The 70’s) In my home in New York State, you could carry recyclables to a recycling center. Nobody did. Now in Baltimore there is a trash truck that comes every week to pick up my recyclables, and I and my neighbors fill our cans with objects that can be recycled, because a system was developed that was easy for busy people to do, and there’s a lot of social pressure to do it – but the social pressure wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t easy to do. Only the most crunchy granola people bitched at you if you didn’t recycle in , when it required a lot of effort. Now it is considered kind of on par with spitting in the street or leaving a dirty diaper on the diaper changing table in the bathroom instead of throwing it out, if you don’t recycle. Your job as the system creator is to make it as easy as possible for people to do the right thing, and as hard as possible to do the wrong thing. This is why web forms have data validation (but too much data validation actually makes the forms harder, so hit the spot in the middle) And if you want people to adopt social change, whether it’s environmentalism, accepting gay people, or whatever, make it as easy as possible. And don’t guilt people about not doing it until it’s as easy as possible; instead phrase things more like “wouldn’t it be cool if. It’s not the fault of the individual that they can’t get things done in a bad system.

If you get a message from an account claiming to be a Palestinian fundraiser, it is a bot. It is a scam. You need to report & delete the message and encourage others to do the same. I know because I get messages on this account DAILY. I have a very high follower count and I’m pretty active and I interact with my followers a lot, and apparently that all adds up to one big bot magnet. Bots following and messaging this account was a MASSIVE problem before Tumblr fixed its new account policies. I used to spend literally hours blocking and reporting the hundreds of bots that I would get following me each day. I learned a lot about bots and how to identify them. The easiest way is with no avatar, “untitled” in the blog description (BTW if your avatar is still set to default PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD change it because you run a substantial risk of being accidentally blocked & reported as a bot. One of the dead give aways of a bot was what I call “word salad” names. Three seemingly random words strung together making no sense, always adjective, adjective or noun, noun. If you reported a lot of these bots, you’d notice the same words kept showing up. Nowadays, I am bombarded with fundraiser requests and sometimes, they don’t even bother to hide the fact that they’re a bot. The avatar is default, the blog title is “untitled” and the blog name is a classic randomly-generated word salad. However MOST of the requests I get come from at least semi-legit looking accounts. There are pictures, a name, a story. Never mind that I’ve gotten that message three times from different accounts. Sometimes, they claim to be vetted, but the whole vetting system essentially adds up to “trust me bro” There is no way of guaranteeing that this account isn’t just lying about being vetted, claiming to be vetted by a false person, or are using the identity of a real Palestinian to scam people. Previously, I’ve seen a lot of people getting attacked for raising questions about these fundraisers and getting attacked for being racist or for harming Palestinian families in danger, like Tumblr isn’t a website famous for its scams and the words “The Arkh Project” “All or Nothing” or “Miss Officer and Mr. Truffles” mean nothing to you. I personally have been scammed by people claiming to be charities on Tumblr before, specifically, The Leelah Project which used the name of a trans teenager who died by suicide to swindle people out of their money. Luckily, there are actual, respected charities out there you can give money to if you want to help the cause: Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund Palestine Red Crescent Society United Nations Relief Works Agency Islamic Relief World Central Kitchen Médecins Sans Frontièrs One of the hardest things to accept about the situation in Palestine is that realistically, there is very little that your average outsider can do to change it. However, these large, well-respected and trustworthy charities are out there doing the hard work to keep people alive, and should be where the donation money is going These scam bots feed on people’s naïvety and need to believe that they are making a difference, and even worse, feed on the fear that by ignoring them, it somehow makes you a racist doing direct harm to a refugee family, when in fact they are using the suffering of Palestinians to take away money from those in need. As far as fundraisers that don’t send out random asks for donations, I honestly don’t know. You’ll have to do the work yourself and approach with much caution. Be careful out there.",tumblr

Pies cool on the counter top as I shut the dishwasher and start the cycle, then put the last of the big pans in the dish rack. I hang my apron in the broom closet and went to the pantry, getting the Bosco from the shelf, then the milk from the fridge. “Are you making hot cocoa” “Yes” “Some for us, too, please” “Okay” I have no idea who ‘us’ might be, but the TV room seats four, and I can see one chair empty. Going back and forth, I see bare trees, grey skies, and the winter river with a skim of ice. “It’s going to snow” “Not yet. Don’t worry” I’m homesick as I haven’t been for over 40 years.",tumblr
terminal,"Found the f*cking spider Found the f*cking spider After tearing apart and moving everything that could be torn apart or moved, I found the spider on the wall next to the bathroom door yesterday. It was brown, perhaps the size of a nickel with legs. It spayed it with canned air keyboard cleaner until it was frosty, then scooped it up with the kittys’ barf spatula. It was duly conveyed to the toilet where I dumped it in and flushed. A lot. Just to be sure. Look, I get the whim-whams and jim-jams just by looking at images of spiders, okay? I hope this is the end of spider incursions. I understand that they are beneficial insects and they keep down other non-beneficial insects. However, rattlesnakes might keep down rodents, but I am not letting one free in the house.",tumblr

terminal,"Ezra's reckoning Ezra’s reckoning He knew about Thrawn’s crew, of course. In general, they did not come planetside and preferred to spend their money at the Imperial depot’s commissary and PX. He knew about Thrawn’s SWO, possibly the only officer in the Navy who could shoot. Of course, that was a joke, as the Seventh didn’t seem to tolerate inefficiency or (Kassius Konstantine exempted) incompetence. Now that he was Back, it seemed that Thrawn’s officers had blown through the galaxy and taken root like scatterpuff seeds. Faro, Marinith, Hammerly, Barlin, Agral, Lomar, Yve, and Pyrondi were now everyone’s flag-ranked problems. Pyrondi - the Dragon - in particular. He couldn’t pull off the Purgill again. The Third Fleet followed Grand Admiral Pyrondi as the Seventh had Thrawn. The Chimaera ’s etched ventral was matched by Pyrondi’s dragon on the Imperial lll classed Audacity . It was her name, her flagship, and her reputation. Even the fleet patch carried the motto, “Firing Solution: The Shortest Distance between Two Points’ It also seemed that nobody much wanted to talk about her. Her entire file including planet of origin was redacted, but there were still clues. He matched images of her in civilian to some of tribal members hundreds of years old - she was more than likely from a place named Jegsziv. A world that was also redacted, and did not appear on any map, anywhere unless you went back to a half-millennia old TaggeCo survey reporting a ‘recovered colony’ world named Dzeghsziv. Mothma and others from Before the Empire led with keeping their mouths shut, and a circle of misdirection that made Ezra feel he was a supporting cast member in a clown show. To be fair, the New Republic did not leave him with the sweet taste of victory. If this was what the Old Republic was like, no wonder it fell. The New Republic just seemed to be the Empire in new clothes. The planets with fewer resources and further from Coruscant got the shaft while the richer systems cut the pie for themselves. The Trident Fleet - the Eleventh, Seventh, and Third - held a huge section of the Outer Rim, Wild Space, and strategic parts of the Mid-Rim, having brought the Seswennas into the fold recently, and offering protection for resources. The Trident Fleet contained more than that from massive numbers of defectors. Two other fleets defected almost intact. The Sixth was primarily an engineering fleet, and the Twelfth an expeditionary and supply fleet. Other disaffected personnel made it to the Trident Fleet from every other fleet as well. Some even made it from the survivors of Death Squadron and the First Fleet - all but obliterated at Endor. From everything he could find, the Tridents ran their territories well, if with military efficiency. He spoke with Zeb, Hera, and Kallus. ""You can’t argue with someone on the other side of a closed blast door, Ezra, and all of the principal actors had their reasons for joining” Kallus would spend the rest of his life under house arrest, despite his defection and work for the Alliance after that. “A lot of them remember the CIS talking points being similar to what the Republic says now. They backed the GAR when it was them and wanted to go back to the old rules after everyone paid in blood to take out Dooku and Grevious” Hera and the others watched him and Ezra reflected that everyone else had moved on, but he was still who he was when he left. “Pyrondi… the Intel Committee has limited what I can say” “Why” Kallus looked at his hands, then made a washing motion. “It’s okay if we do it” “Do what” Ezra looked at his friends, angry. “When we do what? What have 'we’ done that nobody talks about” He stormed out after evasive answers, went back to his room overlooking the Amnesty Lodging and went to bed. In the middle of his sleeping shift, Ezra woke up with a thought banging him in the frontal lobes. Why do you have to wash your hands? Because they’re dirty . Kallus and Zeb were not there when he went back the next day.",tumblr

I know this is my brain’s way of trying to process everything that’s happened, but the sleep disturbance is hard to deal with. I’ll have a run of good sleep, and then nightmares busting out of the cracks. My shrink tells me it’s more common than anyone imagines. She’s a good shrink, very to the point, and constantly tells me that the things I am going through - as much as they suck - are normal. It’s comforting not to be the only one. The last round of nightmares edged into night terrors with a side of waking paralysis. Spiders, claustrophobia, missing cats, then in the dream I watched black tumors erupting from my body and knew I was dying. I couldn’t use lucid dreaming, the terror was too overwhelming for thought, I just managed to wake myself up. I was awake for hours, even switching from bed to couch didn’t send me back to sleep. I didn’t want to take a Ramelteon (works on serotonin receptors and is non-addictive) or an Ativan (asked Onco to order me a couple for my MRI because of claustrophobia and now have a bottle of , so I was up from 2:00AM onwards.

Biofeedback has always struck me as the wooiest woo, but I am old and now it’s an evidence-based treatment. I’ll give it a shot, but in the meantime my gabapentin dose gets a bump. I can’t believe that in these times, people want to censor talk about mortality, death, dying, and the process of disease, treatment, and so on. Skip the next paragraph if you’re that extra. I talked with her about The End. I said it was kind of comforting to have a general idea of what would kill me. I am okay with the concept of my mortality. It’s not the end, but getting there that’s the Big Scary. I’ve seen that part of the trip. I’ve prepared for it was much as possible, but in the end… well… we find out, don’t we? Only 15 percent of people diagnosed with my type and stage of cancer come out the other end of chemo and radiation. Twenty people walk into a room and three will walk back out.

I can do things now that I lost the ability to do after chemo/radiation/surgery. I am partially disabled and I can accept that now. From having an autoimmune disorder to the unimaginable it’s-happening-to-me experience of cancer, I never comprehended how much I would lose, or at when I was at the very worst how much I would regain. We’re supposed to bounce back. We’re supposed to emerge from cancer like a victorious warrior from battle. We emerge, we lucky few, but we don’t come out unscarred, unscathed, or unchanged. The battle for our lives leaves us changed forever in ways we never calculated. Small milestones.

Most times, if I find them alive, I wet a swab with honey water and let them drink. If they’re really out of it, I put them in a safe place. I have a mesh dish cover, put them on clean toweling, with a little honey-water station. Most times it’s just a bee that got too far from home, or is suffering from heat or cold. I get the joy of setting them free and watching them fly away. Other times, it’s a bee kicked out of the colony. Old. It’s time of year for it. She hung on to the swab weakly, and when she fell, I caught her in my hand to bring her inside. I set up the ‘bee hospital’ She ate and drank, but was so weak. She felt and tasted my pinky tip, buzzed her wings, and settled on the toweling. I figured she’d rest and I’d let her go in the morning. Normally, when you find a dead bee, they’ve curled up and died, thrashing in unknowable sensations. I went to look in on her and found her in what I think of as a sleeping bee position. Until I noticed her wings spread and unmoving in final flight. Sometimes, as hard as you fight, as hard as others fight for you, there is not one more day. I’ve walked with my mortality for a couple of years now. Each day is one more gift, each day is powerful, what can you do, what would you do with one more day. A little life, an almost invisible, and some would say an insignificant life. Still deserving of kindness, and a safe place to spread her wings in her final flight. It hit me hard, as things do.

terminal,"The Exit The Exit Not now. Calm down. Do I need to TW for a discussion of medically assisted suicide? Damned if I will censor myself for discussing it. Don’t click the read-more if you’re offended. I’ve been thinking a lot about death (fuck cancer, how it comes, it’s permutations. The first introduction I had to close-range mortality was of one of my middle school friends, hit by a car while walking to school. The driver was drunk and behind the wheel after going to a local bar that opened at 6:00AM. He had breakfast and three boilermakers, then got in his car. There was no goodbye, just a brutal and senseless excision of a 12-year-old girl from the fabric of the world. Snip. Gone. Energy dispersed. Closed coffin. Between the AIDs epidemic, drugs and alcohol, physical disorders and disease, sepsis, misdiagnosis, suicide, I have had a lot of phone calls. If you live long enough, you know a lot of people who are not here any longer. This plays into a bit of news about the Sarco suicide pod, and I have thoughts. We all will get there eventually. I do not blame people who are suffering and want to meet their end on their own terms. MAID is available in California, and I have discussed it with my oncologist. I am not there yet, but the possibility is that I will get to the point where I will be eligible and more to the point where I am ready. When I simply exist, when there is no joy in anything, and uncontrollable pain - that’s my personal choice. I have Big Issues with ideology, the way that euthanasia proponents push death like doctors push Ozempic, or pushed Oxycodone, and the way that it’s turning into a class issue where the inability to afford long-term care or even hospice results in okey-dokey-artichokey, off you go. Medical aid in dying has turned into getting people off the books as I feared it would. My stepfather’s hospice care 20 years ago was a circus of zealous glassy-eyed deathbots. My friends in the late 80s and early 90s suffering from HIV were cared for in the community, and if you have to die it sucks less with someone holding your hand, honoring your humanity with theirs. My mother was cared for by a religious hospice service, and they were wonderful. They followed the pre-need orders to the letter, and she died safe and as comfortable as possible. The pod. When ideology meets financing, that’s not a slippery slope - it’s a tightrope. The suicide pod on the surface is a win. You get in the pod, seal it, push a button, and off you go. I do not doubt that the woman who used it was suffering. Hypoxia is thought to be a painless way to die, but as with all endings, nobody knows what’s happening in the dying person’s perception. The pod costs $60K, is out of reach for anyone but the wealthy, or will cost one’s life savings (of which the principals for the Sarco allegedly fleeced one woman previously) for those without the means. It’s 3D printed, untested - unless you count the first user. $60K. Cash. I get that the American medical system is a clusterfuck and even at its best, there are still issues of access in addition to issues of race, class, and gender. The system alone can make you want to quit. I’ve been diagnosed as female for decades, and even with a diagnosis in hand, you’re still high-handed by those you’re hiring to care for your body. In many cases you don’t have a choice of doctor, or even the ability to see a doctor. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners are the gatekeeper class, doctors barely have fifteen minutes to spend with you. Minimums of care are not being met and I can’t shake the feeling that the 64-year-old woman was ill-served by her own medical providers and her family. It was hard to step back and let Mom’s directives take over. You want to DO SOMETHING. Perhaps in their shoes, I would do the same, even drive Mom to the airport - though some states make that an offense as an accessory. There’s a difference between feeling bad because you’re depressed and being depressed because you’re feeling bad. That is a difference nobody has ever understood until I met my cancer team and pain doctor. The thing is, I don’t want someone making their exit to do so for someone’s profit margin any more than I want life-saving, life-changing treatment reduced to a line in an insurance company computer. Dying is the point where, as someone said, we cease to be biology and become physics. That is a profound change. It needs to be honored instead of commodified and doled out with ten-keys (do they use those any longer) clicking in the background. Huckstering custom-printed push-button death is not a philosophy, or ‘helping with a choice, it’s murder for money. I’m sorry, Lady in the Forest, that it got to that point. I am glad that you went on terms of your own. I hope that you were not failed so drastically that your back was to the wall and this was your only way out. Be at peace.",tumblr

terminal,"WIP bit: Reckoning WIP bit: Reckoning It gave him something to do. Kallus and Zeb left, Hera and Jacen looked about to go anywhere but Coruscant. Ezra collected retroactive combat pay and - in a move that unsettled him deeply - a bonus for his actions at Lothal. Not so much his actions, but his kill count. He tried to explain the last decade with Thrawn and failed miserably to bring anyone around to more than, “Hurhurhur, blue man smart and bad” One chucklehead publicly proposed invading the Ascendancy, but Chancellor Organa shut it down fast. She wanted him to meet with her brother, with other Jedi, but Ezra was hesitant. Everyone moved on, except him. “I want to go talk to Pyrondi” He didn’t know he intended to say it. It just fell out of his mouth and stirred a thunderwasps’ nest. Oops. “We go back a long way” She’s tried to kill him, though they never met. “Ilyana Pyrondi will as soon shoot you as look at you - and that’s if you’re lucky. She’s one of Thrawn’s proteges, part of the corps that left the Seventh with Faro minutes before the Purgill showed up” Hera didn’t shout, exactly. She had to speak loudly over Chopper’s cursing. “Could you not get yourself killed within a month of getting back, Ezra” “I want to ask why she’s the most classified person I’ve ever seen” Mothma kept her face smooth, a politician’s mask. “Since nobody here’s handing out anything more than a runaround” Chancellor Organa looked right at Mothma. “Her file was sealed by the Senate” “The Chancellor has the authority to unseal it, right? No? Why? You’re the Chancellor” Ezra threw up his hands, anger coming quickly. “Why in the hell is everyone avoiding knowing the enemy? What the hell did the Senate do that they’re so ashamed of that they don’t want anyone to know for six centuries” “It’s not that simple. There has to be a quorum before I can unseal it - and I don’t have one” Ezra looked that word up and snorted. “Then I want to ask Pyro herself” “She… may not be able to talk about it” The older man was a clone representative named Sevs and while Ezra might be a bonehead, he did have some empathy. “The Senate could have ordered the survivors chipped” “The survivors of what? Why happened to turn her into someone who could talk a whole fleet into mass suicide” Ezra was alarmed when the man’s hand went to his head. “Ser Sevs? Are you all right” “Genocide. It was genocide” Sevs gasped, eyes rolling and wide with agony, shoulder spasming. “Gerrera did it. We covered it up. They ch-ch-ch” “Get a kriffing medic! What the hell is wrong with you people” Ezra’s heart sees Rex, Gregor, and Wollfe. He bolted out of his chair, reaching for the old man. “Easy. I’ve got you. I’ll get the chip” “Always… slaves… We are… always…slaves” Ezra saw it in his heart, hooked into the body’s neural net like a parasite. A guard reached for him, telling him to move away. “Touch me, touch him, and I will kill you. I’ve killed so many that you’ll just be one more” His hand rested over the chip and in the Force he started to unravel the web of pain and compulsion. “Touch him and I kill you” Hera. Bless Mom. “Medics are on the way” “General Syndulla, it’s not that easy” The Bothan guy. His signature in the Force was like greasy food that gave you a bellyache. “There are nuances to consider, and consequences. Please believe that no harm is intended” “Harm doesn’t have to be intentional to happen. The term is ‘collateral damage’ if I remember correctly” There. That’s it. Filaments only particles thick start retracting, withdrawing into the chip, Ezra fumbles to soothe the damage left behind. Sevs grips his arm, eyes wide in wonder. “I want him in protective custody. Call my brother. I also want to know why a prohibited control device is implanted in an elected representative to the Senate - and how many others there are” “Chancellor Organa. Leia. Please” “Senator Mothma, if you and others want to start explaining, now’s the time. Tell me things I don’t know. Start with Senator Sevs”",tumblr

That would have taken a couple hours. I have braided leather before, and it takes a lot of time and effort. It may have even taken more than one day, all scripture says is, “And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple“ there isn’t a time period given. But I would still say it was at least a few hours. he had to braid multiple cords, bind them together, make a handle, and fix the cords to the handle. The point of this is that what he did was NOT impulsive. It was cold and calculated. Premeditated even. I’m sorry I know this is a really great insight but all I can think of is Jesus sitting there making His whip and the apostles shuffling around nervously wondering who’s about to get it Honestly what’s going through my head is just. Apostles: You’re back early Jesus: Temple’s infested. Apostles: What? Jesus - like three hours later - *cracks whip: Temple’s infested. 🤣 It wasn’t just chasing people with a whip, it was chasing capitalists from a temple. Just saying. An excellent point ! Christians who base their religious beliefs on the New Testament seem to vigorously ‘forget’ that Jesus was unswervingly kind to the poor, the weak, the hungry and the stranger, while being totally unforgiving to those who exploit and demean their fellow humans.

They have some judgy neighbors though, who didn’t love foulmouthed Cosmo, and who secretly captured him and took him to an animal rescue. He was eventually released far from from home. When he came to this school? When he walked through all the classrooms telling the kids “what’s up” and “I’m fine? He was looking for someone who could help him find his family . “He went to the only kid I know in Allen Dale and knocked on the door” Shattuck said. That was the fifth-grade classroom where Cosmo found snacks. That night, when the kid relayed the story of the talking crow to his father, the father called Shattuck. Colpron went the next day to collect Cosmo. Cosmo’s home now, he was welcomed back and fed sardines, he doesn’t visit the traitor neighbors anymore, and those kids got to take part in a wonderful story about friendship, corvid intelligence, and Christmas magic.

terminal,"When your thoughts are not your own We all have our “moments” when the mind goes blank or we say to ourselves “what the hell was I thinking” Those are just the everyday occurrences in our world of multitasking, non-stop stimulation, and too much stress. Before cancer, I would never let those moments cause much concern. But now? It concerns me a lot. It seems that every step along the treatment path has a cost in terms of mental acuity and clarity. Or in other words, I feel like I’m slowly losing my mind. In the first meeting with Deepak, my Oncologist, he focused in on what I did for a living. Lots of questions about decision making, critical thinking, stuff like that. He explained that hormone (Testosterone) suppression would have a significant impact on the part of my brain that handles executive functioning. He was pretty blunt that it might not be possible to mentally function at the high level required by my job. It was bad enough that in the same meeting we were also talking about my limited life expectancy but to hear that the treatments would mess with my brain? Shit… Of course there were several other nasty side effects to consider but that one really got my attention. In a classic denial response, the idea that I might not be able to do my job was almost more of a concern than being told to get my affairs in order… But it was the first line treatment and hopefully the best (no way I could wrap my head around chemo at that point) way to slow do the progression of the disease. So I brushed aside his predictions of functional demise and forged on. I made it for almost three years before accepting reality and throwing in the towel on my career. The slow erosion of those mental skills that made me so good at what I did spiked as I went through chemo. I was falling further and further behind and having a difficult time keeping all the balls in the air. In academia there is a time honored tradition of people staying way past their expiration date… I decided to not be one of them and closed out things as gracefully and quickly as possible. Fast forward to now, almost a year later and the erosion process hasn’t slowed down. There have been more drugs added to my cocktail and the cumulative effects of that, chemo brain, and time, has reduced me to a shadow (or so I feel) or my former self. Friends tell me they don’t see any difference on the outside but then again, they are friends… I wouldn’t expect them to be honest, why make me feel even worse? Pretty sure I’m not imagining this. Even the effort to write things like this almost makes me break out in a sweat. It is so difficult to organize the thoughts. Writing was a big part of what I did, I was really good at it. Now it feels like a form of mental torture. It takes so much effort to write anything resembling an articulate thought. And then the title of this, “when your thoughts are not your own” It’s a daily occurrence. I find myself thinking or saying things that are not at all what I mean or believe. Prednisone makes me angry and manic, Gabapentin makes things foggy, Lupron makes me endlessly indecisive, Zytiga, shit. I don’t know what the hell that’s doing. And chemo brain seems stronger than ever almost a year later. Sometimes I stop dead in my tracks and listen in disbelief to what is happening inside my head. It makes me feel like I’m not “me” anymore.",tumblr

I’m walking down one of our neighborhood streets and there are some enormous puddles because the snow was melting like crazy. Some of them spanned the whole street from one side to the other. As I approached one of these small ponds… a car was heading towards me. I moved off to the side as far from the water as I could get, fully expecting the car to slow down. I’m looking directly at the driver and she never even registered the water, hitting it at full-speed. A tsunami of muddy water washes over me… We’re talking soaked from head to toe. I turn to yell and obscenely gesture, expecting the car to have slowed down, and it’s speeding off as if nothing happened! As I’m standing there trying to squeegee the water and mud off of myself, wait for it… another car comes zooming along. SPLASH! Good thing I was on the back side of my morning Prednisone dose or I would have turned into a psychotic maniac… But this time the driver stopped and apologized, even offering me some paper towels.

Trying to keep the words of my Oncology NP front and center… She said they (the numbers) are going to move around and that I have to expect things like this to happen. She also told me to NOT FREAK OUT! Trying… But my lipid profile was quite good so at least all the drugs haven’t screwed that up. The reason labs have become so stressful is the length of time (approaching a year) I’ve been on Zytiga. That’s the drug that is keeping things under control right now. It’s a given that eventually the cancer will mutate and circumvent it, and then I will be down to one last androgen suppression drug to try. After that, it’s back to chemo. Zytiga is so new that there isn’t a lot of long term usage data. Initially they told me it could work anywhere from a few months to two or three years. But with such aggressive disease, I’ve burned through other drugs at an alarming rate. So of course, any upward movement makes we worry that it’s about to stop working. Fear. It’s about the future.
