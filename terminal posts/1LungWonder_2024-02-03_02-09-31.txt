I was diagnosed with terminal cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma  18 years ago.. We sought out the world’s leading specialist in the disease and he saved my life. I had surgery to remove my lung , had heated chemo during surgery, had 4 sessions of chemo and 30 sessions of radiation .. and it worked. They told me I had 15 months to live. 
I always say survivorship is a shitshow.. it certainly isn’t what I expected, but I am forever grateful to still be here, even with all of the lasting issues due to my surgery and treatment . 
Someone told me that gratitude and grief can exist in the same place at the same time, and that really helped me to sort through all of the emotions that come with surviving cancer… 
I just wanted to celebrate with others who understand …
