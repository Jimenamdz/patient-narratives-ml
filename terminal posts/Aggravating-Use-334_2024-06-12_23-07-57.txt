Title: Stage 4 nsclc adenocarcinoma, need hope

Hi everyone, last week my grandmother (78) was diagnosed with nsclc, we thought we caught it early due to lack of symptoms, her main symptoms being fatigue and stomach pain. ( No cough, no breathlessness etc). However we got the unfortunate news that it was stage 4(a) and “incurable”. I am utterly heartbroken it has got to this stage and right now I don’t really know what to expect. She only has one kidney as she donated the other to save my uncles life nearly 9 years ago and because of this I am worried it will effect her treatment. For her age she is healthy despite the cancer and this is partly why it’s came as a huge shock to us. She is also a non smoker.

If there is anybody in here that could give me any sort of hope that treatment can prolong her life, or any sucess stories please share as I would be grateful. 

Wishing everyone the best and prayers❤️
