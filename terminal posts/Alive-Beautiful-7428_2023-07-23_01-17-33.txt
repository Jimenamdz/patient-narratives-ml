Hey, 

I was diagnosed with a a rare ovarian cancer at 24 years old and have been dealing with this for over 5 years now. I have been with my now husband for 3 years and I am fortunate that when I was told I was terminal 7 weeks ago, instead of running away, he married me and we have now been married 6 weeks. (Planned a wedding in 9 days, it was a lot of fun)

I don't know how long I have left due to the nature of the cancer but I am doing palliative chemo and procedures to keep me going.

Its my husband's birthday in 3 weeks and I know this will be the last one with him so I need to get him a gift that will hopefully last longer than me (sorry ðŸ˜‚)

I'm pretty bad at gift giving under normal circumstances so I really could use some help with this. 

His favourites things are; cars, motorbikes, the colour red, maritime history, movies/cinema/dvd collecting, videogames, vinyl collecting and horology. 

He has specifically told me to not buy him a watch because he has too many of them. 

I recently took up knitting and I'm knitting him a pillow that will have a voice recording in it telling him I love him but I know that won't last forever. 

Any gift suggestions would be really helpful! Budget is around Â£200 but can go more depending on the gift. I have also booked us a weekend away for his birthday which I'm hoping doesn't get wrecked by chemo. 

TLDR; Been dealing with a rare cancer for 5 years, found out I was terminal 7 weeks ago. Need a special gift suggestion for my husband's birthday in 3 weeks.
