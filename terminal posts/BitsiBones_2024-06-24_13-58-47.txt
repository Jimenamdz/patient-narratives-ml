Title: Had a shock today

Content:
I have cervical cancer with metastasis to my lungs (just 5 small nodules). 

When I found out how small and few my lung nodules were I was delighted, it explained why I was so well physically, and reassured me that I wasn't at death's door or anything. I know I'm terminal but because I'm basically fine physically I felt I was 'living with a terminal illness' rather than actively dying.

Today I had a phonecall following my routine 3-month scans (about a week ago) from my oncology nurse telling me I had cancer in my spine. It was an absolute shock. I asked if I was going to become paralysed and to my shock she just said, yes. We can try to postpone it with a 'single section' radiotherapy (which I'm having on Friday).

It was the one thing I never considered. I thought my lung nodules would probably get worse and I would go down the lung cancer path. The next location my type of cancer usually spreads to is the liver, and my liver is still fine. The possibility of it spreading to my spine was never even considered.

Suddenly one phonecall and I'm going to become paralysed before I die, maybe even quite soon. Having a panic - my home isn't wheelchair friendly, and I live with my elderly mother..I look after her, she can't look after me. And who will look after her? How will it happen, will I gradually lose sensation, or function, how does it happen? 

I feel lost. It's a shock out of the blue. It was lung cancer I was mentally prepared for. That's all, I suppose.
