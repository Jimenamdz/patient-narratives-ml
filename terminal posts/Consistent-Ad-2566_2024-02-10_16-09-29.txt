It's been 5 days that I lost my mother to cancer. Being a medical student i am not sure how i am coping and want to ask few questions that are bothering me a lot.

1) we were told by our doctor not to tell her that this is terminal illness being her fourth cancer and we pretended all the time she will get fine. Last two days she was sedated only. Will she be angry to me that i hid that fact from her?

2) sometimes i do not feel like crying and being sad around people. Is it normal? I love my
Mom so much, she is my world. Should i be crying all day?

3) I see few of my family members doing sometimes their work that they do for living, i have stopped everything because i feel it is bad to think about other things. Is it bad to do other things or move on?

Please help!
