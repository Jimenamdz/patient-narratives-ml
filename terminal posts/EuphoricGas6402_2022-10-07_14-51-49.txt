Title: Confused about stage 4. Is it always terminal?

Hi everyone,

Sorry to find you here but I do really appreciate the shared knowledge and support found in this group.

I (F 33) was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer 11 months ago. At the time I was told I would have 6 months without treatment and ideally 18-24 months with chemo. I have a large primary tumour in the sigmoid colon and mets to the liver (80% is tumour/necrotic), lungs and all through my lymph nodes so surgery is not an option. My heart is also dysfunctional, apparently due to being anaemic for so long and my body over-compromising. Apparently my particular mutation means fewer treatment options.

I hear many heartening stories about people living for years with stage 4 cancer and some reaching NED status. I keep asking different people on my treatment team about my prognosis and I’ve never had a sunnier outcome than 2 years. This includes 3 different oncology opinions on my paperwork to access my TPD/life insurance.

My question is; why is some stage 4 cancer terminal and some curable? Is it whether surgery is possible? The particular mutation? Size and progression of the mets? All of the above? I am aware this may be a dense question because to be honest, I don’t always understand cancer but would truly appreciate your help in making sense of things.

TIA
