Title: How do I respond to religious people saying I can pray my cancer away?

Content:
I have terminal cancer and the amount of religious people who tell me that I can be cured by prayer is crazy. Personally I am agnostic, but even if I did believe the same religion as them, it’s still terrible that they will say that to me unprompted. 

(To be fair I’ve been told that drinking lavender oil and goats milk everyday will also cure my cancer so it’s not just religious people.)

Does anyone have some good advice and/or joke responses to these people?
