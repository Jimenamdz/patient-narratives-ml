[Update #10 is here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/coloncancer/comments/mxn1xw/update_10_back_at_home_dealing_with_lots_of_blood/)

It seems to take forever on information when you are waiting on it! So, my wife and I sat together at our computer monitor, and the oncologist went over the tumor/lymphatic pathology reports.

**Surgery Summary**Surgeons removed my Terminal Ileum, Appendix, Ascending Colon and Transverse Colon (EXTENDED   RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY):-    Poorly differentiated   adenocarcinoma of the colon, 2.1 cm-   Tumor invaded into the peri-colonic soft tissue-   One extramural vessel in the pericolic fat contains tumor-   Resection margins free of tumor-   Seventeen lymph nodes; negative for malignancy (0/17)-   Tattoo ink identified-   Pathologic TNM Classification (8th ed. AJCC): **pT3pN0**\-   Fibrous obliteration of the appendix-   Lipomatosis of the ileocecal valve

**The Good news!** Docs removed all cancer. Seventeen lymph nodes removed, seventeen cancer-free.

**The ‘Hold on, not so fast” news!**The surgeon thinks the tumor was poorly differentiated and I made still need chemo because the tumor actually had burst into the intestinal tract at the Right Hepatic Flexure.

The oncologist says I am in a “gray zone.” Without chemo, I face a 70% chance of being cancer-free in five years. With chemo, that percentage increase to a 75% chance of being cancer-free in five years. Of course, he said, I would be under continual monitoring and testing for the next five years. He says, at most, I would receive 4 sessions of chemo over a three-month period. He’s leaving the choice of chemo up to me.

**My Thoughts**By agreeing to chemo, I also add to the “pros” the idea that I am doing EVERYTHING in my power to fight this monster. Yes, I am going to begin chemo in about three to four weeks.

*I learned two new words today, actually…the names of two new medicines for which I am about to be completely too familiar.*

**TLDR**: On 4-27-21, I had a video visit involving 16 min record review and 17 min of a video visit. I had successful surgery (extended right hemicolectomy), and the doc and I discussed my **Stage 2 T3 N0 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (tumor)** and the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy. I decided to proceed with **XELOX x 4 cycles.**
