I'll be 31 in two weeks (happy frickin birthday me), and I've been fighting cancer for just over 3 years. I inherited it from my mom, and it started in my colon/rectum and then it was in my liver and now lungs.

I followed all the instructions, did all the treatments, but my doctor told me last week I have another year or two left. This whole week has been a constant assault on my mental health. I'm terrified, like, absolutely scared out of my mind. During the day I can distract myself with activities and talking to friends, but at night? I can't sleep, I can't turn off my brain, I have panic attacks. I'm just so exhausted.

Every little cough or anything feeling that's out of the normal terrifies me and reminds me that this isn't just a bad dream.

I don't want to die. I'm too young! I just finished baking school before my diagnosis, I landed an awesome job at a doughnut shop that pays and treated me like a human being. Life was looking good for once. I wanted to fall in love, get married, buy a house, have a kid, go on vacation, have anniversaries, grow old.

The only thing I'm thankful for is that this is happening to me and not my brother who already has his life together with a loving wife and their own place. If one of us had to inherent this disease, I'm glad it was me.

But I really just want to live. So badly. I'd do anything to grow old.
