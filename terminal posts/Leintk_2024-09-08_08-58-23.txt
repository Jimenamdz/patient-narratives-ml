I'm depressed. I have stage 4 lung cancer at 24 and I really am not enjoying life lately.. Before I got diagnosed I was the type of person to work really hard towards achieving my goals and dreams with massive emphasis on long term. I was the type of person to totally be down to sacrifice the enjoyment of my 20s to live good 30's and onwards. I'm the type of person where if I feel like I'm not working towards accomplishing something then I will get depressed. Well now with this disease it's been stripped from me and I'm just really lost at what to do.

  
I stopped my classes, I don't work, and I stopped running my business. I have enough money for the rest of my life so finances aren't an issue, but now all I do all day is consume media and play video games and occasionally hang out with friends and family. In theory it doesn't sound that bad, but with my type of personality it gets old quite fast. 

  
But unfortunately there's literally no point to working towards anything meaningful because I am going to die in a couple years so why even do it. I'm never going to be married or have kids.. I'm going to spend the rest of my life just doing nothing. Idk sorry if this was a hard read but I needed to rant, I'm sure someone here can relate :(
