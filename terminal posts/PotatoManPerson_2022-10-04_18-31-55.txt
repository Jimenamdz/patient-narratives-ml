Look, I get it. Cancer is awful for everyone involved. But I don't know if your cousin's cancer is terminal and I don't know what their life expectancy is. Literally every case is different. We are all here for a horrible reason, and I don't enjoy all these recent posts asking medical questions that we don't have the knowledge to answer. I'm working on living my life with cancer. Maybe you should make an appointment with a doctor?
