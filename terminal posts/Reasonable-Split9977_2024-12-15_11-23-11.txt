Hey everyone :) 

The last month has been pretty overwhelming. As I finish up another chemotherapy option that also hasn’t worked, my anxiety has been going through the roof. I’ve been losing my mind a little bit as I’m sure a lot of you can relate. 

BUT… my beautiful partner has been working his arse off the past six months to save enough for us to go overseas together AND have another month after of time together without him having to work. After six years of dating we have never had the chance to do something like this but now we do. I’m so excited to escape treatment and have some fun albeit it being a little risky with where I’m at with treatment. I know how lucky I am to have this opportunity but I just wanted to come on here and share because I know this community will understand how special this is to me. I have this gut feeling that this will be our last opportunity to do something like this which is very emotional but wow I’m just so bloody excited!!!!! 

An added bonus is I get to avoid the annoying “you’ll get through this” conversations from relatives when my cancer is terminal. Wins all round. 

Anyway if you read this thanks for letting me share and listening. Idk if I can sleep tonight, can’t wait :) 

**UPDATE

You guys are amazing, thanks so much for the support. We landed last night, checked into our accom and then immediately went to a local sushi place. It was awesome :)
