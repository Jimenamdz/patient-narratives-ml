 ****AUGUST UPDATE**** SCROLL DOWN******
I recently found out I had rectal cancer stage 4  via a pet scan. I have had no symptoms and today I am going to get my biopsy. I have a 2 yr old boy and a wife I love both dearly. I am very big into fitness and eating healthy which is why I'm in such shock when the doctor gave me the news. I don't know what to expect. I never been more scared in my life I keep thinking about my wife and son and it brings me to tears. I am going to fight this to the bitter end. This has been the hardest fee days of my life the first mistake I made was googling (DO NOT DO) and it just raised my feat to max level. I have never cried so much in my life. I feel fine I don't have any symptoms except one and it's recent that it's hard to use tge bathroom. My doctor said that if I have lymphoma which he sees in alot of young adults that its very cureable. I would like to know if this is the same doctors have to others who are in my situation or have some of you guys been able to beat tgis when its the worse case scenario.I would love to hear stories of people being in my situation and beating this dang cancers butt. I am really broken right now and I just need to hear stories of other surviors and people currently in treatment on what to expect. I would also like to know what questions I should be asking my doctor and what treatments I should be asking him about when they come up with my plan. I apologize for my messy Grammer and paragraph I've just been having a hard time. Can anyone relate to my situation?    
****UPDATE BEGINS****

I went to a top cancer center in the country and they gave me the best news you could ask for in this situation . Since I wrote this Reddit Post the next day i finally went to my local oncologist and he pretty much told me essentially he could give me several extra years it was devastating my wife started crying and panicking. I didn't accept that as my fate so I started to talk to people in colontown and doing  research on everything I could know about the top places to get treatment. The 10 following 10 days were the worse 10 days ever no words can describe the fear and hopelessness I felt. 

I just turned 36 a month prior, not growing old with my wife who I have been with since she was 18 and I was 19. I always thought what life would be like when I get old with my wife grayed but still my beautiful wife.How it would be like seeing my son grow and guiding him to manhood. Then seeing my Son grown up and married bringing over my grandkids what that would be like.   Now I was told that wasn't going to happen. 
 
 asked God to guide me and give me wisdom that I make the right call as this is a actual life saving or ending decision.  Stay locally and enjoy the last bit of time I have left (immediately discarded because I'm never give up) Next choice was this place in Arizona which does unique style of treatment and highly thought of and  innovative cancer canter . After a few days of deeply considering it I said no to thst one. (Felt like they sell snake oil).
 Next was the most recommended place in my region recommended to me. I said no to this one as well, just something in me felt uneasy with this place (didnt help my local oncologist did his residency there)  even though they are considered by many as the pinnacle of cancer center treatment and advancement . Couldn't do it. 

Now on to my final choice,the one I said yes to. This cancer center is considered as 1B  to the previous mention hospital. This cancer center for whatever reason made something to the very depths of my soul 
scream, "THESE GUYS WILL SAVE YOU ,DUMMY". Still I was on the fence mostly because it was on the other side of the country the which means leaving  my beloved wife and two year old for several months potentially. This is a fight for my existence I was going to do whatever it takes.
 Then randomly out the blue I had a guy dm me from reddit or the FB groups (don't remember which)  we start talking and we both had similar demographics the same average age, sex  and diagnosis. Immediately after a few moments and he talks about where he got treated and immediately names the exact center I felt so strongly would save me. Starts telling me he went with 2 other guys with the same demographic as us  (sex,age,gender,diagnosis) and that all 3 of them are  little over 3 years NeD. After hearing that my top pick got my 3 new friends NeD bout made me immediately start making arrangements to get treated at this place no matter what. The trip there was a nightmare, I broke my toe. I missed the connecting flight. Airline lost all my luggage so i had nothing other than whats in my back pack. I get to a  hotel at 12 am to  check out at 4 am to go to the airport at 4 pm that same day. I still has to drive to the hotel I booked which was the most reasonably priced and closest to the treatment facility and get booked. Then arrive to my hotel and they....canceled my reservation because I was a day late to to check in. They finally fixed my reservations(took a hour or so to resolve this.  I got to my room and I only had a 40 mins until my appointment with the new oncologist.
  I really felt like something or someone was trying to do everything it could  do to make sure I missed that appointment. I swear I really felt evil forces are stopping me.  I sat in the room for 25mins  before I had to leave and go to my oncology appointment and I sat so hopeless, thinking about not going and felt that that I was just going to hear the same outcome my local oncologist gave me. A death sentence. 
   My appointment was for a 90 mins with the 3 oncologist on my treatment team. I told them how I stumbled upon this diagnosis BTW I dont think I mentioned in the original post that my Uncle dying suddenly at a young age from heart attack put my ass in to gear to get my heart check.  Heart disease is rampant in my family which is why I've been exercising 5-6 days  since i was 20. 

So back to my appointment, I finishing talking so the 1st thing my doctors said to me was that after reviewing my scans and my the entire case he said this, " I reviewed what everything your local oncologist records on your diagnosis, treatment, scans and what would be my  ultimate fate. They fully DISAGREEED! They said with full confidence in their voices that I was going to live and that im not going to die! That i was going to eliminated the cancer  and the chances of reoccurence rates for the plan they laid out for me was less that 6%. That very moment the doubt, fear, misery, apathy I felt since my diagnosis all disappeared. I felt my my life breath back into me and pure determination. For the Doctor tell me what he said with the assurance and that I was going to be cancer free is very rare. Doctors don't deal in absolutes unless they TRULY 100%  confident about your treatment outcome. 
  The doctors said that I could be treated by them from my home state. I would just do telehealth visits and the new cancer team will meditate my treatment plan and my local oncologist will implement my new teams plan and do whatever they need.

 One recommendedation I want to give before I end this is post is that  whatever your diagnosis is get the opinion of a top 5 hospital/oncologist/surgeons. One of the reasons the top 5 cancer centers are the cream of the crop is because their technology is far more advanced, their funding is unrivaled, all the top doctors/surgeons/ radiation Drs want to work there and do work at those places. If you have been given bad news,depressed, or you just feel hopelessn.. don't be I have met many and i mean MSNY people with way worse diagnosis and who have been told they're terminal  some told more than that more than once. Yet they didn't give up found a top cancer center or Doctor that gets them Ned and are still . I want to stress this again, do not play with your life or let your fate be decided by some  mid level doctor or hospital.
