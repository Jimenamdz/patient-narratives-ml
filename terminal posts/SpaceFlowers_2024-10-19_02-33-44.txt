Title: I just need some encouragement right now

I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer a month after my 29th birthday this year. Mets in liver and lungs. My oncologist told me itâ€™s incurable/ terminal/ inoperable. I had a port placed and stared 5-fu in February. 50% tumor reduction after two months. Then I got sepsis from my port incision not closing properly. Took a month off of chemo. Found out my cancer is a genetic mutation (PMS2) and started a clinical trial. 8 cycles later and the tumor in my colon is 95% gone. The liver and lung mets are shrinking or are stable. 

I was really positive in the beginning. Despite all the good news, I find myself spiraling. I canâ€™t get over being terminally ill. I just finished my apprenticeship for my dream job in December of 2023. I got a job in my field in January. I thought I was finally going to be living my life the way I have always dreamed. Now I feel like it has been snatched away from me. I canâ€™t work often because Iâ€™m in bed 90% of the time. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll live long enough to get married or achieve any of my career goals. I know no one can tell me for certain if Iâ€™ll live to see 40 or even 31, but I just need some encouragement from people who are going through this too.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your kind words and advice. Despite our circumstances, this is a beautiful community. I was in a dark place last night and all of your responses have made me feel infinitely better. I will look at this thread every time I start to spiral and know that Iâ€™m not alone. Thank you thank you thank you ðŸ–¤
