Title: I just hate myself so much

Content:
I’m a terminal bc patient. First diagnosed and operated on late 2019, recurrence 9 months later, multi centric ER+ and PR +++, spread to bones in 2021.
I have a PALB2 mutation.
 The more days go by, the more I start really hating myself.
I hate my body for having this mutation in my genes. I hate the way my meds make me look. I hate how people try not to talk about the elephant in the room. I hate myself for not saying what I want of for saying too much of what I want. I can never get it right. I hate myself for constantly losing control over my feelings. 
I hate how every day is a fight and how little I can do about it.
I hate how I’m expecting others to want to spend more time with me because who knows how much I have left.
I hate myself for pushing myself too little but others too much. I feel like a terrible person. 
I feel like it would be better to die sooner so that my children remember less of me and suffer less. I wouldn’t be this nagging burden anymore. I’m sorry, I’m just ranting internally and can’t let it out anymore.
