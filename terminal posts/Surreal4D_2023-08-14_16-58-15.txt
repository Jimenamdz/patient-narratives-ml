My dad 56(M) (ex cigarette smoker, now vapes) just found out two weeks ago he has stage 4 lung cancer. No prior symptoms other than drastic weight loss within a month, losing 30lbs.

The CT scan and MRI show that it’s traveled to his Humorous bone (which he broke this week lifting a toilet lid), liver & Spine (tumor growing compressing his L5 nerve). Tumor in his left lung, pelvis/spine area, and somewhere else i can’t recall at this moment. This all of a sudden happened, rapidly too. He can hardly walk cause the compression of the nerve and hopefully the radiation decompresses that with shrinking the tumor. 


Each time I go visit him he can hardly move and looks worse and worse. It has progressed so fast and I don’t know how much more time he has left. What was once a bright beam of light of a human is now diminishing slowly. 

The oncologist never deemed him terminal but from what I have read most stage 4 is at this point.
