Title: Acceptance. Terminal but sorta not?

I have iodine resistant thyroid cancer and no matter what we do, it keeps growing and coming back. It is unrelenting and I am pretty sure I'm not willing to do any more surgery. I've had two radical neck dissections. I'm still having pain from my last surgery. Had a scan Monday that showed growth in some lymph nodes in my neck. Don't get me wrong, I'm not dying tomorrow, but the writing is on the wall and I damn sure don't have decades. For most folks with iodine resistant cancer it's 5-10y. So I'm not terminal... But yet.. I don't have any promise of a future beyond a few years and I have to start shedding things and preparing my wife for my time to be up. So many things to explain and show her how to operate so she keeps access to email, etc. There's a time for hope, but when that's up it's time to accept and start cleaning house.
