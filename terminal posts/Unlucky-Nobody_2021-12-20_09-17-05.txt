Well it's official had my big scary oncology appointment today. Funnily enough he is a lung cancer specialist and a sarcoma specialist. I will get the best of care but it is most defiantly not curable. It is terminal I probably have 12 months. My goal now is to make it to 40. oddly I am more at peace with it now.

For all those that need support you have my hugs and love, hang in there. But I will probably be off reddit for a while living life while I still feel good.

I start chemo on the 17th. I will Be back to share hugs and support when I start getting sick.
