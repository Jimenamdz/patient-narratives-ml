dont remember if i posted here before but..

I'm 24 (recently turned) my partner is 27. He originally had bone cancer that spread to his lungs after an amputation.. anyway, hes terminal. Has been for a few months now. recently the tumour grew about over 100% of its original size, hes still here, but is struggling with breathing and chest pain, and recently said his lips and fingers are blue, aside from that, no other signs.

One thing is though - we are long distance. us meeting is just not possible due to certain conditions in his country, and it just pains me to know that, one day, he could just stop talking, and i wouldnt know this horrible illness finally took him away from me. This is the first man who has loved me fully and it just feels like some cruel joke that he just had to have cancer.

its been difficult. i wish i could physically help him. i really do, but all i can do is be there. talk to him. hes got chemo in the morning.. i just hope he truly does live these 5 years hes been told he has left.

I just dont know how to cope with that. the fact that one day thats it. that any day could be our last, i cant stop crying and i just wish things were different

im sorry this isnt allowed. i just need to get this out

  
UPDATE: I just wanted to update, i know its been a month but. 

  
He ended up with a collapsed lung, he went in for that and came out. Was fine for a bit.. you know, recovering. 

  
But then, recently he caught a cold. And it progressed to necrotizing pneumonia, hes currently have an emergency surgery as we speak. I'm honestly quite terrified? it sounds pretty bad. ive googled it and theres results saying people can recover from it. but idk. its just insane man
