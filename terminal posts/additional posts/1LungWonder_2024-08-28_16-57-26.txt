Title: No God did not cure my cancer....

I am a cancer survivor and it drives me absolutely crazy when people say things like "God healed you" and Give God the Glory for your cure" (I'm not cured, never will be..) or my favorite "ONLY Jesus can do this! Praise God!"  No, I'm alive because of early diagnosis and SCIENCE.. Science is responsible, and let's not discount my own body for healing after surgery, chemo, and radiation. If God is so great, why did I get diagnosed with cancer when my baby was 3 months old? Why would an all-powerful and loving god do that?? The circles they go in to try and justify is mind boggling.. But I thank my surgeon  and science for my success.. not God.
