I was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma on this day 19 years ago. It was 1:30 in the afternoon. I still remember every detail of that 30-minute appointment, mostly the look of fear on my husband's face, the very sorrowful look on the doctor's, and me thinking this was NOT how I would die... They told me I would only live 15 months without intervention, so I took the most extreme intervention available at the time. I had my entire left lung removed, but ultimately it's what saved my life. 19 years later I'm still here, living well with one lung..
