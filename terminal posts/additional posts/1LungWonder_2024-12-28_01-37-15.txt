We brought this little void in on Christmas Eve assuming it was a girl… We were able to get into the vet today and She is a He!!! So instead of Guinevere, his name is Coal.. as many of you called him the best lump of coal to get on Christmas Eve!!! 
He got his shots, and tested for all the things, still waiting for results on those. And no microchip… we wanted to make sure he didn’t belong to anyone.  He’s still decompressing in the guest room after a busy day. 
For being a stray, he’s incredibly affectionate and calm.. We’re giving him all the time he needs to acclimate and will get him fixed as soon as possible. 
Welcome home to our little lump of Coal…
