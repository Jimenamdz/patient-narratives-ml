Title: Feature request: add search capability to “Saved”

Hi, I have a feature request that I find strange that hasn’t been suggested before (I tried searching). Could you add search capabilities to saved posts? I have years of saved posts and I’m starting to have difficulty finding stuff that I know I saved 2 years ago. 

Thanks for making a great reader!
