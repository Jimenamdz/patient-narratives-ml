Title: I feel pressured to have sex without being pressured

Me and my girlfriend broke up recently and i've been thinking about our relationship and how a lot of the time i actually didn't want to have sex but we'd do it anyway, she never pressured me into it i was usually the one to make the first move. But sometimes id get really scared all of a sudden or id cry after or have a panic attack, but after that we would do it a couple days later even though i knew i felt uncomfortable and it was likely to end badly. 

Growing up I was sexually assaulted multiple times by two close family members and I'm not sure if this is why i feel the pressure to do it even if i'm uncomfortable.

Does anyone else feel like this? or is it just me because of what iâ€™ve gone through?
