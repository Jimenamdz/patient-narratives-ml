Title: Spinal radiotherapy

Yesterday I had my first spinal radiotherapy to reduce my back/chest pain from the cancer cells that were found last week in my spine.

I am in so much pain today, ironically, that I will definitely not be doing it again. The pain is so bad. It's so much worse than the pain I had it to relieve, and although I've been told that this pain is temporary (but not how long for!) it is definitely not worth it. With every passing moment the pain gets worse. 

I felt I had to post just because of the ridiculousness of it. This is so, so much worse than the pain it is supposed to reduce. I cannot believe my oncologist thought this would be worth it, I feel so betrayed.
