2 months since mom passed away.
I am seeing everyone including me getting busy with other life stuff. I feel guilty of doing so, it feels like are we forgetting her?
Sometimes when I see at her pictures, my heart aches the same way as her last time, totally helpless, and complaining to God.

I miss her voice and phone calls. I don't know what is happening!
