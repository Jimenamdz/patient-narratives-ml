I don't want to ramble but I am incredibly overwhelmed by life right now and literally just don't know what to do. (But not at risk of hurting myself)

The only official diagnosis I have is general anxiety and depression. I'm not currently on medication and I would prefer to keep it that way. 
I have been seeing a psychologist but it wasn't going well, she's now away for an undetermined amount of time and apparently no one else is available to see me. I got a sick note for a couple of weeks which has helped relieve the pressure a bit but I just don't know where to go from here. 

Just feels like there isn't enough support. I don't know what to do. And I don't know how to explain things better without writing an essay. There is so much pressure being on my own, I've also had significant physical health issues these last couple of years and it just feels like everything has caught up to me and it's all too much and I can't deal with everything.
