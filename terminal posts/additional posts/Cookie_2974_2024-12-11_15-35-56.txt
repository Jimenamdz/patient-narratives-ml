Title: Capital gains tax query

Sorry if this is relatively simple but I'm getting myself confused with capital gains tax.

I was living with my mum in a house she owned. 
She passed away and I inherited the house and continued to live there for a while.
I then moved into rented accomodation.
I'm now in the process of selling the house.

Will I need to pay capital gains tax? How does it all work? Thanks!
