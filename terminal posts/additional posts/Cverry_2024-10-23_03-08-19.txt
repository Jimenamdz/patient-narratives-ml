In August 2023 I was diagnosed with terminal cancer, DSRCT, and told I have two years to live. Naturally my family came together and asked “What would make you happy? Anything you want it’s yours…”

Without hesitation I said “A black Mustang GT Premium.”

Baffled, they said you don’t want to travel, do things you’ve always dreamed?

Of course I do…I just want to do it in a Mustang.

They made it happen and I can say as a dying man, it’s the only thing that makes me feel ALIVE! 

(Don’t worry, I took of the hideous plastic plate mount on the front)
