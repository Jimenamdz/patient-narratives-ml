Title: Months left..

33, F, Stage IV

After 14 months of treatment, suitable chemo options (Folfoxiri, Folfox, 5FU, Folfiri) are no longer working. The cancer is aggressively spreading despite treatment. My organs are not faring well and I have been hospitalised twice for neutropenia. Oncologist and Palliative doc are supporting no further treatment and to seek comfort measures.

I have been told I have months left and to try and do any of my last wishes or bucket list items as soon as possible and get my affairs in order.

Anyone else in the same boat? I don’t even know how I feel. A huge weight is off my shoulder no longer having to revolve my life around treatment and recovery but of course, it’s difficult to accept.

My outlook overall is positive and I don’t fear death but I’m curious about how things will play out for me. I worry about my family knowing when my pain ends, theirs will begin.

Would love to hear from others facing the same. 

I am sorry if this post is triggering or upsetting to anyone here.

(Please note, I’m not looking for solutions or to be told to seek a second opinion. I have an incredible team of doctors at a very progressive world leading cancer treatment centre)
