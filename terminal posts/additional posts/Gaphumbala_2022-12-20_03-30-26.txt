Title: Trouble swallowing sometimes

I have stage four esophageal cancer and the tumour blocks most of my esophagus.  If I swallow a bit too much food at once, it gets jammed  and won't go any further, for sometimes up to four hours.  In the meantime, I am in pain and salivating excessively.  I am just wondering if anyone has found a method of overcoming the blockage.  Vomiting does not help, nor does trying to swallow some liquid.
