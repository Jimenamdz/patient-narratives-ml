I have not done a cancer update for quite awhile now, but I feel the time has come for another one. About a year ago I underwent a second round of radiation to try to slow the growth of the cancer, which was starting to  resist the immunotherapy treatment that I was on.  It did not help. Last winter I went back on chemotherapy in hopes that it would slow the cancer.  After four months of that, it was still growing. So, as a last ditch attempt to get ahead of the growth, I was offered this other chemo treatment that only has a 30 - 40% chance of helping at all.  It came with hair loss, bleeding and generally feeling like shyte for another three months, in hopes of it giving me another three months.  I have declined this treatment.  I am still able to swallow most foods.  I realize that this is my last summer and I want to make the most of it.  So, in leu of the treatment, the oncologist is referring me to a surgeon to have a stint inserted in my esophagus at some point, to allow food to pass the tumour.  It will be a bit of a life changer, as I will not be able to lie flat or tie my own shoes, otherwise everything in my stomach will make a sudden and unwelcome appearance.  But it should help me retain some quality of life for awhile. So, here is hoping that I will make it to Christmas at least.
I apologize if this a bit “TMI” but I wanted you to know what is happening.

Please remember to stop to enjoy the journey, you don’t know when it will come to an end.
