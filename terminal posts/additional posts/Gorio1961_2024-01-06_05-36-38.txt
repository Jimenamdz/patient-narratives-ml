As stated, I am using an MB trickle charger to keep my E550 battery tendered this winter.  It is a straightforward case of plugging it in and letting it do its thing.  Anyone here use one of these before and willing to share experiences?  I am curious how long it takes for a complete charge and how do I know it's done.  The manual the MB provided was very sparse on operating data.
