Title: W212 Mercedes E550 Rim update

I had several areas on these rims that had damage from potholes and scratches from curbs. Here in LA county, just north of Los Angeles. We have a local shop called Bent Repair. 

I paid them a visit, originally just going to have the chunks repaired, and the scratches smooth over, but the shop owner had a better idea.

He stripped the OEM circa 2014 finish and powder coated the rims in a gloss black finish leaving brushed aluminum highlights and a clearcoat. Before I commissioned this work I paid a visit to the local Mercedes dealer and saw on the showroom floor the 2024 version of OEM rims.

I am over the moon happy with the final results, and I figured I would share them here. So for the price of one rim, I was able to get all four rims refurbished, and they look brand new.

Iâ€™ve also posted before, and after images of the rims.
