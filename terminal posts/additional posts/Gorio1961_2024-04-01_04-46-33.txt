In February, I attended an LA / Orange County Audio Society Annual meeting which was held on the Audeze campus in Orange County. Audeze was offering 50% off ANY of their product lines to those in attendance.

VIOLA! LCD-5s were picked up at an out-the-door price of $2,435.63 ... one drawback, I was now in the cue for a pair when they rolled off the production line.

Yesterday, they arrived. They were well-packaged in an aluminum shipping case complete with high-end cables and a pair of white gloves.

I have been listening to these cans all weekend. My in-studio headphone amp is a Cayin HA-3A (with rolled tubes) paired with a CA DacMagic 200M and my mobile solution is a Fiio M11 LTD Plus. The sound stage in both applications is simply amazing. Lightweight compared to my LCD-XCs.

I am so happy (if not blessed) to have gotten the deal on the flagship headphones.
