Here is my salary progression to add a different perspective to the posts. Part-time jobs during junior/senior high school (began working at 13).  Enlisted in the USAF in 1981.  Served thirty years and retired in 2011 (pulling $74K annually (pension) from that USAF gig).  I began my second career as a DoD Civilian employee in 2012, where I still work.
