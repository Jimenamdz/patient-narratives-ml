Just checking.  I hit my 63rd birthday this weekend as I rush toward my four-year cancerversary in August.  Still undergoing surveillance via bloodwork and CAT scans annually.  Brain fog is diminished, and the short-term memory loss has been manageable.  Nuropathy (both feet/hands) persists, but has platued and I am being told it won't get better or worse...I can accept that.  Dry eyes still bother me, but I am alive and kicking!

This group was so beneficial too me, I felt compelled to provide an update.
