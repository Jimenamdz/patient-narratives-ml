Military veterans might find the paid version beneficial for reviewing electronic medical records in the early stages of VA compensation claim development.  My previously documented claims served as "truth data" when I compared them to ChatGPT findings...pretty damned accurate and fast too.  I upload treatment records spanning a thirty-year USAF career.
