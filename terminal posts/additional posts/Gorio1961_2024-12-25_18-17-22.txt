Title: The value of VA Disability Compensation over time (using average historical increases),..my experience.

Content:
To add a note of explanation, my initial rating in 2012 was 70%; in 2019, it increased to 90%, and in 2023, I was rated 100% P&T. The projected amounts are based on historical increases (COLA); if I live to 80, these amounts will total over $1.3M.

So why post this? Someone waiting to claim or procrastinating on filing a claim can learn from my path.
