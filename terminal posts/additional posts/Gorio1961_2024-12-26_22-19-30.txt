Title: Chat history versus Model Context Set

Content:
When ChatGPT came back to life, my chat history was gone. I asked what had happened and was informed that chat history is still available but contained in the Model Context Set. I asked ChatGPT to display the current Model Context Set; it read familiar but didn't include my entire chat history. Interesting.
