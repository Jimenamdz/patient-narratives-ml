Title: Toll Road Veteran Discount Offerings (so confusing)

Content:
It would be nice and save a lot of confusion if all FasTrak participating California organizations recognized veterans similarly. BayAreaFasTrak, Riverside County Transportation Commission, and SanDag inject confusion by not recognizing Veteran discounts on ALL roads within their authority. MetroExpress doesn't recognize veterans at all.
