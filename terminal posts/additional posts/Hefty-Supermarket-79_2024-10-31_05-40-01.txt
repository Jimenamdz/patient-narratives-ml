We rescued our girl from a nasty shelter, just 2 hrs before her time was up. Such a sweet girl. They told us that she is between 1 and 5 years old...yeah. In other words, they just saw a dog that wasn't a puppy, and not elderly, and through a huge range in and called it a day. (She acts like a very young dog, has super clean teeth and ears, she also walks like our other larger dogs did as older puppies, till around 18 months...I'm guessing 1...)

We've had our guesses. Mine were a mix of Great Pyrenees and white shepherd. My 7 yr old guessed Husky. Others said lab and golden retriever...

See the images for the results! Any guesses on how big she will get? She's currently 65 lbs.
