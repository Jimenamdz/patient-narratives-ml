I saw a new rheum today, and she was wonderful. She listened, validated, didn't rush, and was especially validating despite me not 'looking that bad', like past drs have done.

No. She took the time to truly look at me, and despite the fact that I do not have bright red all over face rash action right now, she acknowledged the milder malar rash going on  rosacea, along with swollen joints, even noticed my swollen shoulders!

Anyway, she noticed that my nasal labial folds are quite deep, and said it's related to the inflammation and malar rash (I didn't realize I had a current malar rash, as the redness is so mild). I've been wondering about this, as I just don't feel like I look like myself, but had assumed it was age (52) and weight (Due to all of my health woes, my body won't let go of an extra 25lbs), related. 

So, has anyone been told this? About deepening nasal labial folds and malar rashes or autoimmune issues affecting them.

She said that I've got a combo of malar and autoimmune rashes as well as rosacea. Super fun.

Curious about other's experiences with these skin issues.
