First: yes I trimmed most of the brown, dried out edges off, I was told by a few people to do this. Please don't come at me, be gentle. I'm learning 🤎👍💚

I know that these babies weren't being watered enough, as I had them in an area of my house that went from having us in it daily, to just randomly, so they didn't get enough care.

I moved them to a corner in the dining room, lots of sun through the curtains, but it doesn't get hot, just nice in the temp, at least for me 😁

They're doing better, but not great. (Same for the little indoor palm guy) What all can help? I think they need more soil, it's looking low. 

I ordered the food from Jack's. I currently have on hand a bottle of liquid B-1 and also Miracle Gro Shake n Feed Palm Plant Food.

Give this novice who is trying to learn some tips! Pretty please 💚
