I need help on how to help my daughter. 

My daughter is 7 and has ADHD and pretty severe anxiety. It took me until she was 5 before I realized that anxiety was causing her to be afraid of people, not simply being shy...it was holding her back from experiences that she wanted to do, but was terrified once we got there. 

She is doing better with a combination of horse therapy, dance and acro (especially for the ADHD wiggles), and medication. None on their own did the trick, but together, it really helps.

However, she has extreme, angry, meltdown reactions when people she doesn't know need to know her info. Examples:

Picking up her prescription, they need to know her name and birthday.

Checking in for an appointment for her. They need that info.

She hears me calling to check on literally anything for her...

This weekend, we had someone from the electric company come do am evaluation on our home to reduce the cost. They needed all of our names to qualify. 

Every single time, full meltdown, saying they don't need to know her info.

She reacts the same if we go to the dr. We literally can't get her a physical. She's just terrified and full freak out happens.

Even when she's even keeled and doing well, this happens. I try and speak to her when she's not triggered, but no luck. 

We are trying to find therapy for her, we've been trying for 3 yrs, and I have called at least 30 places. They either don't take our insurance, she's too young or too old, they're not taking on new patients...one had availability, but virtual only, and it was traditional talk therapy. No way was she going to do that.

Anyone else with a kid with anxiety over people knowing their info? Any tips?
