I posted this not long ago:

And now, I've got more random, painful bumps. About 2 months ago (details in link above), I grew this massive, painful and red bump on the end of my nose. It was too early to be dressing up as Rudolph. A month before that, I had a smaller version in the same spot.

I learned that it's not cystic acne, but something in relation to lupus flares and even part of the whole malar rash issue.

Now, I've got a new one on the side of my nose, and it hurts so much. But, I'm also getting them randomly on my neck, and behind my ears. They look and feel like cystic acne, but don't respond to tretinoin at all. So, I'm wondering if the neck bumps are related to my lupus flare? And any ideas on healing them? (I'm working on reducing over all symptoms, and waiting for the follup up with the new rheum.)
