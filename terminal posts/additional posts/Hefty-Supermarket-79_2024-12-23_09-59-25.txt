Title: Tallow products for hair and skin?

Those who have used tallow products for hair...did it take awhile for your hair to seem normal? I have read so many amazing stories of how great it is for hair and skin, how it slows or stops hair loss or related issues, the hair is now amazing, etc...

3 washes in (over 10 days), my hair is kind of sticky, or tacky. Tangling more. I have tried letting it dry naturally, and blow dry.

I have the shampoo bar, conditioner bar, and apple cider vinegar rinse. I've tried it twice with all three products, and once without the conditioner bar. I rinse thoroughly. 

Tips? Experiences? 

And if you use it and color your hair...tips? I'm getting my hair done tomorrow. 

Sorry for the bad pics üòÅ
