About 18 months ago, I was diagnosed with both lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. I was told we caught it in the early stages...I was prescribed hydroxychloroquine and told take vit D and avoid the sun.

That was it. So I've been reading about having both and everything that I've read says that they have completely different treatments, and that hydroxychloroquine doesn't help RA.

I'm finally seeing my new rheum tomorrow, to go over my labs, so I want to be ready with questions. 

My labs went from very positive for lupus to only showing positive for rheumatoid arthritis. I've been told that hydroxychloroquine can make your labs look good if it's working.

But...I've got on going hair loss, joint pain and fatigue, mild malar rash...

Those who have both lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, tell me everything!

EDIT: starting 2.5mg of methotrexate tomorrow, with a side of folic acid. I'm concerned about stomach issues, since I have SIBO, MCAS, gastroparesis,  and have worked to get them decently under control...
