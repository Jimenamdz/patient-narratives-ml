Ok, saw my wonderful new rheum the lab and imaging follow-up. She's so patient, kind, full of info, well informed, and best of all, validating!

I had never heard the term rhupus before today, although I knew I had both lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. I'm all about finding little sparks of fun or amusement in this brutal journey. Rhupus is fun to say.

I'm about to start on a low dose of oral methotrexate, 2.5mg to start. It's supposed to help my insane level of inflammation. But, she said it can cause additional hair loss ðŸ˜¢...but is prescribing folic acid to combat that. 

I'm really concerned about side effects. I've worked so hard to get my EDS-SIBO-MCAS gut to moderately behave, finally. I'm worried that the methotrexate will wreak it. Thoughts?

I'm also concerned about possibly being down for the count one day or so, every week, because of it. I have a 7 year old. I'm trying to get back to working. And my husband, who is a good person and husband, just doesn't get how bad my health is, so I'm stressed about it affecting us more...
