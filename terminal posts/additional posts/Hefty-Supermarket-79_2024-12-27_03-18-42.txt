I was diagnosed with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis early-ish 2023. But, I truly wonder if I had been tested a few years earlier, if it was there (due to on-going symptoms).


I am on hydroxychloroquine, 400mg, for about 15 months. It helped a lot, forbthe first 6 to 8 months.

Besides extreme fatigue, my most obvious symptoms are very inflamed, puffy fingers that are often weak and feel heavy. And malar rash and annoying, painful, corpuscles (that's what my rheum thinks they are). My hands will get pins and needles as well, but less often. And my face is puffy, especially cheeks and nasal labial folds. And hair loss. Oh, the hair loss.

I've tried various compression gloves. Every single style, brand, and size caused numbness in my finger tips.

I just took my very first dose of methotrexate. Nervous as hell about the possible side effects. I'm to take 5 pills, but I am that person that gets side effects to 99% of every medication I take. So, I took 2, to see how I do. She also prescribed folic acid.

Any tips: for my hands issue? Tips for controlling methotrexate side effects? 

Curious if the methotrexate will help reduce face puffiness. I'm not on prednisone, so I do believe it is about 75% autoimmune caused, 25% weight that I can't seem to lose. (I am hoping that reducing over all inflammation will help that as well...)
