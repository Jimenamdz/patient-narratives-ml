Title: Weird water-pot issue?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1htwhhh

I've got this girl, she's perked up a lot in the last 2 months. I moved her from an area that got mediocre light and wasn't getting enough attention...she's got new baby sprouts, stopped getting brown tips.I do believe she still needs improvement, but maybe I need to be patient. 

But! There's a weird issue. I'm using a cookie sheet to catch any water that comes out the bottom when watering, just like I do with other plants. Something is weird here:
1. Water pooling in the cookie sheet.
2. The plant seems to need watering more often than her sister in another pot just a foot away, the soil feels dry way more frequently. (Similar size plant and pot, the other pot is a bit smaller, but not much)
3. I noticed that the pot is actually damp toward the bottom. 

I'm wondering if this is due to the texture of the pot, maybe not fitting for this type of plant? Although, the other monstera is also in a plastic pot.

So, help me sort out the weird pot-tray-water pooling issue...and if I should transfer it to a new pot: what material is best? Should I add any other substrate to the general potting soil?
