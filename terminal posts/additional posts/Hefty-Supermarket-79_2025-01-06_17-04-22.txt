I've got a question that's...ugg.

I've taken 2 doses of methotrexate.

 My second dose was Thursday. The last 2 days, I'm having bladder leakage out of nowhere. 

And in the last 12 hrs, it's increased. Like, bad. Yes, it was happening in my sleep. It is awful! I had to sleep on a towel. 

The only change in my life is the methotrexate and folic acid. Before calling the rheum, I wanted to see if anyone else has had this problem.
