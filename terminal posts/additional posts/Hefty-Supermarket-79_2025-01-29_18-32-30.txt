Title: Rheum is switching me to rinvoq

If you look up my posts, you may find my woes with methotrexate. 4 weeks of hell. (Tried both pills and injection form. )

Anyway, my rheum doesn't want to give me the usual biologics because they can trigger a lupus response and since my lupus is behaving well on hydroxychloroquine, she doesn't want to chance it.

She is prescribing rinvoq. She is actually on it herself, for RA. She said her patients that are on it do really well. And it's the option that my insurance easily approves.

Anyone on it? Any tips for having a good experience with it?

I just want this damn inflammation to go down!!!
