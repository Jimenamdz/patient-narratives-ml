Title: Low stress jobs for someone with terminal cancer?

My doc says I have about 1-2 years left but I'm hoping I surprise everyone and  live longer than that.

Ideally, I'd just spend the time doing whatever the hell I want, but being terminally ill doesn't mean everything becomes free. And EIA only gives me barely enough to scrape by (though with rising gas and food prices it's not really enough anymore).

So unless some millionaire philanthropist is feeling generous, and since I won't be going through with anymore surgeries or treatment for a while, I was considering going back to work somewhere.

Only problem is all my experience is with kitchens and my body couldn't handle that anymore. Also I have no idea how long I'd be able to work there, so I'd have to be pretty expendable.

Anyone have any suggestions?
