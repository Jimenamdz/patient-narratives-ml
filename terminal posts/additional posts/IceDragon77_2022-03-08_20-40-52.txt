Title: Should I see a massage therapist?

For the last few weeks my right leg has had a pretty constant pain between my knee and my butt. If I twist my leg a certain way I get a really sharp pain up near where my leg connects to my pelvic area. I've been walking with a limp ever since.

I had an x-ray and it came back clean.

Is this the appropriate time to see a massage therapist? I've never had a massage before.
