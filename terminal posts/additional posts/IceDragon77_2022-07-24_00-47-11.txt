For the last year I've been tinkering with this deck idea. I just want to play tokens. Lots of tokens. ALL of the tokens! But I don't want to sit there with a wall of them gumming up the board state and slowing things down. I want to USE the tokens to do stuff. Then I had the most sudden epiphany! 

The TOTALLY METAL LOOKING avatar token that [[Awaken the Blood Avatar]] creates is NOT. EVEN. LEGENDARY!


So I present to you [Awaken the MFing Blood Avatar!](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/APa3Mx35TEC2xcDorfnEMQ)


This deck is all about making tokens, sacrificing them to cast our commander sorcery and getting maximum value while doing so! Annoy the living hell out of your opponents by making them repeatedly sacrificing their creatures! Get rewarded for casting instants and sorceries! TURN AVATARS SIDEWAYS AND BLEED THE TABLE DRY! Get so much value they'll be wondering if they should name a new deadly sin after you!


Make Tokens! ALL THE TOKENS! [[Bitterblossom]], [[Assemble the Legion]], [[Sedgemoor Witch]], [[Tvesh Szat, Doom of Fools]], [[Visions of Glory]], [[Grand Crescendo]], [[Release the Dogs]], [[Field of the Dead]], etc etc!

Draw cards! LOTS OF CARDS! [[Skullclamp]], [[Bennie Bracks, Zoologist]], [[Plumb the Forbidden]], [[Village Rites]], [[Idol of Oblivion]] etc etc!

Make treasure! [[Mahadi, Emporium Master]], [[Pitiless Plunderer]], [[Prosperous Partnership]]

Drain the table! [[Zulaport Cutthroat]], [[Bastion of Rememberance]], [[Nadier's Nightblade]], etc etc!

GET! MORE! VALUE! [[Anointed Procession]], [[Double Vision]], [[Teysa Karlov]], [[Chandra, Acolyte of Flame]], [[Kaya, Geist Hunter]] ETCETERA! ETCETERA!

Interaction!? OF COURSE WE HAVE THAT! [[Wear//Tear]], [[Fracture]], [[Despark]], [[Heliod's Intervention]], [[Austere Command]] AND MORE!


Awaken SO MANY Avatars, you'll get sued by Nickelodeon for copyright infringement! 


*"But IceDragon, that's not a lot of creature removal"*

OUR COMMANDER **IS** CREATURE REMOVAL!

*"But IceDragon, how do you build a token deck without green and [[Doubling Season]]?"*

I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF THIS SWEET AIR GUITAR! TWEEDLY TWEEDLY TWEE!!

Don't trust me? Then just listen to these totally legit TESTIMONIALS!

*"Wait, how much damage am I taking?"* - Curtis

*"Those aren't legendary?"* - Tom

*"Disgusting*" - Linda

*"Ugh"* - Allen

So in conclusion: WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? GO BUILD THIS DECK!
