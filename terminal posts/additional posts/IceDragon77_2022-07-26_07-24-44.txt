I've been itching to play one lately. I've already played the hell out of State of Decay 1+2. Any games out there like it?

I tried DayZ but I found that game was way too much of a chore and sucked all the fun out of surviving.

I just want to kill zombies and loot buildings for gear. With an emphasis on surviving. I love Dying Light, but that's not a survival game.
