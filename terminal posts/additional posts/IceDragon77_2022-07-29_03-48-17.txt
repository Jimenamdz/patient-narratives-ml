Title: Since this is one of my favorite games of all time, I had a question for the devs.

I've been following this game since the first time it was posted on reddit. The more I saw, the more I fell in love with it, and then it released and absolutely lived up to all of my hype. Then you released a free DLC which just added to the amazingness.

The DLC also heavily hinted at a sequel, which is where my question/request comes in.

So my back story is I'm a 31 year old guy, who loves video games, but unfortunately I have terminal cancer. I was diagnosed when I was 27 and fought it with surgeries, chemo, radiation, the whole works. In February they told me I have about a year or two left.

After weeks and weeks of trying to wrap my brain around the thought of dying before I really got to do the things in life that most people want, I managed to stop panicking, calm down, and I started to think about how I want my last years to go by, and how I want people to remember me.

So I was wondering, if you do make more Monster Sanctuary, could you add me to the game as an NPC, or maybe as a keeper you can fight and if you beat me I give the players an egg that they can't get anywhere else?

I don't know how long it'll be before we see more Monster Sanctuary, but I have a lot of friends that I've convinced to play this game and they've fallen in love with it too. So it'd be really cool if they could see me in the game after I'm gone. 

Anyways, even if the answer is no, thanks for reading my story. And guys, get your butts checked by a doctor. You are never too young to be sure. Don't end up like me.
