I want my character to look like Hank Hill but wearing monk robes and holding a musket. Ideally the robes would be coloured to match the character; blue pants, white top, brown boots.

Our campaign is pretty silly. One person's character looks like Dr. Doom. So please, make this the most badass Hank Hill you can. Take whatever liberties you want as long as the face is easily recognizable. Have fun with it!
