I'm going to be starting chemo soon so I was already planning to shave my head, and I figure why not be my favorite bald character? 

Only problem is my legs are pretty bad right now due to the cancer, so driving around and shopping in person is not possible for me. So I was wondering if anyone had spotted anything so I could send a friend to go pick it up for me.
