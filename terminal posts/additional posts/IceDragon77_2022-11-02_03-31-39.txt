Title: Looking for drinks that are high in calories but low in sugar.

So I'm in this weird spot where I'm diabetic so I want to avoid sugary drinks, but my cancer is causing me to lose a lot of weight because of my lack of appetite so I was also told to avoid zero calorie drinks which is mostly what I've been drinking.

I make myself smoothies that are both high in calories but low in sugar, but I can't drink them 24/7. Sometimes I just want to open the fridge and pull out a drink that I can have immediately without cleaning a blender. I thought of milk, but after more than two cups milk starts to make me not feel great, so I only see it as a partial solution. 

Anyone have any drinks that are low in sugar but still pack some calories?
