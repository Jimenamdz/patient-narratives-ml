Title: When they add Home support to S/V, do you think they will update so we can transfer Hisuian mons into the game?

I mean, a lot of the regular versions of the Hisuian mons are already in the game. Plus thematically it could make sense! They're basically foreign paradox pokemon when you think about it.

It'd be fun to get to bring all the pokemon I caught over the last year and see their true battling potential.
