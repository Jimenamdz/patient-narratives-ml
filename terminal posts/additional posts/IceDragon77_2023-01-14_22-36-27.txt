It's probably my favorite reoccurring fast food limited time item.

What I love to do is get the bacon portabella baked potato as a side but swap out the potato for fries, which gives you delicious bacon, mushroom, cheese fries! I have no idea why it's not already on the menu and you have to ask them to do it, since it seems like such a simple swap.

The Wendy's we went to actually said they "couldn't do it" but in the end they gave us all the toppings so we could assemble it ourselves and we actually ended up with more food than if they just made the swap themselves!
