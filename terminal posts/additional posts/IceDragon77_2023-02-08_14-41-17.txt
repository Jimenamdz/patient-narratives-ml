I know, kinda all over the place. But after spending hundreds of hours on Slay the Spire and Monster Train, I am ready to try something new.

I love playing games with interesting battle mechanics and have been obsessed with cards/dice games since I was a kid. 

 So what kind of recommendations do you guys have?

Edit: So many awesome recommendations so far, thanks guys! I love how many of these I've never heard of before.
