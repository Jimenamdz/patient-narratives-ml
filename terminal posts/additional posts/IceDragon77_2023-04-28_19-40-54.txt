Figure if I'm dying I might as well give y'all a chance to meet me if you want. Just ask for Justin. Sorry if this post isnt allowed by the mods. I also was wondering if I could have on of those cool title things. The Prophet was cool but maybe something more awesome? 

Anyways thanks for everything you guys. I've never felt so loved by a community. I'll keep cheering on the Jets no matter what. I love you guys!! Pour one out for me at portage and main when the boys do win the cup.

Oh and don't forget to get your asses checked by a doctor! I was only 27 when I was diagnosed, so don't act like you're too young.

Anyways I'm tired now, I'll see ya around!
Love, your friendly neighborhood ice dragon.
