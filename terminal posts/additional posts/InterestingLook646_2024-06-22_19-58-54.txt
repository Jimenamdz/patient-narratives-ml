Title: Exon 20 Treatments 
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/lungcancer/comments/1dm43j7/exon_20_treatments/

I have stage four NSCLC with mets to the brain. I have the EGFR mutation. Mine is exon 20 and if you're familiar you know that most immunotherapy and targeted therapies do not work. I have been on Rybrevant since December and it's worked well until now. They found it has spread further in my lungs. If you or a family member have the exon 20 mutation and know of another treatment specific for exon 20 please let me know.  Yes I already know of the exon 20 group, I am reaching out to them as well.
