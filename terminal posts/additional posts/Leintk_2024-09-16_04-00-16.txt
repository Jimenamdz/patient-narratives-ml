I've been picking up multi ranked opposed to warzone ranked lately and I'm wondering what's the skill gap like for sub vs. ar? I've been using an AR almost exclusively my entire first season of ranked and I'm having loads of success, but I've been kind of mind controlled by that in a way to believe I should pick up a sub. In my mind I'm like okay I frag like crazy with an AR, I should run a sub and frag even harder, but usually that's not the case.



Like yeah their different playstyles but it's not like I'm foreign to using a sub because that's 90% of what I'm killing with in WZ. Is the style really that different? Any insights on how the roles play differently would be appreciated.

  
Lastly I'm curious in regards to ranking/what I can expect. This is my first season playing any ranked in COD and I'm currently crim 1 in resurgence and rank 16 plat 2 in multi. But I soloq only and don't use my mic... I believe I can eventually get to diamond playing the same way I am now but I'm imagining crim+ is probably a lot sweatier and I actually need to party up and comm? The reason I'm not comming rn is because I simply don't know any of the call outs so I won't even be of help. But how do I learn the callouts?
