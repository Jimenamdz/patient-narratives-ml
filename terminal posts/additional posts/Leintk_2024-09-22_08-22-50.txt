Hitting 1300 feels quite odd because I'm pretty sure maybe I'm just on a hot streak and hitting a peak but at the same time I don't know if that's the case either because this is sort of how I felt after hitting 1200. I got stuck around the 1050-1099 range for probably a month and then I finally broke into the 1100's and I still felt quite stuck for a very long time around another month. But I remember when I was in the 1100's I would face 1200's and get crushed, but then one day I randomly peaked into 1200 and haven't dropped out since and all the 1100's that were roughly equal to me last month feel like easier wins now.

Now 1200's have taken the place of 1100's being roughly equal. But the thing is is I feel like I haven't even changed really much in my game and in fact I think I might actually be worse at solving puzzles than I was 1050 elo before because my puzzle rating is only 1900 but it used to be 2100 and I feel like I have actually got worse at puzzles.

Chess feels like a really hard game to track progress in, like sure you may see your elo raise but I don't actually feel like a different player or anything? When I was 1050 elo if I faced a 1300 I would just know I was cooked, but now as the 1300 player, thinking of facing my old self I wouldn't really feel like I have any edge? IDK MAN IM IN MY HEAD. Obviously I've improved, like overall I'm making less blunders and more consistently decent moves, but it just feels so weird to see progress but not actually be confident in my skills matching that progress.

I'm really curious if anyone else feels the same way about this
