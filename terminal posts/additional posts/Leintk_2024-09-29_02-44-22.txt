Title: I'm kind of at a loss at how to improve pass 1300 elo

When I first started playing chess I was 300 elo, now I'm 1300 elo 6 months later, the progress I've made can be contributed to the chess habit series by GM Aman. It worked really well teaching me the fundamentals of chess and making generally acceptable moves, even if they aren't the best move.

  
Now I feel like I'm at a point where petty much all my games are decided by whoever blunders a tactic first. I am doing puzzles, but apart from sharpening my board vision, how do I improve? I don't know what to study, I don't feel like I'm gaining the same value out of the chess habit series as I did previously. Is there any YT series, course, or potentially even a book I can read that can get me to the 1500+ elo range?
