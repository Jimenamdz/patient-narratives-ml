I used to be a lot better at PvM many years back but I took a break after being burnt out from my main and fast forward till now I have a 2k total Iron that's in the end game I'm getting back into raiding as my main form of content/progression. Right now I'm spending most of my time on the game mastering solo cox, I got 3:0 down and 4:1 I'm like 80% good on, still have room for improvement for sure but I'm now confident getting back into cycle and maintaining 4:1 for the whole HP bar. I'm flame skipping, but I still need to learn to acid walk etc.

Anyways, I'm curious to the zuk helmers how long did it take you guy's to get insanely good and do you have any advice on how to get there? I find it really fascinating how impressive some of your povs are it's like you guy's have 100% mouse accuracy and tick perfect all the time. Surely it must be auto pilot after 1000's of hours of doing the same mechanics or what?

I try to find comparison in another game like league of legends. In that game I'm masters which requires pretty good mechanics to achieve involving mouse accuracy, and I feel like it has transfered over to runescape to a decent degree, but I'm really lacking in knowledge and experience. There's also a lot of timing involved with being good in PvM I feel like. Anyways yeah, just looking to create some discussion about high level PvM and if anyone would be down to share their journey getting to their skill level.
