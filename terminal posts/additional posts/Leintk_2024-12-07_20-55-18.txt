Title: Are all who are Elected/Predestined guaranteed to be saved?

We know we are chosen by God, so I'm wondering is it possible that God chooses someone to be of the elect, but for whatever reason they never become saved because for example, they never heard the gospel?

For example, see 2 Timothy 2:10 "Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory."

Paul is saying he's okay enduring being persecuted in prison so that he can still help share the gospel to the elect so they may obtain salvation. Does this mean someone may be of the elect but if they never are preached to they may die unsaved? It's biblical God chooses us, but we have to choose him also.

Romans 10:9-10 "If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved."

So basically is it possible there are people who are of the elect in say India, or China, Korea etc. that are chosen by God, but since they are raised in non-Christian areas, they may go their entire life without hearing the Gospel and die unsaved?

One last question, does this also mean that there is a fixed amount of us elected in the history of life? I could be wrong but I remember hearing that all who are meant to be saved must be saved before something big happens like Christ coming back or something like that idk. It may be somewhere in revelation but I can't find it. Does anyone know what I'm referring to?
