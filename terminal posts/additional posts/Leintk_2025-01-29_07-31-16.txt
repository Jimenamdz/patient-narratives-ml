I play the vienna as white and have a 66%wr on it, but as black I have a recent winrate of 20-30% in the last 20 games as black. I feel like I've tried so many openings as black and I can't really find one that I like a lot. I find it much easier to play against 1. e4, than 1. d4. Against d4 I've tried the dutch, the pirc/kings indian, QGD, Anti london setup, the modern, etc. I think I like the dutch the most against d4 as it feels like it gives me more of a volatile game as black and sort of forces them to play my game which I like. In theory my dream would be to learn and get good at the caro against e4, then learn the dutch to a greater degree, but I'm still wondering if there's something better out there for me. Black just feels so much worse to play than white. I like to attack fast and I'm decent at attacking for my level which is why my wr is so high on the vienna, but I can't seem to get that same playstyle playing as black...
