Today i turned 33. Not only am I 33, but it is also my 3rd birthday alive living with stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer.  3 years ago, i was in the middle of chemotherapy and looking back I still can't believe I'm alive. I mean...stage 4...and i was in so much pain but...I'm here :) 

Just wanted to share my birthday here and to also maybe cheer some people up. 

I love you <3
