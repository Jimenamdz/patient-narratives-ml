STORY EPISODE ONE THE FRITO MENACE 


So, during the start of my chemo treatment, my sister was, and still does, helping take care of me since we lived together.  She had the idea to...well, gimmie some mary jane ðŸ˜… and me being the lame and boring person i am have never really have smoked before save a few times. 

So, i take too big of a hit when i had gotten home from a chemo session.  I'd like to note that my treatment was the one where i did 6 hrs in the infusion bay and then would go home with the portable pump for another and then come back the 3rd day for removal and a white blood cell booster,

Anywhos.....

I get home, i end up taking way too big of a hit and cough my guts out. I calm down after awhile and my sister helps carry me to bed. I rest for a bit and then i walk out to the living room on cloud 9 asking "SISTER WHERE ARE THE FRIIIITOOOOOOOOOOOOOS" to which she responds "i think we're out sorry dude" and me being out of mind get ultra sad and at the top of my lungs bellow out "nooooooooooooo my fritoooooooooooooooos. I love my fritooooooooooooooooooos" 

My sister is dying laughing and I'm sad we're put of fritos cause i love fritos, especially when we make walking tacos ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ and for pretty much the rest of the night, I'm just talking about how much i miss my fritos ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… 

Once i finally came down and was fully aware, my sister told me all about my obsession and how sad i was about fritos to which i goto the store and a big box of 50 little bags of fritos. 



The end.
