Today, exactly 2 years ago at my final treatment of chemo, my oncologist announced to me that I was in complete remission. 

Stage 4 Pancreatic And Liver cancer. 

2 years. 2 whole flipping years. 

I'm being maintained with chemo pills that I will have to take for the rest of my life however that may be since...well...my oncologist has never given me a expiration date. In her words "you could walk outside get hit by a car and die. Idk if and when you will pass, but you need to live your life to your fullest" 

And even tho I have my paranoia... I'm grateful to know I could live a long and somewhat comfortable life. I am 33 now and all this happened right before I turned 31 in 2022. I'll never forget that pain that made me finally goto the ER. 

My oncologist did clarify me as fully disabled and could no longer work due to the face I'll be stage 4 for the rest of my life and that there is always the possibility of it returning, but until then..I am ordered to live. 

My mom has been encouraging me to maybe contact the Cancer Society and be a motivational speaker so that I can hopefully help others who are scared and alone, because not everyone gets to have a support team and that is truly unacceptable. I'm just..scared of being told "No" 

But anyway, in the great words of Joshua Graham "the fire inside me burned Brighter than the fire around me and it was their love" "In the end, there is always light in the darkness" 
If you ever came across a Joshua Graham quote video and saw the YouTuber name " drhomer38" das me! No I'm not a Dr it was just a cringy name from my younger days ðŸ˜…
