So, I've had this happen a few times where I'll get some diet Dew, in cans, and upon drinking it there's this weird...lack of flavor taste? I know it's weird, but the best way to describe it is a a weird off carbonation to flavor ratio. For a while it went away but every few weeks it seems to come back. 

Am I weird or is anyone else experiencing it?
