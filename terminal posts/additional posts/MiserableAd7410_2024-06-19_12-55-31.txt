Hi. Head and neck cancer since 2011. 'Cured' 2011-2023.
Last year several major operations and now considered incurable. 
The main hospital I was at  recommended palliative Keytruda and Cisplatin combined.
Just before my 1st dose at my own countries hospital, the doctor decides to just do Keytruda. 
Any reason why do you think?
He says its because he doesn't want to hurt my hearing...really? 

I don't have faith in my country's medical services, they always screw me up. 

Eg just now, the nurse comes in saying she's here to give me Keytruda and then chemotherapy. 

I said but the doctor just told me only Keytruda. She wouldn't budge until I asked for the main doctor to come and explain to me what the hell was going on. 

She went off in a huff and came back saying 'well he didn't tell me'. 

Thank God I wasn't sleeping. 

Any idea why, apart from being less aggressive treatment would he just change the orders of the biggest cancer center in Europe?
