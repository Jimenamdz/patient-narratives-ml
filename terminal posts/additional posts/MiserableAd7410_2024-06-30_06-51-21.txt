Hello all. 

Palliative Keytruda. 1st infusion 19th June. Tumour in throat and neck growing fast. Pain becoming uncontrolled. 

Been told two weeks, and if it works I should begin feeling positive effects.

Any one have experience of when it worked and also, did the pain get worse before? Could the pain I have be due to the drug beginning to work or is it just tumour growing pains?

Fentanyl 50 transdermal, oxynorm 10 instant, Pregabulin 5ml 2x/day isn't touching the pain. Also had an overdose incident this week taking me to hospital with cns depression. 

Paranoid about too much of these cns depressing painkillers but cannot stand the pain either. Conflicted and climbing walls with pain. 

Been told if it works I might get 1 year. If it doesn't, a few months. 

Rambling now I'm afraid. Just would like to hear about any experiences of this phase. I.e. waiting for the Immunotherapy to kick in with pain growing. Lost interest in food and feeling like I'm dying for the 1st time since diagnosis over a year ago. 

Does it get better?

Thanks
