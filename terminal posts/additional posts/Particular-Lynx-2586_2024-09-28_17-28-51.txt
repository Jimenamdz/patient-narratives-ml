Here's some background from my post about this before:

https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/s/3qPpNNpUVe

Basically, because of my treatment, my nose and mouth tend to bleed a lot if I engage in strenuous activity, i.e. sex or anything that raises my heart rate or makes me strain. Aside from that, my sex drive was at 0 due to the medicines.

My husband has been very supportive and hasn't demanded anything of me but I felt bad about the situation and hated that he couldn't get any intimacy.

So I got a ton of suggestions from people here on the sub and some of them really worked! I just wanted to make an update for the good folks here who made great tips.

We tried a lot of things that didn't work for many different reasons. For example, anything related to touching me, such as cuddling or kissing would instantly result in a nosebleed. Basically, anything that would make me horny is a no-no. This was the most significant challenge because his pleasure was based around mine.

But apparently, massages (particularly on his buttocks) really worked. I get no pleasure from using my hands and he hated handjobs, but we found out that he really liked being touched all over his body instead and the oil turned him on as well.

Afterwards, I would use a silicone tool for him (someone suggested this and it's so cool) to simulate sex. All the while, I didn't need to get naked or anything and my heart rate stayed stable. We've been experimenting on blindfolds as well.

Lastly, I found some oral lubrication sprays that someone told me about through DM (thank you for that most of all) that helped prevent bleeding a lot. It allowed me to do oral more comfortably though I'm still terrible at it (lol).

Anyway, things have improved a lot, thanks to you fine folks. You basically saved my dead bedroom! Even if it's just for him, it's enough, and our bond is even stronger now. Thank you!
