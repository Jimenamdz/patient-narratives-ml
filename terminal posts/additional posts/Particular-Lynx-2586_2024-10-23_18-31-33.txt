Things normally go really well between us but tonight, we really exploded.

It all started when I forgot my keys and asked him to come open the door. I know, it's petty. He told me to come to the lobby so he can hand me the keys, as he was in the car with our sleeping daughter and couldn't just leave her there. But my feet hurt and I didn't want to go downstairs again so I kinda got really irritated and snapped.

He then started to semi-mock me by repeatedly telling me that I could walk 30 steps just to get the keys, and I knew I was behaving like a primadonna but I didn't care and yelled at him anyway. I ended up getting the keys anyway. Ugh.

He's right and I know it. But I was so pissed and the argument dragged on into the night and all sorts of things got hashed out in the open. Apparently, he's been really upset that I have no consideration for him and I take his feelings for granted. I didn't really realize this and I thought I'd been giving him plenty of consideration.

I admit I have not been spending as much time with him as I used to, and I tend to be very blunt about things. Also, as I have cancer, our intimacy has been severely limited. He's been very understanding about it but he tonight, his bottle was full and the frustration boiled over.

It was an awful fight. He was crying and I was crying and he ripped his shirt off and we said a lot of stuff we didn't mean. Ugh. I hated it so much.
