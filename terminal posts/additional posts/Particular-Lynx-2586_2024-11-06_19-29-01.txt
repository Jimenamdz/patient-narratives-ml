It's a setback, sure. But since when does the white house dictate who you are and what you do?

Today, you're still a good person who cares about his/her family. Tomorrow, you'll still be that same person. In 4 years, you'll be even better, when America votes for a better leader.

Trump has been in this position in 2016 and the world didn't end. America is still America. You are still you. The amount of damage he can do is overstated and exaggerated.

Remember why you're here. It's not because of some silly election. You're here for your loved ones whether the person sitting in the big chair is wearing red or blue. It doesn't matter what color they got on. You are still you.
