Content:
I'm on Kadcyla and while I'm usually able to control the bleeding, it's been a lot more than usual today. I'm currently already using:

Mouth:

1. Paradontax mouthwash
2. Sea salt in water
3. Biotene mouth spray
4. Sensodyne toothpaste
5. Icy water

Nose:

1. Vaseline
2. Ayr nasal gel
3. Humidifier
4. Ice bags

Does anyone have some other suggestion I could try?
