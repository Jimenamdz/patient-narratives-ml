White blood cells are at 6.06 and platelets are at 101, my best numbers in years!

(Stage 4, on kadcyla, full story in my profile)

I'm particularly focused on those two because I've been struggling with them for so long, particularly the platelets. I've been bleeding nonstop and maybe I'm turning a corner. Triple digit platelets! I never thought I'd see those again.

Anyway, I just wanted to celebrate this minor achievement. Keep fighting!
