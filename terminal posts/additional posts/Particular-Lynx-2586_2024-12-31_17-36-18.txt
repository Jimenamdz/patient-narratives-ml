4 months ago, I made this post here:

A lot has happened since then. Basically, my cancer causes me to bleed when I get excited, preventing us from having sex. My husband and I have experimented on a lot of different things (many stories in my profile, if you're interested). Over the past few months, we've been doing a lot better, with me at least being able to satisfy him in various ways.

Today, on new year's eve, we made another significant step. After an incredibly long time, we finally got to have sex again.

The cause of the bleeding is my platelets being too low due to chemotherapy. Being stage 4, my therapy doesn't have an ending. However, over time, I had steadily made progress on increasing my levels through extreme diet and exercise. Today, I tested myself, and finally got back to normal (lowest end of normal but fuck it). I worked my ass off to get here and I fucking love life.

So this morning, I simply went for it. I dived back into bed upon receiving my results and I shoved it in his face. But it wasn't just the sex. It was like a celebration of our journey together and all the sacrifices we've made. I cried while making love. It was just. . Finally.

I'm not trying to gloat or anything and I apologize if I offend anyone. I just wanted to share to perhaps provide a little hope as well to everyone else struggling here. It's possible, even for someone like me with an incurable disease. Happy new year, everyone.
