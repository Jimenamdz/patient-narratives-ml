Title: Some (probably) stupid questions I can't figure out
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ij1088/some_probably_stupid_questions_i_cant_figure_out/
Content:
1. How do you cycle through units on the same tile?

2. Is there a way to make the unit icons (their marker on top of their heads) bigger? I can barely see them.

3. How do you trade away your excess resources (like ivory)?

4. Why is attacking another unit so brief? I can barely see any fighting or dying animations, is there something I need to turn on?

5. Is it just me or is the text really blurry?

Aside from my lack of simple understanding of some other concepts, great game!
