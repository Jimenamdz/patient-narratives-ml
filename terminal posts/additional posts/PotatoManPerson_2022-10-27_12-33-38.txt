Without trying to start an argument here - I love The Crown because I find their portrayals of the characters interesting. In my opinion, it doesn't paint them in a good light at all. And I agree with that portrayal. I am Irish after all, and the royal family are not praised much over here. 

But I see a lot of fans/defenders of the royal family on this subreddit, and honestly I'm surprised. Are we not watching the same show? I would see The Crown as having the message that the monarchy isn't needed. But maybe I'm biased. 

What are your opinions on the royal family, and how do they compare with how you view the show's portrayal of them? I'm not trying to cause an argument here, I really just am surprised that most didn't have the same views as me after watching the show. So I just want to hear others' opinions.
