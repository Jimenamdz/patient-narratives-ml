Hey everyone, I've been on treatment on and off for Ewing's Sarcoma for a while now. The chemo I'm on now is kind of working, kind of not. And I have a feeling that I'll soon be changing treatments. My doctors offered me some alternatives, which seem fine. But I've read about treatments such as bulsafan/melphalan with a stem cell transplant, and I have brought this up with him before but my doctor kind of just dismissed it and didn't give that good of a reason.

I was considering bringing it up again now that this chemo seems to not be working as well as hoped. Of course I will get advice from my doctor on the matter, but just wondering if anyone here has received this kind of treatment? Honestly I kind of just would like to hear others' experiences, because it's hard to find much detail about it online, as it's not the status quo of treatment.

Thanks!
