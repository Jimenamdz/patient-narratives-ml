So I just reviewed the notes from my MRI that I had on my arm. Not only is the growth on my tricep a recurrence from the same spot it recurred twice before, but the tumor that attacked my lymph nodes, (the reason why I was on chemo) has also came back. And now I have the new mets to the lungs as well. 

I fuckin hate my life ðŸ¤¬
