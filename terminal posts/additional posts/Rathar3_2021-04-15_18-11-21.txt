I made a post awhile ago about PSU's now doing one on Pc maintenance. PC gaming consoles htpc all need normal maintenance. Cleaning off the case and clear plastic/tempered glass is one thing that needs done.

Dust dirt pet hair and even bugs can get inside a pc/gaming device and cause issues. The CPU fan/heatsink need cleaned same as the GPU and PSU. Once they get clogged up with crap they loose cooling and performance can suffer. Things will burn out or fail long before they should.

There are many online videos on how to to this or if you dont feel you can take to someone to have it done.

I have see everything from mouse turds to cockroaches inside pc's and consoles. Cleaning your system will keep it running happy much longer than a dust covered blob.
