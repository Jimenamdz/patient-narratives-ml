Never thought i would be posting this but today i got the results of my petg scan and all the tumors in my lymph nodes are gone. They were surprised from the reactions i got from everyone. They told me in the beginning that there was a small chance this could happen and it did.

The cancer in my throat/stomach was unchanged and i can live with that.

I feel like everything i have gone thru up to this point finally counted for something. Being sick/tired loosing 2 weeks a month for chemo seems not as bad now.

Finally after 10 months and 9 months of every other  week of chemo has paid off.

For those wondering i was given a 10% chance this could happen. I got lucky never ever won anything major or of any real value in my 56 years till now maybe lady luck knew something i didn't!.

And a BUT Goes here This is very rare to happen so not everyone can expect it but we can all hope for it.
