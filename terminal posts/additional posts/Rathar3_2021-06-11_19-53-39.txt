I once worked in a landfill. Among other things we recycled wood into mulch. The locals all got 9 yards free a year but it was not the best stuff but hey its free right. Wrong This woman pulls in and gives me her order sheet Local free 9 yards it says okies i can do that.

She had a small chevy s10 pick up that would hold maybe 3 4 yards at most but she wanted it all NOW! and she wanted the red brick dyed mulch that was 10 bucks a yard. I said sorry i cannot give you the red brick mulch free that's 10 bucks a yard you get the natural (AKA crappy stuff) she went nuts screaming and yelling she was going to talk to the Manager and she was going to call the President of the authority and so on. This went on for 20 minutes till the Manager showed up and told her no!

Then she said i wont make 2 trips so i want it all now!. The Manager says do it. I got in our big cat loader that had a 9 yard bucket ran into the pile drove up to her dinky lil pickup and said READY?

Her eyes were bugging out and she was speechless. The manager already tired of dealing with people all day on a Saturday said might wanna open the glove box and walked away. She said i will come back.

So i got the lil bobcat loader filled her up and when she came back she was a sweet as pie.

I have many stories from working there i had to quit because i dont deal well with the public and this was 20+ years ago.
