Hello all its been a year since i started Chemo and found out i had cancer. 26 chemo cycles later it still sucks. After having many tumors i am down to one which shocked everyone but that one grew to twice it's size so the put me back on both chemo drugs again.

Yes you can live with cancer but its not fun.

My blood work is all normal and good overall health is good. They say other than the cancer i am healthy (still cant wrap my head around that) 

The tumor in my throat pretty much stopped me eating for awhile but thats gotten better.

The 2 drugs i am on right now are Oxaliplatin and Fluororacil this is my seconds time on both.

Not sure i am beating it but its still going.

Live your life as you would always and enjoy the day.
