Got the Struts and strut spreaders on. Wings are both Equal that took about 4 hours of sanding test fitting the doing all over again. It takes 10 8-32 bolts for the wings and 4 2-56 screws for strut spreaders.

Its still a work in progress and in no hurry to mess it up. Over all its been kinda a pain due to Balsa usa changing things then not up dating the instruction book or giving a update in the kit. Somethings you just have to figure out yourself. I would not recommend this to someone whos not built alot of kits but someone whos built a few would have no issues.

Going with the robarts landing gear its ordered just waiting. for it.
