Hey everyone :) 

TW: talking mildly about my issues with my body appearance during chemo.

 Wanted to just see if there’s anyone on here currently doing their chemo without steroids now and what their experience has been with it. 

I’ve got bilateral AVN from my initial chemo treatment and am now on relapse treatment. 

I did my last few rounds of my initial chemo last year with 50% less Dex due to the AVN and I found no difference to my nausea. I’ve also always been able to eat food and keep my weight on throughout treatments even when I’ve been super nauseous. I’m just really sick of the steroid face and not being able to sleep + gaining weight like crazy when I exercise every day and do all the right things. My cancer is currently incurable so I’m just wanting to sleep better, feel better about myself and not be so upset every time I take a photo with my partner and see the horrible moon that is my face just glaring back at me. 

I’m also hopeful that I may be getting married soon?!? I’d like to just enjoy that and not feel like violet (blueberry version from Willy wonka) and just not myself. 

I know it’s all so trivial and vain but so many other things are outside of my control already and as much as I try I cannot stop caring about how I look and it’s really getting me down as I try enjoy my last year or whatever of life.
