Hey everyone :) 

Happy new year to you all, I hope everyone is as okay as they can be. 

I had my chemo pushed back two weeks due to wanting to do a quick trip overseas and Christmas falling in the middle of the chemo round. 

I was due for my new round on Monday of CT for my relapse in my lungs, recent scans had shown a mixed response so we were going to do one more round before scanning again mid January. 

Couple days ago I started getting some tightness in my chest and a bit of pain there when coughing or taking a deep breath in (pain would start halfway through the breath). Monitored it and came home early then spiked a fever the other day so went to ER. They gave me fluids and antibiotics as well as did an Xray and CT to see if there was any infection in my lungs. Although no infection they did find new tumors in my lung lining, I haven’t had tumors here before. They pretty much just sent me home and I see my oncologist on Monday before I’m supposed to be doing chemo. I’m not too sure what’s going to happen to that now. 

The pain in my lungs remains and I’m starting to freak out a little, anyone who has had tumors in the lung lining has this affected whether you can do radiation? Has this also caused other health issues faster? 

I think the next chemo I can do is IT, then there’s one more covered after that before id have to try cabo which will cost me $11,000 every two months. I have no way of getting that money.
