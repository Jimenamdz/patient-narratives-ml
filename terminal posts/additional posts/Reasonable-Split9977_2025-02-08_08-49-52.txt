Update 9/02 4:48pm - wow, my hospital room feels so incredibly lonely sometimes but with this amazing community all supporting eachother it makes all the difference. Thank you so much for all the love, I’m so incredibly grateful for all of you. 


I (24f) have known with this relapse that my cancer wasn’t curable and that we were slowly getting into scary territory. But things have progressed so much in the last few weeks that my oncologist and team had the convo with me yesterday basically explaining that there’s so much disease growing so fast that chemo (if it does work) isn’t likely to help before the cancer kills me. 

I’m sad :( I was hoping for more time as we all do. I’ve had to have the difficult convo with my parents and friends. Don’t even get me started on how hard this is with my partner of over six years. 

I so badly want to stay, this all feels so unfair. 

I get to go home on Monday which is a relief and they’ll be delivering me my oxygen tank so it’s there if I need it. I know I’ll be comfortable and I’m going to still keep doing my chemo if I get the chance but man I’m just so lost rn. 

Thanks for letting me vent and if you read this. Sending so much love to everyone on this subreddit.
