Title: Black/dark brown spot inside cheek, should I worry?

I think it's just from accidentally biting my cheek but I'd appreciate second thoughts to soothe my anxiety. 23F, not a smoker though my parents were in my youth. I'm worried because my mother died from cancer earlier this month, most likely from smoking, and I've always been paranoid.
