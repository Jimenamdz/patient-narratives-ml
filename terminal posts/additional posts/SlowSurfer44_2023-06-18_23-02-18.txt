I'm about to start this unexpected battle I never thought I be in. I am looking for hope from other who have fought and won. I need to know their is hope that I can neat this. I'm trying looking across the country to figure out what doctor or clinic will actually try to save my life. I have a 2 year old some and I want to be here and help him become a man. If you did become cancer free tell me what you did and what treatments you did. I'm looking for help. Please help me fight sp I can see my little boy grow up. I know it's going to be a very hard fight but I know it's possible I met people who have beat it. Please give me your story of how you won.
