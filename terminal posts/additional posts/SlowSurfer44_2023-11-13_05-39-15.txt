 So I was diagnosed in June 2023  and this is really hard I keep telling myself I can beat this. I have mets in lung and liver around 6 total in lungs and 5 spots on liver. I responded well to treatment with was capox the first rd then cap/avastin. My oncologist doesn't want to do surgery I scheduled a  thoracic surgeon appointment Monday in another state he also does lung suffision.  So I'm going to talk to him because the one thing I need to have a chance to beat this is surgery. It sounds like the thoracic surgeon wants to do surgery and if that's the case I'm going to do it. I am trying really hard to fight and try to become  cancer free.  I want to see my son grow up to a man and grow old with my wife and I just have to try do whatever it takes ro beat this.
