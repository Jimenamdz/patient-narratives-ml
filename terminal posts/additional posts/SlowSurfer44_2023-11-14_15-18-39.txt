So I have lined up a thoracic surgeon and a liver surgeon I hope the liver surgeon has a Dr who can do my colon as well. I spoke to Dr.Demmy Todd and I sent him my scan and from the talk he wanted to have a appointment so we can talk about surgery. I meet with my liver surgeon next week who is aggressive so I'm that after he sees my scans that he will do surgery or give me a road map to being a candidate. I was going back and forth on if I should wait until my 2nd scans to look to try to get surgery as my oncologist did I was inoperable( I know that can change) but after  talking to surviors they all wanted surgery found surgeons who would do it and now they are cured. Please have me in your thoughts that I find Dr's who are willing to do the surgeries. I really think i will and I honestly feel like I will beat this if they can just get this crap out of my body. I know a recurrence is possible but I truly feel I can beat this if I have surgery.
