So I met with my Thoracic surgeon and I'm all approved for surgery, sort, and suffusion. I'm so happy that I have all the doctors lined up to work on me. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. Though I truly believe in the depths of my soul I will beat this.  When I think of my chances and not lie to myself I feel a sense of calm that everything will turn out the postive. I am so happy that now I have a opportunity to see my two year old grow up and my wife who I have been with since I was 19 that well will grow old together. I made a promise to my wife that I will always be by her side. We always tell each other we will be together forever and I intend to keep this promise. I know that's not something you have control over but I will try my hardest to be by her side. My family needs me and I will do anything to be by there side. Thank you all who have supported me on this journey and I think of all of you everyday. Remember to always fight never give up.
