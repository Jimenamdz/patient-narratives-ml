Tomorrow on Valentines day I am having surgery to remove the spots on my liver and  primary rectum tumor. Both are cleared of cancer they just want to remove the spots as a precaution. Since I started this journey in July I have had no setbacks. I responded well to chemo and every spot where the cancer was has cleared up. I have only one spot in lung and I will have surgery after I recover from my surgery tomorrow.  I am so happy that I am almost clear. I can't edit until it's all put of my body. F cancer I'm am beating it and  will ultimately defeat this. I will keep you guys posted after surgery to let you know how how things are going. Keep me in your thought and prayers guys!
