Title: [PubQ] : I wrote a book about cancer in the format of an illustrated children fairy tale book and I have a question about fonts

Basically I am using Photoshop to fit the text in the pages, but I'm very afraid of using a font and then discover it is protected by copyright and have its maker sue me. How could I possibly figure out if a font even advertised as free of copyright really is free to use as I see fit?
