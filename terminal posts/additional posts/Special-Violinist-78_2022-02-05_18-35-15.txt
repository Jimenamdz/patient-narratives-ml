Title: Says she's playing radio, doesn't play anything

When I say "Play (band name) radio" she replies "Playing (band name) radio on Spotify" and then doesn't play anything. I repeat and same outcome. It feels like it happens 50% of the time so Super annoying, but probably more like 20%. Any ideas?
