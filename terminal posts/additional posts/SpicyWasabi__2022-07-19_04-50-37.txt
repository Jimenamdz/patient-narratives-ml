Title: Is location updating frozen for anyone else?

I was trying to collect some new stamps today and I noticed I can no longer update my location as it doesn’t let me. I know there was a topic posted a month back about an update where Slowly no longer lets you change your location but despite not updating my app I’m only having the problem now. Anyone else experiencing this?

EDIT: It’s been resolved! Must’ve just been an app glitch
