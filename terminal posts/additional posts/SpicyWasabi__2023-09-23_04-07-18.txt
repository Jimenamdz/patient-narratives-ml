Title: How to turn on ‘Accepting New Friends’?

I recently took a massive break and came back to a huge update to the Slowly interface. I wanted to turn on Accepting New Friends to start connecting with people again but I can’t seem to find the button and now I’m unsure if people can view my profile. Are we just reduced to open letters now? Does anyone else have this problem? I used to receive tons of letters a week but now I have received none within a week and I think it’s due to the fact I can’t turn on my accepting new friends button.
