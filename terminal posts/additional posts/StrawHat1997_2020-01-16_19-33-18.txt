Haven't listened to it yet, I wasn't in a hurry to do so.. but now apparently I am.

Anyway, this sub is awesome. Coldplay will live forever and they'll keep bringing joy to people.

The only thing that saddens me is that I won't ever get to see their new releases, I won't ever get to see them live, I won't ever be able to listen to their music again. I really wanted to meet them at some point, a picture with them or a message from them would've meant the world for me. But hey, life is what it is.

But it's been a wild ride, thanks to the guys, thanks to you all
