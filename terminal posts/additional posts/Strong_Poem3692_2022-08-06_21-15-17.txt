Hey guys,
I‘m a BC patient since 2019 and found out that my PALB2 gene has a mutation.
There’s a lot going around about BRCA1 and 2- but there’s hardly any data on PALB2.
I’m having my second mastectomy in September and will also have a hysterectomy.
Does anyone else have that PALB2 mutation and already has cancer?
I really don’t want to do the surgery but I promised my family to do whatever it takes…
