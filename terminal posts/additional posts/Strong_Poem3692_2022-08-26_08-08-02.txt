Hey you fellow fighters,
after all I’ve been through with my disease and my son having a lymphoma by age 11 I have a huge (diagnosed) trauma/phobia regarding hospitals.
I’m taking every measure possible but maybe you have some more ideas.
What I already did: I informed my doctors, I had my psychiatrist write a statement about it and recommend a stay as short as possible, I signed up for medical service who comes to my home daily after the surgery to give me meds and check my wounds and drainages. My aunt, who’s a professional caregiver will move in with us as long as we need her. I hired a babysitter (I’m a mom of 3).
So for the time after the surgery I’m not concerned. But I’m so freaking scared about the hospital stay. I don’t wanna sleep over there. The smell gives me shivers, the drains, the beeping sounds, … everything reminds me of my son asking me to let him just die 😭. I’m so scared of being alone. Do you have any other ideas what I can do to “survive” mentally?
