Title: Constantly fighting with your significant other about things that were caused by your cancer?

Content:
As my cancer progresses, my partner becomes more and more aggressive and is picking fights I can’t even argue about. It’s about me not bringing any money to the table, it’s about me being a bad housewife basically because I can’t do this and that. I feel like I can’t do anything right these days. As his aggression progresses, he recently started smashing his fists against walls, slamming doors and throwing things across the room (to be fair: never something that breaks).
Who’s significant other is also coping with your cancer with anger/aggression?
