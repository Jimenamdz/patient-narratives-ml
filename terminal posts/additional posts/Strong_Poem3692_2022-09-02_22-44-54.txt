After having bc since 2019 with a fast recurrence after just 9 months,
I’m a terminal cancer patient by now. 
My doctors (3, independently from each other) advised me to have a 2nd mastectomy and my ovaries and Fallopian tubes removed. They’re planning to do everything at once mid October. It is a rough approach but I promised my family and kids (I’m a 37yo. mom of 3). 
Did anyone have the same or a similar surgery? How long did you stay at the hospital? I remember how painful my first mastectomy was the first time. How did you deal with the pain and which meds did you take? How long did it take until you were “fit” again? I had 2 big drainages for 14 days.
I’m scared. I’m so scared that something could go wrong during the surgery. My bf said I should be happy that I finally have an appointment for it.
Also, I’m in tears about losing my ovaries.
But yeah, the cancer takes everything I have- including my beauty, my mental strength, my sanity and eventually my life. I just don’t want to do it anymore 😭.
