Title: Anyone else waiting for mastectomy-day?

Content:
My 2nd mastectomy is going to be on Oktober 18. Some days I almost forget, sometimes I become very anxious thinking of the upcoming surgery.
I remember how painful it was the first time and how I was surprised about that fact. I have a (diagnosed) anxiety disorder against hospitals. I take meds, I have therapy sessions weekly and a group session which is also weekly. So I’m doing whatever I can to make it easier. I don’t know how I manage those things because actually, I’m very depressed at the moment. 🤷🏻‍♀️
You guys have any advice on what to pack in your hospital bag for a mastectomy?
