Exhausted my FMLA and went out on long term disability for cancer. Microsoft notified me that I was laid off and my position eliminated. Everyone else on my team got new roles except me. MS legal and private attorney both say Microsoft has technically colored within the lines and there is too much difficulty to prove the case. I'm totally fucked. Meanwhile our landlord had been offering us a discounted rate for rent but turns out it was given as a loan and he sent us a bill for $30k so now we're going to be evicted. Our credit is too bad to get a new place and even if we could my LTD income is not guaranteed. The odds of me ever working again are near nil. Even if I could get back to work I only have a few years to live. Unsure what I should be doing. I was a software engineer. I'm so fucked. No idea how we're going to survive.
