Content:
My cancer is not curable, but I'm also not technically definable as terminal as I'm expected to live more than a couple years- but my iodine resistant thyroid cancer has a low probability of survival to even 10 years. Ive already had two radical neck dissections and am not really thinking im going to do any more. I have new nodules that are growing and I dont know what is worth doing about them.  
I just want to get this shitshow overwith and get my wife my life insurance and stop this fucking ratrace.
