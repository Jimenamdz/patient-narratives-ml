Got laid off a little bit ago and have LTD but can't find a place to live with our credit (<680). We have to find somewhere new because our landlord sent us a $30,000 bill for back rent from a "discount" that he offered us which we thought was just decreased rent but is apparently a loan. Lawyer has told him he can pound sand but we need to move and I can't find anything let alone the energy to physically move everything we own. I just want to give up.
