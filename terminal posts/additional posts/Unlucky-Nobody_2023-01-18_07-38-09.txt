Just over a year ago I (40m) was diagnosed with thoracic sarcoma. Stage 4 not curable, I was started on maintenance chemo which I have responded really well to. I live with my mum and she is my primary caretaker. For now I Feel mostly healthy aside from typical chemo side effects. 

6 months ago my mum was diagnosed with lung cancer (carcinoma I think? I struggle to keep up with my own diagnosis details) no we have been supporting each other through treatment. She has had radiation, chemo and surgery to remove an adrenal glad and has tolerated it really well. We have been able to lean on each other for support and have been getting by okay.

Now for the 2023 plot twist. Mums brain MRI results came in today and show multiple lesions and tumours scattered throughout. They are planning to do whole brain radiation and have basically given her 12 months. Any advice on how to manage this treatment would be appreciated. And if anyone has experience with using Memantine to preserve memory function I would like to know more as this has been recommended by her oncologist.

Hugs all round to everyone here going through a hard time. Obligatory Fuck cancer!
