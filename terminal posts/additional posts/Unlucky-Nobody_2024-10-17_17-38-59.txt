A bleed from a brain lesion left her unresponsive. She passed away in hospital 10 days later. 

I stayed with her as much as I could, Sleeping on a bench in her room at the hospital and I was with her at the very end. Whispering encouragement to go and stroking her face.

The nursing staff did an incredible job making her comfortable but a skeleton crew over the weekend and at night meant I was helping a lot.

It's been hard and I'm physically and emotionally exhausted 

She had just about every treatment in the end and took them all like a champ. Surgery first to remove an adrenal gland along with some chemo. She also had a targeted therapy called tegrisso that continued to the end.

Then came the brain mets and targeted radiation. finally whole brain radiation as a last resort. 

It has been heart breaking to watch this amazing woman and talented artist slowly fade away and I'm glad it's over for her. The last thing she managed to say was "I love you". It hurt so much seeing her like that.

My heart goes out to all of you going through something similar.
