Title: I Survived!  (So far…)

I want to write a victory post as I have been very ill lately but now I am resting comfortably at home, in my own bed!

I have terminal lung cancer and I developed pneumonia behind the tumor in my left lung. It then developed abscesses that the antibiotics could not penetrate. After trying to treat it unsuccessfully for weeks the decision was made that my only chance was a serious surgery in which they would go into my lung and scrape it out, leaving chest tubes to drain out the junk. 

They told me that the surgery had a high mortality rate and that if I survived I would be in ICU for days afterward. I went for it. I woke up with 3 large chest tubes coming out of my back, and I was in a world of pain. Luckily I managed to recover quickly, spending a week after the surgery in the hospital and then being discharged to home!  

I’m on IV antibiotics for the next month at home and I have lung exercises that I do here at home also. We are hopeful that the infection is being wiped out for good. I just wanted to share my situation to give others some hope. I’m grateful and happy to share this. Praying that the past 19 days in the hospital have “fixed” me!!  All appreciation goes to my surgeons and doctors and one awesome PA.
