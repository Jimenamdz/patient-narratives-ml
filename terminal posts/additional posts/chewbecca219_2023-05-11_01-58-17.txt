Title: Brain mets and lingering pain

So I had two craniotomies to remove my breast cancer brain met. The second one was to fix a spinal fluid leak, and started my recovery over. I continue to have headaches and auras. I weaned off steroids but am now weaning again bc I had no energy. 
Now I have a place on the back of my head that feels like it's bruised. To the right of my scar. I’m wondering if this is where he "patched" my skull, and why I didn't feel it earlier. Anyone with this experience, please share. Everyone from neuro to onc says this recovery is normal. Oh, initial surgery was March 1 and spinal fluid surgery was March 17. I’m walking ok, struggle getting out of low chairs but I’m back at work part time, so I imagine I’m fortunate. Thanks for reading!
