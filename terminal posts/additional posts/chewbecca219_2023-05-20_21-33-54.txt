Title: Experience with Tucatinib?

I started a trial at Duke on Wednesday. I know I’m fortunate as it's hard to qualify. I was diagnosed triple + in May 2021 and stage 1b, with spread to lymph nodes. 
I was NED until February 2023 when we found a metastasis in my brain. We removed the tumor and did radiation (hello unexpected bald patches). After much testing, the spread was limited to my brain, so I started the trial this week. 
The trial pairs HP (part of my original regimen) with Tucatinib. What side effects have you experienced with Tucatinib? I’m used to the HP side effects, but have never taken an oral chemo. Do side effects build up over time?
Thank you for your input. I’m happy to be part of this group!
