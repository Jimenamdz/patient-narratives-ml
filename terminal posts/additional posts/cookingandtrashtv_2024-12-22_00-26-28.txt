As title said. For better or for worse right? I said those words once and meant them but my ex husband left and ruined my life and our kids lives. I say it, I mean it. So guys. I am devastated beyond words, we found out a month ago and our worlds fell apart. He proposed, we cried, got therapists, cried again, he moved in with his daughter and we just decided fuck cancer. Fuck it. But I desperately need suggestion for activity for me to do on Monday or Tuesday / Plano / Dallas / Richardson is ok so I can retain some sanity and support system. It’s terminal so he has 1-5 years. This type of cancer he will 100% fie from. One day I will wake up and he will be gone. I will be alone again and devastated and I don’t have a family at all besides my 4 year old twins. Help with suggestions of what to do because I don’t know anymore what there is to do or what I can do to retain that or even form something I can hold on to WHEN not if he dies. I have cried every day on my way to work and back and have gotten on depression and anxiety meds for now but that’s a different issue. So if you read this far or even have had a spouse or partner pass away please suggest anything. I’m lost.  Edit : not religious
