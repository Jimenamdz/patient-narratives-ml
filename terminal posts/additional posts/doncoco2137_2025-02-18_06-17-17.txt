Title: Struggling with Headphones After Losing Hearing in One Ear

Hello,  

I recently became deaf in my left ear due to cancer in my neck/temporal bone. To be honest, hearing with only one ear isn’t that bad—sure, there are tough days, but it’s not the end of the world.  

The thing is, I’ve completely given up listening to music through headphones. I’ve always been a music person, always carrying my headphones whenever I could. Sure, I still listen to music in my apartment through speakers, and I still game like I used to—just without headphones. I tried using my right ear with them, but it’s just so frustrating and irritating when the audio is streamed directly to only one side. My guess is that I adjust more easily when the sound fills the whole room through speakers.  

Have any of you dealt with the same issue? I’ve read through your posts, and from what I see, all of you seem to manage just fine with only one ear.  

For me, it’s just really hard. I constantly travel on public transport and trains across my country, and I’ve ended up just choosing silence while reading a book. It’s just… sad.
