Hello everyone!! No one in my family has gone through this so I thought I would ask here 

I am 25 I was diagnosed at 24 last April with  - - - invasive doctoral carcinoma. I have had 16 rounds of chemo 4 of them was the “red devil” and I had 4 rounds of the zoladex shots in my stomach to hopefully preserve my ovaries. Has anyone had their periods come back after this or has had a similar experience?
