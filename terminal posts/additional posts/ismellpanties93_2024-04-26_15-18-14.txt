Hi lovely souls! My follow up with my onc is coming up on may 15th and for the first time in a while I’m scared treatment has stopped working. I’m currently on enhertu which has shown great effect so far but I’ve only been on it since November. Back then I had been stable on taxol for over a year, but as y’all know things can move incredibly fast and at that time I went from having only bone mets to have it spread to my liver and my brain. 

I know I still have a few more chemos to try but it’s starting to run low and I’m scared. I’ve been feeling some pain in my hip where my bone mets are most significant and in my liver. But I have such a hard time knowing if it’s my mind making it up or not. Usually I don’t experience pain at all and I’m not on any pain killers or anything. 

I’m just so scared enhertu has failed me already and looking at just a couple more options left I fear I won’t live to see the next Christmas. 

My husband and I have finally saved up enough to buy a flat and I just want to see that through so bad. But it will be a few months at least before we’re even ready to place a bid on anything. I am just scared right now and spiraling a little. I’m only 30 and this illness has taken 4 years of my life. I guess I’m just hoping for someone to talk me off the ledge right now. 

I’m in this lovely group chat but we’ve had a couple of deaths lately and it’s been a tense few days. So I didn’t want to burden anyone with my potentially baseless fears. 

Thanks for reading a rambling girl’s thoughts. ❤️
