Starting chemo today.  Two meds that I can’t pronounce or remember.  Hoping to get approval for immunotherapy soon as well.  The scary part for me is that I still need to get my pet scan.  If it comes back that nothing spread, we are throwing the kitchen sink at it, then going to an aggressive surgeon (oncologists exact wording).  If it has spread, however, there’s nothing we can do.  I’m ready to fight.  I love a good fight.  What scares me is there is the chance that there won’t be an option to fight.  Half of me wants to get the pet scan and find out, the other half of me wants to not know and just hold on to hope.  Obviously, I will get the scan, but damn, it all hinges on that.  Either way, I leave my house in less than an hour to start kicking the shit out of this thing!  LET’S GO!
