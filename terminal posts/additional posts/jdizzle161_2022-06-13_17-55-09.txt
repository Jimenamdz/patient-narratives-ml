Got my first session of immunotherapy on Friday along with my two chemos after my off week.  I was fine Friday, tired Saturday, and dead to the world yesterday and today.  I have zero energy.  Been laying in my recliner all day.  I have to really gather myself to even get to the bathroom.  

Does this happen to anyone else?  I hope this doesnâ€™t last too much longer.  I have things to do, and I really want to get to work on Wednesday and Thursday.  I just started going back twice a week (I usually work a four day week) last week.  I want to get back into some routine, but damn is this kicking my ass!
