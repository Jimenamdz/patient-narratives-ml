Title: Radiation sucks!

About to start week three of radiation for bile duct cancer.  First week was fine.  Tired, but that’s about it.  This past week, the pain kicked in.  Chest hurts, what feels like the worst acid reflux I have ever had, and it’s hard to eat.  Eating or drinking anything causes pain.  I just took an oxy so that I can actually sleep tonight.  I go in tomorrow, and I plan on talking with my oncologist to see if there is anything that we can do to mitigate the suck!

Anyone else deal with this?  Any tricks?
