Title: Getting a port Wednesday. When you got yours, did they put you under?

I avoided a port through my first round of chemo (burned out all my veins from it).  For some reason the port freaks me out.  Can’t avoid it this time, as the Folfox requires a 48 hour pump.  Anyone here get one?  Do they put you under, or just give you a local?  I’ll hand them a frying pan and go Saturday morning cartoon!  I want animated baby birds flying around my head.  I don’t want to be awake when this shit happens!!!!
