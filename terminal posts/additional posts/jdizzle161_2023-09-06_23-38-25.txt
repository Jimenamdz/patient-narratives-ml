Been having trouble keeping food down lately.  I’m on Folfox, and it’s kicking my ass.  Most times I eat something solid, I spit it back up.  We are doing a Ct scan soon, then I may be getting another endoscopy done.  My numbers are down, so the pain and loss of appetite are a concern. 

Anyone have any good protein shake recipes?  I got one from Smoothie King today with strawberry protein, raspberries, and frozen yogurt.  It was good, but I’m not going to keep buying $10 smoothies!
