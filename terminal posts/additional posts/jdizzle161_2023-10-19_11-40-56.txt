Title: Thank you to this sub

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone in this sub.  A few days ago, I really hit my breaking point, and went on a bit of a rant.  The fact that people took the time to read, react, comment, and support me, I truly believe, helped me over that hump.  This is truly the kindest, most compassionate sub on this stupid website, and has gotten me through so much.  I wish this sub never had to exist in the first place, but I really do hope people find it, and find the hope, support and light that comes from it. 

We really are in this bullshit together, and just know, I am rooting for each and everyone of you 100%!


Thanks for hearing me out yet again!
