Just got my CA19-9’s back from earlier this week, and they have dropped significantly.  Obviously, zero is always the goal, but every step forward is a win in my books.  On September 1st, my numbers jumped up to 12,327.4.  My most recent was 3674.3.  That lifted me up quite a bit yesterday.  Still in a ton of pain, and back to having trouble eating, but one step at a time.  I have my next immunotherapy treatment Monday, and Tuesday I finally start physical therapy so I can relearn how to walk.  Back in the beginning of October, we had found this thing traveled to my brain.  We did 10 sessions of full brain radiation.  Can’t wait to get in for an mri or ct scan to see if we wiped that out.  Just have to wait a bit I guess.  

Either way, it’s so great getting that glimmer of hope to squeeze and hold on to.  I told my oncologist and my radiation oncologist that it’s going to take more that that to stop me, and the only thing that can knock me down at this point is a freight train (well, maybe after the PT so I’m steadier on my feet first!)

Hope you all get good news like I did!
