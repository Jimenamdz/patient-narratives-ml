Went to the hospital and ended up having my first ever surgery.  They were able to clear out a ton of necrotic tissue that was in my gut.  Unfortunately there is also Mets to my spine.  Basically, I am going to spend the rest of my life in bed, not able to walk.  Right now I’m still recovering from the surgery.  That’s my main goal right now.  I want to be able to actually eat, and be able to move freely in the bed.   I want to be able to move more comfortably in this bed. It gets uncomfortable.   I a scared, and the way they dropped the news on my just pissed me off, and scared the shit out of me.  I have to figure it all out.  This shit absolutely sucks.  Telling my 8 yr old son was devastating.  I never was an emotional person, but I have cried so much over the past few days.  I am so thankful for the nursing crew at the hospital I was at.  I don’t think I would have made it through those first few nights without them.  This shit just sucks.  No way around it.  

On top of this, my buddy just told me his father died today, landing another big blow. That was crushing.  His father was a great man, and the only thing that kept him together.  It’s been a shitty week.
