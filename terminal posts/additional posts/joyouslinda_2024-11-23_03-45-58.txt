A true miracle from God and so much prayer!! Neither one of us died!! He was missing for quite a while and I was hospitalized multiple times. (I believe the stress was more than I could bear along with my cancer. )He called one day and had checked himself into a Christian based year long rehab near me. I immediately felt a weight lifted off of my shoulders. I am defying the doctors by getting off of oxygen, hiking 2 to 3 miles day and feeling great!! My son calls me twice a week and I see him on Sundays. 😊 Thank you to all of you who responded and said a prayer. Miracles happen!! Really they do. God is so good. Love to you all 💕🙏
