Content:
*2L O2 via NC*: “Two liters of oxygen via nasal canula”. The amount of oxygen being supplied to a patient through a nasal canula, which is that plastic thing under the nose of every attractive dying teenager on that medical drama you like.

*87F / 48M* : “87 year old female,” “48 year old male,” respectively. By not writing out the full *year old*, *female* and *male*, you save approximately 6 minutes of keystrokes per year. Also makes your chart notes look hella cool compared to those written by squares.

*ABG* : “Arterial Blood Gas”. A way of checking the pH, oxygenation and amount of CO2 dissolved in the blood (along with a few other things) as an indirect test of lung function or certain metabolic processes. Obtained by jamming a needle into a wrist and hitting an artery directly which hurts like a sonofabitch apparently.

*ACLS* : “Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support”. CPR with bells, whistles and venous access.

*Adds / new adds* : Short for “new additional patients”. A new patient added to your *Census*. Usually translates to a lot more chart reading than you had planned on doing that day. 

*Adenosine* : The Cardiologist’s answer to, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?”

*Afib* : Short for “atrial fibrillation”. Instead of the heart going lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub, it’s more like luuuuu- dub, dub, lu-, dub, luuuuuuuuu- dub like the world’s shittiest Skrillex cover. Can lead to strokes.

*AMS* : “Altered Mental Status”. Bonkers. Nuts. Emphatically in favor for Cocoa Puffs.

*ARDS* : “Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome”. A rapidly progressing flashflood of the lungs leading patients to get intubated and/or die drowning in a hospital bed. 

*Ativan :* An injectable Jell-O shot. 

*Atropine :* Make-heart-go juice. 

*Attending* : A physician who can practice medicine independently and subsequently earns fat stacks of Benjamins. A full grown doctor, in contrast to the *Resident*.

*Baseline* : The patient’s normal health, whatever that may be. 

*Basilar rales* : A rattling / bubbly sound heard near the lower end of the lungs using a *stethoscope* – the doctor thingy that comes with the “Sexy Nurse” Halloween costume.

*BIPAP* : “Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure”. Clear plastic Bane mask with an elephant trunk on the front hooked up to a machine that pushes air in and pulls air out of poorly functioning lungs. Used for sleep apnea or for inpatients with respiratory failure as a step before full intubation. 

*B/L* : “Bilateral”. Both sides of the body. 

*BMP* : “Basic Metabolic Panel”. Routine blood test that measures the electrolytes that plants crave. Used by nurses to wake up some poor *Intern* at 3AM to inform them Mrs \_\_\_\_ in one twenty five room two has a potassium of 3.4 and should we do something about that?

*Bradycardic* : A heartrate slower than 60 beats per minute. Not to be confused with *Bradycardio*, the short-lived 70s workout series featuring a mixed family doing jumping jacks while looking at various sides of their tiny boxes.

*Cachectic* : Scarily thin. Like Nazi death camp thin. 

*Case* : Interchangeable with “patient,” but more dehumanizing since it’s condensing a human being down to their *Chief Complaint* or *Diagnosis*.

*CNA* : “Certified Nursing Assistant”. Something you never want to mistake a real nurse for.

*CICU* : “Cardiac Intensive Care Unit”. A level of care above a regular *MedSurg* hospital bed specializing in monitoring complications involving the heart. 

*CCU* : “Critical Care Unit”. A level of care above a regular *MedSurg* hospital bed, but below the Intensive Care Unit.

*Census*: List of patients you’re taking care of that day. As with genitals, do not touch without the owner’s permission please.

*Central Line* : Think of an IV, but jammed in the neck. Minor surgical procedure done in the ICU, part of the “I don’t want to die on a bunch of tubes and wires” collection of medically necessary horrors. 

*CHF Exacerbation* : “Congestive Heart Failure exacerbation”. One of the leading causes of routine hospitalization. A bug in God’s design where the human body senses the old ticker ain’t doing too hot and tries to fix it the dumbest way possible by turning the lungs into a kiddie pool.

*Chief Complaint* :  The final straw. Whatever brought the patient in. 

*CIWA Protocol* : “Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol”. A defined schedule to give *Ativan* or similar medications to patients in alcohol withdrawal. Used in context of the not-uncommon speculation among the medically-inclined, *“Would I have to go on CIWA protocol if I got admitted?”* given the amount of wine and martini quaffing nurses and MDs accomplish during their down time.

*CKD* : “Chronic Kidney Disease”. Exactly what it says on the tin. Also a medical billing checkbox for “*Money, pwease!*” Can lead to the need for dialysis.

*Coumadin* : Rat poison. Also used to prevent blood clots.

*CMP* : “Complete Metabolic Panel”. A more thorough blood test than a *BMP,* includes liver function markers.

*Code* : The word you put before some shade of the rainbow to make it horrible and depressing. Used in overhead PA announcements so that the entire hospital hears a calm “Code pink, labor and delivery,” instead of, “OH SHIT SOMEONE STOLE AN INFANT EVERYONE START BARRICADING THE JOINT”

*CPR* : “Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation”. Yes, Cardiopulmonary stands for two letters. A violent medical procedure with a success rate of 75% on TV and about 15% in real life.

*Crashed* : Like *Tanked* but worse. Not entirely synonymous with *Coded*, but same ballpark.

*CVA* : “Cerebrovascular Accident”. Fancier way of saying stroke.

*CXR* : “Chest X-ray”. That thing the handsome doctors are pondering over instead of just glancing at the radiologist’s report on the intro to that medical show you like.
