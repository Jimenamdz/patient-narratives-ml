I truly cannot get over how much this hits every highlight of Skyrim, every single Fallout, and No Man's Sky.

It has it's faults, but the nostalgia in me remembers Fallout 1 and equipping weird old world weapons with weird caliber rounds and using a menu to walk into the unknown.

I still need to find the right weight-to-cost ratio for items on this one though.
