Title: Jumpgate. It's a shot in the dark, but did anyone/devs ever play this game?

The targeting system and flight dynamics bring me back to that small MMORPG game. It's so old you could buy CDs to install it.

I was a terror in it (top 3 kill count in the game, never pirated) and I fondly remember being a teen as my younger brother worked the targeting system while I picked off enemy pilots. 

Maybe all space sims share this DNA, but it's eerily similar. 

Also for any oldtimers, multimissle was not spam, it was strategic, get wrecked Octavius.
