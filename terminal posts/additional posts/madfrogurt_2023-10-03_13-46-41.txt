Title: Anyone else noticing the touches of humanity more in Starfield than FO4 or Skyrim?

I’m appreciating that it’s not a post-apocalyptic hellscape or random feudal era villages, but rather modern humans who still remember a bitter war and/or are trying to live their lives in whatever society they wound up or grew up in.

It’s a bit crazy, but narratively even playing as a Wanted Bounty Hunter, the writing is so good that I find it very hard to be villainous to most named NPCs.

Spacers still get to get dome dingers to the head from my ridiculously overpowered mag revolver by the hundreds, but the story NPCs all get at least a chance at having a happy ending as much as I can help it.
