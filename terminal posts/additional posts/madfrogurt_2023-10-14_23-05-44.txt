Title: I went searching for titanium, checked a guide which said go to Titan (moon of Saturn) and wound up on a tour guide "quest" about an old colony for the last hour and couldn't be happier.

Never drew my gun, never picked up loot, just followed an upbeat dude around a historic colony in the Sol system.

I haven't collected a single unit of titanium yet and I couldn't care less.
