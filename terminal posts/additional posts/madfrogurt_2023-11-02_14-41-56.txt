Title: A thought about spoilers

I almost wanted to discuss the “ending” but decided against it.

Starfield is a beautiful game about discovery. Any talk about themes or special locations sort of ruins it, and I would never want to ruin the experience even with spoiler tags.

This is a reskinned Fallout 4 with No Man’s Sky and Skyrim all stapled on to it, but the core is discovery.

So the smallest possible spoiler I can give is I’ve enjoyed the first 100 or whatever hours, and I’m looking forward to the next 1000.
