I love medicine.

And at the same time, oh how much I am perturbed by medicine.

I want to post something on my cakeday because I've missed it like most of the 15 years on this site. Caught it within the last hour of the anniversary.

Anyway, I appreciate how much quality and support this subreddit has been over the years and especially during that nightmare of March and April of 2020.

You're good people.
