Title: I was listening to a podcast and it said "Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples please be aware there may be the voices of deceased people "

I'm not really aware of why this is a cultural warning. Does it apply to all things such as tv, films, music etc? Or just factual media like podcasts and documentaries?
