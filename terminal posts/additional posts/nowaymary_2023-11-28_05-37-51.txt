Content:
I have stage 4 metastatic breast cancer, double positive, Mets to lungs, spine and lymph nodes. Diagnosed 6 yrs ago. 
Been relatively stable for a while. Recently found new Mets in hip bone but right now it's just watch closely. 
But 
I've fallen off the path. I can't sleep, I'm in full on anxiety/depressed mode. I really am struggling with daily stuff which is stupid because really nothing has changed
So why is everything so hard? 
Has this happened to anyone else, a sudden fall into a pit that appeared? How do I get out?
