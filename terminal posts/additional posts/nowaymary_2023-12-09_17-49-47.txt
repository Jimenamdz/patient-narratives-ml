So it's the middle of the night here. I was asleep and suddenly I was in a nightmare and woke up heart pounding - why? Because my oldest child got accepted for their first choice uni course and it's a five year double degree. 
I'm soooo proud but realistically I won't see them graduate. And I feel like it's my fault for having this bloody black cloud living in me waiting to fuck with my children's lives.
Like honestly when is a good time to lose your mother? 
I'm so scared for them. When my end comes I will have doctors giving me the good stuff and then I will be dead gone and out of it. Buty children will have to deal with the devastation of their lives as they know it. 
Short version - their father is peripherally involved in their lives HIS choice since long beforey diagnosis. Family live a long plane ride away. They were 7, 9 and 12 when I was diagnosed just over 6 yrs ago
Life expectancy on diagnosis was 5 yrs. Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer double positive

I hate this for them. And now I'm crying. FM stupid cancer ridden L
