I've been feeling like I've slowed right down and making less obvious progress, but still maintaining what I've done. So not zipping ahead but taking small steps forward while maintaining.
We had visitors to the house yesterday who haven't been here since before Xmas. One of the first things that they said was wow your living area looks amazing! Did you paint?
Nope. Just decluttered and kept on with it. 
Apparently the room looks lighter, brighter, bigger and comfy. 
Yay me 
So even if you think you are not getting far, you definitely are way further along than when you started. Sustainable change comes in slow steps.
