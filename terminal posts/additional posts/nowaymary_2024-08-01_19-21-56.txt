Title: It's my Cancer-versary

Content:
Seven years ago I was told I had cancer and my prognosis wasn't good. 
My official diagnosis was explained properly to me on the 7th and the 9th is when I broke my children's childhoods and had to explain to them what was going on.
That was the worst day of my life. 
This year I feel numb about the whole thing. I was initially told life expectancy of 5 years so I've had longer. The side effects of my treatment are absolutely kicking my arse right now and I need to decide if taking a break is worth the risk. 
I can't die right now but quite honestly I'm so tired that I wouldn't mind a coma because at least I would get a proper rest. 
Then I feel guilty for thinking of myself when it's my children who are most important in this whole mess. 
They were 7, 8 and 11 when I had to tell them and my first oncology appointment was on my eldest 's 12th birthday. 
So yeah happy 7 years to me
