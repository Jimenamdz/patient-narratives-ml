Title: How do you be strong when exhausted

I'm exhausted. I have a recurrent side effect that is currently playing hell with me - I'm waiting for the appointment with the relevant other specialist to check if it's just the usual or something new. Meanwhile I'm constantly sore (more so than usual) very tired and run down, and struggling a bit. 
And then my youngest child has been diagnosed with a chronic illness which requires a lot of appointments and help right now, it's a difficult age to be diagnosed and things are difficult for them right now. And I have to be strong for them, not lose my patience with my other children when they say I'm favouring the youngest (kids are 19, 15 and 14, definitely old enough to get illness and hospital appointments trump wanting me to drive them to the shopping centre)
And manage myself plus the house and everything else. 
Their father is absent by his choice. 
I have people who say they will help but honestly what I need is someone to think for a day. 
Things are just hard. Today I took a big painkiller at 1pm and went to bed and sobbed. The dog is a great help but she is 5.5kgs and has no thumbs so limited. 
People say stupid things like I'm so strong re cancer but it's only because they purposely don't look too close to see all the cracks
