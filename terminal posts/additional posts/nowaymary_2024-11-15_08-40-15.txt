Title: I have actually finished a romm

Content:
As in 100%, no little things left to do, everything in its place, clear floor, fully usable and only has what I want to have in it. 
Even better it's my office / craft space. 
It's taken 10 yrs 11 months,  from the time we moved into this house to being actually done. 
I actually cried - partly from the joy and partly from there's still so many rooms left before the house is fully done. 
I sat in there this afternoon and felt comfortable, inspired and relaxed. Which is what the room is supposed to be for.
