Hello, friends! I just this last weekend attended a chöd empowerment offered through a Zoom livestream, and I have a few simple practicality-related questions that I would like to ask the lamas. Essentially, I want to ask about the proper order of the practices. The two organizations hosting the event, Dharmata and the Abhaya Fellowship, understandably don’t have up-front ways of contacting the lamas. 

How would you recommend reaching out to the teachers? Should I include a written request with dana? Reaching out through email or Facebook? I want to be as respectful of their time as possible and avoid imposing on them. If you have any experience with these organizations or teachers, please let me know!

Edit: If you have experience with these teachings and would like to offer advice, please shoot me a PM.
