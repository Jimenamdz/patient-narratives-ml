Title: Reading recommendations on the mahasiddhas

Hello all! 

As I delve more deeply into my tradition, I’ve become more curious to learn about the mahasiddhas from a scholarly or historical perspective. I’m interested the religious climate surrounding the mahasiddhas and the movement they represent: the differences between them and similar groups; how they related to non-ascetic laypeople; major doctrinal developments they developed (realized), that sort of thing. I should add, I’m specifically interested in their relationships to similar theistic groups, like the Shaivite Nath movement. I’ve heard it said that there was considerable overlap between Buddhist/non-Buddhist ascetics during this time period, and I’d like to dig up more about that if possible. 

If you have a reading recommendation, please drop it in the comments or even PM me. My background is in anthropology, so full-on academic sources are encouraged. Thanks!
