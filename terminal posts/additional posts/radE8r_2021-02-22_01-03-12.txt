Title: Reading recommendations about the mahasiddhas

Hello all!

As I delve more deeply into my tradition, I’ve become more curious to learn about the mahasiddhas from an historical perspective. I’m interested the historical religious climate surrounding the mahasiddhas and the movement they represent: the differences between them and similar groups; how they related to non-ascetic laypeople; major doctrinal developments they developed (realized), that sort of thing. I should add, I’m specifically interested in their relationships to similar theistic groups, like the Shaivite Nath movement. I’ve heard it said that there was overlap between Buddhist/non-Buddhist ascetics during this time period, and I’d like to dig up more about that if possible.

I’m currently eyeing titles like *The Alchemical Body* by David Gordon White and *Indian Esoteric Buddhism* by Ronald Davidson. My background is in anthropology, so full-on academic sources are encouraged, but anything you know off the top of your head is useful too. If you have a reading recommendation, please drop it in the comments or even PM me. Thanks!
