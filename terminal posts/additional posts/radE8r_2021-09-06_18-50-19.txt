Title: Connecting with yidams

Does anyone here have advice on strengthening your connection with yidams?

My teacher said something yesterday which motivated me to post. I've received and have been contemplating an extraordinary ngondro for about a year now, and I'm satisfied with how it's going. Something I've been curious about, though, is the relationship with my yidam. I can feel her presence when on the cushion, and have an inkling of devotion for her off the cushion as well. Should I strive to strengthen this feeling of devotion? How would I go about it? Offerings? Remaining in that portion of the sadhana for longer?

Basically, what should I be shooting for? What is the kind of relationship I should cultivate towards the yidam? Is my line of thought here misguided? Is this something I should be thinking about at all? I'm open to any and all advice, be it texts, teachings, or otherwise. Additionally -- as always -- if the answer should be kept private, you can PM me as well.
