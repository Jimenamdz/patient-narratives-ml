Title: Advice on how to identify quality during initial training

Hey all, newbie here. I’ve made contact with a few teachers who belong to the same school/larger organization and I hope to begin classes soon. To my inexperienced eyes, I get a mix of legitimate kung fu and McDojo vibes from their website. The curriculum listed seems developed enough to suggest legitimacy and they have a section dedicated to lineage (the style predates the Cultural Revolution but has been kept in the family until now). On the other hand, it’s suggested that one can work up to a black sash in “at least three years for most skilled people”, and mention is made several times of the opportunity to become a teacher to share these teachings in America.

I live deep in the heart of the Midwest, so I my choices aren’t necessarily abounding, but I feel that their instruction will be legitimate *enough* that I can at least get a good basis for further training if the opportunity presents itself down the road. The main question I’m asking is this: how can I identify quality in kung fu training? What are the signs of legitimacy in curriculum and training?

If anyone has heard of them , it’s the American-Chinese Martial Arts Federation, which teaches 8-step Praying Mantis style. I’d like to add, I mean absolutely no disrespect to any here who practice this style or are a part of the organization, I’d just like to understand how to evaluate quality in kung fu training.

The school’s website can be found here: https://8step.com/curriculum-overview/

EDIT: fixed a word.
