Hey all! I posted a few weeks ago, and I was pleased to have recieved a lot of reassuring responses about the legitimacy of my local kwoon. I figured I'd give you guys a little update.

The school seems legitimate, and the teachers do too. There are no "overweight middle-aged guys" handing out blackbelts for a quick buck. Heck, I haven't seen anyone wearing a belt at all! The sifus explained that fitness requirements are part of advancement between sashes, and they practice what they preach. They do the aerobics with us during warm-ups. Even more promising, they come across as experienced in the teaching aspect of kung fu instruction. I mean that they're more than just advanced students -- they've been taught how to teach. Even outside of all y'all's advice, these are good signs that the school produces well-trained, authentic instructtors. I'm looking forward to learning under their guidance.

I also wanted to share an achievement: I can straight-leg kick up to a 90-degree angle! It's not much, I know, but its a sign that I'm making progress and that training is working. I've historically been very inflexible, so seeing any change at all is heartening. Every time I train, the jumping jacks are easier, my bow stance is steadier, and my bodily control is smoother and quicker. For the first time in my life, I'm loving being active. I'm really enjoying learning kung fu, and looking forward to hanging out here while I do. See y'all around!
