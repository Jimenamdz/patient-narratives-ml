Title: Unwanted notifications help

Hi all! I’ve been receiving unwanted course reminder notifications daily for over two years. I’ve tried changing notification settings, unsubscribing and removing the courses from my course list, and I think I even deleted and reinstalled the app. But still, at 11AM each day, the app reminds me to play the next installment of the courses — which I decided weren’t for me long ago. Has anyone had this experience? Can anyone help? The ‘Contact Us’ button on the support page doesn’t seem to do anything either. 

Thanks!

EDIT: I am using the IOS app.
