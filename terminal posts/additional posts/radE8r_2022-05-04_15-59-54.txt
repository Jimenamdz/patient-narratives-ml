Title: Americans: Go to the protests.

For the Americans here, if you aren't already planning to go protest, please reconsider. ~~Their argument is that the~~ *~~reasoning~~* ~~behind Roe v. Wade is flawed, and they went out of their way to explicitly mention Obergefell v. Hodges (marriage equality) and a handful of other cases which depend on the same reasoning.~~  This is not entirely correct, see the edit below.

Even if you can't get pregnant, show up for people who can. Lend your voice loudly to the commotion. This could very quickly become a "and then they came for" kind of thing.

Even if protesting doesn't help with this particular issue, you will make more connections and friends in the movement. Invest in the community. We will need it if we're going to weather the next few years.

EDIT: Some commenters kindly pointed out my mistake in the above paragraphs. I misread what my research had turned up, and I apologize. I posted the relevant selections in a comment below, but I will put them here too. 

From the opinion draft:

>None of the other decisions cited by *Roe* and *Casey* \[i.e., Obergefell v. Hodges and others\] involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in anyway. \[pp. 32, clarifications mine\]

and:

>And to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. \[pp. 62\]

All that said, please still show up for the protests and make it clear that the Court's rolling back of rights will not be tolerated. The isn't necessarily beholden to us in the way Congress is, but that doesn't mean making a lot of protest hurts anything either. Remember, Stonewall only worked because people backed Marsha up.
