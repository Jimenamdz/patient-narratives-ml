Title: Outdoor shrine requirements

My living situation has become such that I shouldn't really keep a shrine indoors anymore. My plan is to set up an outdoor shrine (we live on an acreage and have plenty of lovely shaded spots in our grove). I've searched on the sub, and besides from a few posts saying outdoor shrines are common in Asia, there aren't really guidelines given.  


I know the statue should be raised above the ground, but does it need to be covered or have a roof or something over its head? Should I face it a particular direction? Any other tips or suggestions are welcome too.
