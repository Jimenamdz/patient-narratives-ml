New doom enthusiast. I got into OM from the trance/raga side and don't listen to a lot of other metal, but they're my all-time favorite and I'm going to go see them in a few months. I've never been to one of their shows or even a metal show at all, so figured I'd ask here. 

Honest question: what are the shows like? I know they give an awesome performance, but what's the vibe? Are people up and moving around, or is it a muted, navel-gazing energy? Should I dress up like Burning Man?
