I've completed the game a few of times and loved each time. It's always a great ride, but this playthrough it's seeming a little easy to me. It's not a Bethesda title, so I can't just increase the 'difficulty' slider. What can I do to make it more challenging? What have you done? Do people do specific runs of the game to make it more fun?
