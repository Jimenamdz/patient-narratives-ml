Title: What can I do to make my PVC mat less slippery?

I need a little more cushion than the standard 3mm Gaiam bangers you find at Walmart but a cushy 3/4" mat makes keeping a solid base tricky. I went to Target and got a 5mm mat (All-In-Motion Premium, [here](https://www.target.com/p/two-tone-yoga-mat-5mm-navy-blue-light-blue-all-in-motion-8482/-/A-82721437#lnk=sametab)).

What I like about it is that the top is a firmer plastic that feels almost like woven jute. It allows for a more solid base and provides the perfect amount of cushion for me. However, as soon as my skin touches it I feel a little perspiration and I start to slip and slide around. It's so bad I can't even do downward dog: I have to fire my core muscles to maintain anything like the proper shape.

Does anyone have experience with this mat, or suggestions for grippier similar ones? Can I do anything to increase the grip of the surface? Buff it down with sand or hot-water-wash off a protective coating? I like the firmness and feel, but don't want to build up incorrect muscle habits.

Thanks!
