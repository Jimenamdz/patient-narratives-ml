I'm in pain, and it fucking sucks, you guys. 

They took me off treatment for an extra week to radiate an honestly inconsequential tumor. While I was off treatment, the tumor in my spine started growing. It's pushing on my spinal cord and practically tap dancing on my femoral nerve. So my leg hurts. A lot. 

But what really really pisses me off is that I can't sit on my comfy cushion to meditate. The angle and the pressure on my back and thigh makes the nerve pain in my leg absolutely sing. Cold fire from knee to hip. It makes concentrating difficult, much less finding any peace. 

And I'm so mad cause meditation is the most important thing I do in a day. I have all this freetime to dedicate myself towards the spiritual practice that gives my life meaning, but I can't put it in practice for longer than 7 minutes at a time.

Sometimes it feels like I'm cursed. It feels like god or whatever is singling me out. Like as soon as I find a source of joy or meaning, this fucking cancer finds a way to get in its way. After diagnosis, I spent three years un-/sub-consciously fearing my body. Because of yoga and meditation, I started loving it again. And then this shit comes up and makes me start hating it all over again. 

I'm not tired. I'm just pissed. I'm normally a happy person, and that's the biggest casualty of my cancer. I can have good and happy days, but it takes so much goddamn work. I just wanna wake up and drink my coffee. I just wanna cultivate a little peace in the time I have left.
