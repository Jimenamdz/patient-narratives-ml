Title: Am I the only one who thinks Herbert wrote it... wrong?

I just finished the first book and while I really enjoyed it, I'm left feeling like the story petered out in the last hundred pages. Really, I felt that the entire "Part Three: The Prophet" was disappointing, and I think it's cause Herbert didn't write the story I was expecting.

I'll try to avoid spoilers, but the ending of the first novel makes it almost an entirely political story. Aside from the unique political power of his station as Muad'dib, Paul's alliance with the Fremen -- his journey of *becoming* Fremen -- is basically irrelevant to how he resolves the conflict of the book. He could have achieved a similar result through any other kind of political arrangement with the Fremen, prophetical powers notwithstanding. 

I guess it's just puzzling to me that Herbert skipped over what I would consider the most interesting parts: Fremen culture and religious life. Things like the mysteries of the Makers, the wisdom gleaned from the hard balance of life in the desert, what it means to be a part of that environment (ecologically as well as spiritually). It just seems like Herbert teed-up all this fascinating stuff and then skipped it. Literally skipped it: Paul's entrance into Fremen culture is breezed over in a timeskip.

Maybe I just got the wrong impression from how the franchise is being marketed. I tend to gravitate towards science fiction/fantasy that has spiritual themes and undertones, and I thought *Dune* was the holy grail. I know the story Herbert tells is far from over and that there are a lot of books, but is there more of what I'm looking for in later books? I can appreciate a certain depth of worldbuilding, but if I'm looking for a story about culture and religion that goes beyond just their significance in politics, will I be rewarded by reading more of the *Dune* universe?
