Content:
Is there anyone here from the Upper Midwest? I'm interested in learning sitar and am going through the process of finding someone to teach me to play. I'm open to online classes (already checked out the sub's wiki) but I'd like to try to find an in-person teacher if possible -- particularly since I'm not super experienced with stringed instrument set-up and repair. I do not yet own one, but would like to.

If you know of teachers or players in the upper midwest, please comment or message me so we can get in touch.
