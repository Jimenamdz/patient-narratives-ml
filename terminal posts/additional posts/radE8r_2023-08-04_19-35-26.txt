Zen lurker here. I've been playing with introducing chant into my practice and have been wanting to memorize the Heart Sutra, which in turn, has me curious about the contexts where its mantra is used. 

Most other mantras are associated with a specific deity, (Avalokiteshvara, Guru Rinpoche, Tara, etc.) and chanting the mantra establishes a connection between you and the deity. But the Heart Sutra mantra isn't connected to a specific deity AFAIK -- unless everybody has been ignoring [Yum Chenmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajnaparamita) for a long time. 

So what does the Heart Sutra's mantra do? Why and when do people use it?
