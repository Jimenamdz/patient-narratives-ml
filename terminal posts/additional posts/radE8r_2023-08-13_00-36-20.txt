Title: Folks with spinal injuries -- advice? Experience?

Bit of an odd question here: has anyone had yoga help with spinal cord compression? Will my slightly weaker right leg be stabilized and strengthened with time?

I've got cancer, with some metastases in my spine. One of them appears to be ever-so-slightly pressing on my spinal cord, enough so that I've got a mild case of nerve pain. So far I haven't noticed any loss of function with my leg, but when I'm on the mat -- particularly towards the end of the practice -- I notice the affected leg is a little weaker. I have more shake compared to the other side, and I can't hold a given position quite as long.

Does anyone have any experience with neurological issues like weakness improving? Any advice? I'm hoping that the strength and body-integration can even out the imbalance between my two legs.
