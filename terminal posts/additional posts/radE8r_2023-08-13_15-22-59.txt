Title: How does enlightenment end suffering?

So as far as I can grasp, entirety of the Path is to punch through to emptiness and see your true nature, then practice deepening and living in that mindstate until you become a buddha. But what exactly is the mechanism by which that eliminates suffering? Is it just that when you're awake to reality (emptiness), you don't identify with the things that made you suffer before? Or that you have the freedom to choose not to?

Edit to add: This is all rather abstract. But how can zazen and its insight end my suffering in this life too?
