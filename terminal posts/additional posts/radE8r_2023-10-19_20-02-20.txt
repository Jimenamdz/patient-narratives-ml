Title: What do I need to learn?

So I'm new to wheelchair life. I have cancer with mets in the spine, and earlier this month one of them paralyzed me from the waist down. A week in the hospital, a very stressful plane flight, and what feels like a hundred diaper changes later, I'm at home adjusting and learning to live using a chair. Despite my despair at the beginning, I'm beginning to live quite well and starting to enjoy my life again.

I hope my frustration doesn't offend anybody. I'm still very much adjusting. But that leads me to my reason for posting: there's so much I don't know, and so much I want to learn. Stuff like: how do I position my legs to minimize pressure on my feet during car rides? What do I say to my PCP to get them to prescribe a better chair? What is a better chair and how do I know it? How do I find resources in my community and connect with other chair users? And how do I carry a damn cup of coffee from the counter to the table?

There are a million other questions I haven't even thought of yet. I'm a newbie and though I'm starting to feel less overwhelmed, there's still just so much I don't know. I want to maximize my independence and lighten the load on my folks, my primary caregivers. What do I need to learn? 

Thanks for reading!
