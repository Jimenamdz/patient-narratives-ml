Title: Perks for disability?

As I lay awake at odd hours of the night, it occurs to me to ask: what are some lesser-known perks available to us disabled folks? 

I was dreaming of better delivery service… memberships? that we should have access to because getting around is harder for a lot of us. Like cheaper rates for first class mail, both in and out, that sort of thing. If it exists. 

Drop your little-known-facts, please!

Edit: Lest some folks misunderstand, I’m asking about things like discounts and free passes. I’m not saying that disability is easy, nor am I equating perks with the basic accommodations we should be entitled to. I’m just asking about discounts, etc.
