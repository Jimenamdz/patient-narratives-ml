Title: Sphincter spasms — anyone else?

On bad days, my anus cramps uncomfortably, and it makes it hard to do anything. Does anyone have experience with this? I can’t seem to figure out why it happens, and I’m having trouble controlling them. I’m an L2 incomplete wheelchair user. 

I have the cramps worst on the day we need to change my pain patch, to the point where I just assume it’s going to be a bad day with pain. I’ve tried a lot of different kinds of drugs: muscle relaxers, anti-anxieties, painkillers, etc. So far nothing has controlled the spasms. What do I do to stop them?
