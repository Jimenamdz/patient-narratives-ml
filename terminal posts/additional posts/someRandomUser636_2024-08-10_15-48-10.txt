imagine being born in the 80s... not in the US... in a working class family were money was not much... just enough... toys for the kids were not a priority... every toy I wanted was a big NO.. robots, GI JOEs... HE-MAN, TMNTs... and I keep counting... dont get me started on vehicles and legos... specially when I saw the imported ones... the best I got was a GIJOE plane and one time a LEGo robot... but I remember myself glued to the toystore glass looking the cool toys... the barbie universe for boys... time went by... I did well.. I do what I love and get paid for it... I got an ender 3 v2 back in 2022 and like everyone .. printed a all the typical free models around.. and then I found it... a [ROBOTECH](https://www.printables.com/model/21211-robotech-vf1-and-battleoid/comments) VF1 model.. TRANSFORMBLE !! and .... LUCKY13... I was like "WOWWWW".. then... EASY13... then... [TOYMKR3D](https://www.toymakr3d.com/) and his awesome robots...  now [DUMMY13](https://makerworld.com/en/@user_2064502572/collections/1776686) and the awesome remixes for custom armor and accesories... and of course the huge amount of articulated action figures out there... I did the spiderman from [3DZipGuy](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/spider-armor-complete)... It was like my inner child's revenge on life... I also did some paint and even got an airbrush... Im so happy with this awsome hobby... and while some on my house say I have an adiciton problem (I keep buying filament) and I need to get a proper place to put all my stuff... I cannot be happier... Im so thanksfull for all those amazing designers out there .. now.. I... own the toystore.

PS: I even did some actual practical prints too!
