I’ve known this person for more than three decades. We’ve been through a lot together—both good and bad. I’ve witnessed several of his downfalls, and he’s often been called selfish by nearly every partner. I saw him hit rock bottom. The family context is complex, but now that I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD in 2024, I see things a bit differently.

We talked about the changes, and he also has ADHD (he’s currently undergoing treatment for another neurological disorder that had a huge impact on him in the past). I’ve taken some of his words to heart—his justifications for certain actions—and I realize he might not see that he’s falling into the same patterns. He tries to do his best for everyone, making decisions that affect others while assuming everyone will be okay with it because the people involved get along. But when things go wrong, he becomes overwhelmed with guilt and anger. He feels like everyone is against him.

I think he’s masking the fact that he’s doing what’s easiest for him, trying to please everyone. I told him that good intentions still have consequences, and facing them is part of the process. It’s important to put yourself in others' shoes *beforehand* to avoid these situations. Not everyone—no matter how cool they are—sees things the way he does. It’s frustrating to hear him complain, and it’s hard for me to tell him that he’s also responsible. It’s not just that the world is unfair and that he’s always the victim.
