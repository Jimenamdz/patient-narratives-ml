so... now that I'm facing this new way of thinking about things... meds... counseling... there is a lot of GOOD in what I'm learning... but also a lot of BAD... confronting the YOU that you building across multiple decades... knowing that many patterns were just defense mechanisms... unraveling all that and learning new ways... especially in a relationship is not easy... now I, for once understand.. or at least I'm starting to.. truly know when I was told thing like "I'm not your mom" or "you don't see me".. or "you only think of you".. and the classic "you are lazy and only do things YOU like.. everything else you don't do until you have no choice".. also "don't justify everything you do is somehow for me... take responsibility".. etc etc etc... now that we know what is going on we are on a process where I'm starting late and from the other end there is no much rope left... in addition.. starting expressing myself is awful... sometimes my own words work against me and cause more pain... "so you are afraid of me?" .. "I cause you to be on alert against me??".. and I can go on.. and even when I try to spend some time thinking the words.. maybe to chat over it later.. then when I say "That is not what I meant... is not that I feel like that 24x7".. is like ... Is me against me... and Im carrying everyone I love with me on this try and error exercise...and I hate it.... we love each other... but this process is killing us...   by the way.. she is also doing a lot since the diagnosis to accommodate... I'm aware that we are both doing the work... I know for a fact that my happiness is her top priority and me saying that I'm not happy.. after all the effort... destroy everything and everyone..
