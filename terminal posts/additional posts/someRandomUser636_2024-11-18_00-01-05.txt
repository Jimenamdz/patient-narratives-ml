I recently upgraded to lineal rails but I notice that I dont have a proper direct drive mount for this one... I have the minimus cooling part, the BMG dual drive extruder and I added a mount for the DD that was great but cant find any proper mount now... I will have to go back to bowden until I can find one... if anyone know if any model I can use I would appreciate the pointer.

  
Thanks!
