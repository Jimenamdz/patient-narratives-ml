Title: Profile calibrations pointers..

Content:
This is AFTER I setup the filament profile... I have the default 0.12, 0.16, 0.20 and 0.24 profiles... I usually work on 0.20 but wanted to know if there is any guide (specific to orca maybe) on how to tune speed, bridges, any any other little thing so I can have like a profiles for specific type of models... I assume that the settings for a huge box with almost no details should not apply to a 10cm tall warrior model with details... but not sure HOW to tune that... any pointers?... My endgoal is to have teh default profile and one for fine detailed models and another one for big and mode funnctional part type of model...
