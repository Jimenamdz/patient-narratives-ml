I recently got the Skr mini e3 v3 for my ender 3 v2 and while working on it I found a video talking about the G34 command for z alignment and since I have dual Z I thought that was the purpose of the 2 ports for Z but no... single as I confirmed... the board have a single driver for Z... so... can someone explain the purpose for 2 ports for Z axis in this board? Now Im still on the splitter cable feeding both z stepper motors..
