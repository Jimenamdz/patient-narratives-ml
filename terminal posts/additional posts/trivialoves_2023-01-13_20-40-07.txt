hi again, actual good news this time lol - they moved my surgery up to january 30th!

since the last time I got a THR at this hospital they got the mako stryker robot. they said it's going to assist in what the surgeon does, I'll get a CT scan sometime soon and they'll use the robot to make everything a bit more precise for hopefully an easier recovery/better results, though my last THR (2020) has been good so far - I did have a harsh recovery but I finished chemo the month before that so not surprising. that was posterior otherwise normal THR no robot

just wondering if anyone has any recovery experience with this kind, how easy was it? I'm 24 and I guess average health. not really looking to be discouraged from this route or anything because I do trust this surgeon and just want it done asap, but ik people here usually have things to share, I've read a lot of stories about posterior in general but idk if anyone has had the robotic and thinks that made a significant difference. thanks!
