I asked The Question again today not really expecting a very specific answer and my doctor told me he thinks there's like a 1 in 3 chance mine comes back in like the next ten years at this point since I've been lucky enough to not have it back yet. I started sobbing in the car tbh and my mom was like what are you all upset about. I said what do you think?? And she went "but you already knew it was like this."

thanks, yes I knew it was bad 4 years ago but it still sucks and it's like it ruined my life or at least my 20s and now I'm supposed to be happy that I maybe won't die til I'm like 35. I get to stress about moving out of my parents place and getting a job (all very socially late lol) just in time to lose it. I feel so alone in this it's like it physically hurts sometimes.

side note - does anyone else constantly get told by nurses "omg, you've been through so much!!" along with the shocked and sad faces and pity... I don't necessarily find it offensive because I realize they're trying to be empathetic but I feel so frustrated with this disconnect - this oncology nurse spends five minutes gasping about how pitiful my life is and then everyone around me irl won't even ask me if I'm okay. idek
