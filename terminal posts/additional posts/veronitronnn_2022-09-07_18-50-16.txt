I don't see much posted here about this, but we are experiencing it and it is rough! 

My son just turned 1 over the weekend and for the past month, he's gone from a very happy baby to a toddler that does nothing but cry and whine. He used to go to bed very easy and now he cries for 5-15 minutes before he falls asleep. It breaks my heart but I know going in the bedroom while he's crying won't help things. He wakes up fussy, hates diaper changes and getting dressed/undressed, and wants nothing else in this world but for me to hold him. The best part is, he only appears to behave this way when he's home with mom and dad. Otherwise he is his normal happy self. 

I'm sure it's all just a phase, but knowing that doesn't make it any easier!
