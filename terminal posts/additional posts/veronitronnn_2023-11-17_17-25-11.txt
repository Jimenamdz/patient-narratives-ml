Title: How many gnats are too many?

I'm a new-ish plant enthusiast. I have about 25 plants I've collected over the last 7 months. Lately I have been fighting fungus gnats and I've been trying everything to get rid of them but they keep showing up. It's not a lot... After a couple days there might be 5 gnats on one trap and just a couple on another trap. Now I'm starting to wonder if I'm delusional. Is it unrealistic to expect to have no gnats? ðŸ˜‚
