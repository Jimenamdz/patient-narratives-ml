I got this plant several months ago at Home Depot. It was labeled as a peperomia, but I haven't been able to find a similar plant online. It started off as 3 stalks but some have branched off. It soooooorta looks like a mini version of my big marble peperomia I have at home but I'm not convinced. Thank you!
