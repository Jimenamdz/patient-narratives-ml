So l was right about the whole "This treatment is going to kill me" thing. Saturday night I vomited blood. And I don't mean "Oh is that a spot of blood I view?" No. Full blown thick black coffee grounds blood. 

Came in to the hospital and they did a CT Scan to check my soft tissue for damage. They found a blood clot in my right jugular artery. 

Immediately admitted and slapped on heprin. I live here bow, at the hospital, until further notice. Honestly? I couldn't be more okay with this. I'm getting the care I need, I'm getting the support I need, and I'm finally able to do more than sob in bed. 

Never thought I'd say it, but, this hospital stay saved my life and I couldn't be nore thankful.
