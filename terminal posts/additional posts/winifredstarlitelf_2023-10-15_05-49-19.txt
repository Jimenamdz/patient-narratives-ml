I'm not sleeping much or well. The nightmares are stupid, but they're legit fears that I don't know how to deal with it. 

I keep dreaming g that the cancer comes back. I haven't even had my first post treatment PET scan. Thats in November. 

I had a breakdown in the bathtub. I lost 60 lbs in two months and now i have loose skin and my stretch marks are more pronounced. Used to be i couldnt look in the mirror because I saw myself as too big (I was 260 lbs in March before I was diagnosed.)

Now I just see my scars and this fairly smaller version of myself. Where did I go? When will it go away, the self loathing?
