Title: Nausea is KICKING MY A**

I'm 14 weeks pregnant tomorrow. I have HG and have been hospitalized twice during my pregnancy and had to go to the ER every other week for fluids and treatment for dehydration. 

It's been 2 weeks since I was last hospitalized and I've been able to keep down white rice and broth and ice water. I'm still horrifically nauseous but no vomiting since hospitalization. I had to stop taking the Zofran because I'm so constipated. The Unisome and B6 combo have kept me from vomiting, but I'm no longer able to sleep and I'm so uncomfortable. 

I'm scared that the white rice/broth diet is bad for baby because while I know there's some nutrients in the broth and very little in the rice, I can't keep down fruit or veggies and meat is a giant no right now because of how sick it's made me. My OB hasn't said much, just has encouraged me to keep trying to eat. 

I feel so guilty and depressed because everyone is saying I need more fruits and veg, but I can't even keep down my prenatal. I had to stop taking it the day after I got home from the hospital because it triggered immediate vomiting. I feel like a terrible mom already. 

I guess I was wondering if this minimal diet of broth/rice will cause harm to my baby. Anyone else have this issue too?
