Title: Temporary Leave for HG complications?

I'm 34w1d and I've missed three weeks of work since I can't stay at my desk for more than 10 minutes without running to the bathroom to vomit. 

My boss said I was currently useless and that I should just stay home. I have 3x weekly appointments with my OB and high risk MFS and 2x weekly IV infusions to keep me hydrated. HR suggested I take a leave of absence from work so I could rest and take care of myself and the baby until I give birth. 

Has anyone else had to go through this? My husband is constantly worried about me and I feel like I'm failing him while he's busting his ass working and I'm just trapped in bed or at the doctor. 

I need this kid out already. I'm barely functioning.
