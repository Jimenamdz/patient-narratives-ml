Title: Update On Leave and HG

I previously posted that I had been suffering at work and was stressed about possibly taking leave. Whelp...it happened. 

I fainted at home getting underwear on after a shower. I had an appointment THAT DAY and my OB went "Yep. Medical leave is necessary. No more work for you, mama."

It's not paid and I don't qualify for STD or FMLA but due to my good record and relationship with HR they accepted my leave and said they can't wait to have me back as soon as I was ready and that they can't wait for me to have my baby because they know how miserable this pregnancy has been for me and that I deserve to eat a whole pizza by myself. (My HR manager is an angel, honestly. Such a sweet woman.)

Today was a bad day. HG was in full swing, I've been days without being able to keep down my anti anxiety meds, and I got several reminders for bills coming out of my very nearly empty bank account. 

Needless to say, while I'm glad to be on leave and get to rest, the stress I felt today was in no way good for me or the baby. DH and I are going to figure things out (we always do) but, damn it, if the anxiety didn't kick my ass which led to 30 minutes of dry heaving and a crying jag that completely wore me out. 

5 1/2 more weeks at least.
