My water broke on Tuesday at 1:21am. I was 36w4d. All I could do was think "Oh my god....its almost over." 

I had an emergency C Section and as soon as my placenta was pulled from my body the nausea was GONE. I held my baby and sobbed. He was beautiful and strong and I no longer felt nauseous. It was all finally done with. 

I have PTSD though and taking a bite of anything that isn't a safe food sent me spiraling into the fear of throwing up. My baby is strong and hilarious and I am super proud of the fact that he is healthy and beautifully developed. I'm a mess though. But it's over. It's finally over. 

The end is close and I swear it's worth it, but it's not as easy as just being happy it's gone. There are side affects. I'm proud of all of us. We are survivors and so are our babies. Be kind to yourselves. Knkw you are not alone.
