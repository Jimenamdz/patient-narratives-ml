My LO is 8 weeks old on Tuesday and is an extreme velcro baby. He will scream himself purple if I put him in his bassinett, even if I'm touching him. My husband was forced to go back to work 4 weeks ago and In the almost 4 weeks since I've had maybe 3 hours of sleep a night. I'll get three hours and be awake for 18-36 hours. DH does his best but he gets baby down for a few hours before baby is screaming at him, fussing and crying until he is back in my arms. 

I'm exhausted. I've had a migraine for a week and a half. I've lost weight, my hair is falling out, and I'm having those weird auditory hallucinations where I think my baby is crying and he isn't even here. 

My inlaws take him once a week overnight (they live right next door) and it's a massive help. LO fussed for a bit but both inlaws have gotten him to calm down well enough that they can put him in his pack and play to sleep. I slept with his crib sheet for a few days before they put it in and we even recorded my heartbeat for his white noise. He's such an amazing baby and I love him with all my heart, I'm just exhausted. 

I know it will get easier. I know it will get better. I'm just battling my PPD and PPA the best I can while also struggling to live with so little sleep. I go back to work on the 30th and I have no clue how I'm going to function. My doctor is working with us to make sure we have plans in place for when that happens. 

I just want to sleep for a week.
