Hello - My grandmother was diagnosed just this week with stage 4 lung cancer. The mass is over 7 cm in the right lung. It has completely cut off the right lung. The pulmonologist doesn't recommend surgery as it has spread in many places. So far we have found mets in the spine pelvis brain adrenal glands and a large mass in the liver. The oncologist did not recommend radiation for the brain mets. They took a biopsy of the liver and sent us home awaiting the results. She was independent up until this point. Luckily she already lives with me and my husband. But now she needs assistance standing, walking, going to the bathroom, cooking her meals, doing laundry etc. She is flipping back and forth between understanding how serious her condition is and insisting that she has to do things alone to recover. She is definitely too weak to handle what I understand chemo would be for her. I know we won't know what can be done until the biopsy results but the appointment is in three weeks and the initial estimate for her is only living 4-8 weeks. I guess I am just looking for what to expect and how to help her understand what's happening.
