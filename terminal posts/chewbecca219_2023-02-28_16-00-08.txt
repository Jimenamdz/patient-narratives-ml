So I was diagnosed stage 1b, triple positive in May 2021. Did TCHP, lumpectomy and had some lymph nodes removed (tested positive there too). Got NED November 2021. Radiation till feb 22 then continued HP until June 2022. 
Went to ER with headaches on Sunday and found a brain tumor. Neuro said it is likely breast cancer. Only one mass, body CT is clear. (Had clean brain MRI 6 months ago!)
My pride hates being treatable, not curable. I refuse to google. I know Iâ€™m terminal but I want to be here and live as long as I can, even if I have to chase this for 30 years. 
Please tell me something good. I get the tumor removed tomorrow, then do brain radiation, then likely more chemo. Just tell me something good.
