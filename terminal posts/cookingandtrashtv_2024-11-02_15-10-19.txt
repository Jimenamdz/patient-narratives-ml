38f and my 39m  were talking and he mentioned to me that he has had some clots and bleeding and he told his PCP a year ago and he told him it’s probably he was taking too many NSAIDs and he has hemorrhoids. He finally told me too 2 weeks ago and I told him he needs to get in to a colonoscopy asap. I thought polyps, possibly negative with needing egd and an ulcer or something but not this. 

I am PA in neurosurgery and we deal with brain cancers but only a few are terminal. I got him in for a colonoscopy and when the report was complete I was horrified. Likely malignant 5cm tumor. I got him for CT abdomen and pelvis and my colleague in colorectal surgery same day and there are 50 lesions in his liver. We think he has about 2 years and he will start chemo asap. 

I’m so devastated I can’t sleep or eat. We have 4 kids. I know he feels worse. I don’t know what to say? I do t know what to even say. I can’t stop crying and I can’t use him for “support” duh but how is any of this fair? His daughter he has full custody of bc mom is a drug addict. I have 3 of my own that are around same age. 

I know he’s going to die. How can anyone cope with this and what’s to come? 39. wtf and I’m in medical field so I know the outcomes. If he responds maybe more. What if it’s less. What if he has Mets to lungs and brain. Need a PET scan. This is so unfair. I don’t know what to think or do. What do I do?
