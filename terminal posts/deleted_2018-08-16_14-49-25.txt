Hi all

Today was the day I found out I am going to die of cancer. I knew I had the disease before, I also knew it had spread from my oesophagus to my lung and I was aware that I was in a sticky situation in the first place but I'd been holding out hope that they'd find a surgeon willing to do the operation I need to survive.

All my referrals are done. No one will do it. I have cancer that surgery can't cure.

It could be 6 months, it could be 5 years. However long it is, I'm going to die.

Fuck.

I've subbed and added this place to my favourites, if anyone wants to chat then I'll be all ears.
