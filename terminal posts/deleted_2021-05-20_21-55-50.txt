Title: I will never have children in my life

I (m28) have a terminal high grade sarcoma, highly aggressive, spread to bones and lungs and other organs (even tho chemo got my lungs free), but my time is limited. I probably will never get married, build a house, plant a tree or have children. Even if it could be physically possible to have children after chemo and radiation, it would not be fair to throw them into a world without a father. And this just sucks, my sister is infertile and the family line will end with us two. 

The most time I'm aware of these facts and can handle them, but sometimes I just break down and sink into the darkness of these thoughts. They overwhelm me and I can't do anything about it. 

Who knows if I even get to know someone new who could handle my cancer and that I'm going to die. Who would get into a relationship with a terminal ill wreck. Sexuality aside, but should I sit here, knowing that I will never feel intimacy or human closeness of a partner with whom I can share my pain? 

It's so hard, I'm sorry for this vent, sometimes my mind is going crazy over this fucking cancer.
