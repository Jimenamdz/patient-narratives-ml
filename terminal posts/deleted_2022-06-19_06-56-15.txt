*****UPDATE*****


I have just had a meeting with my oncologist to discuss the biopsy results of my colonoscopy. It is now truly confirmed to be exactly what they had informed me it was likely to be. However, they have also informed me that the genomic testing of the biopsy has revealed what sub set it is. Which sadly is quite an aggressive type. 

My initial time frame (given very roughly with no certainty) was around 4-5 years providing treatment is successful. Well, it has now been changed to 2 years maximum providing treatment goes perfectly. More like to be 12-18 months. 

Thanks for all the kind words and responses from everyone.

Hi Everyone,

&#x200B;

I am a 32 yr old male that is reasonably fit, reasonably healthy, and have had absolutely no symptons before.

&#x200B;

I have just had my diagnosis of Advanced Metastatic Colon Cancer.

&#x200B;

It started low in my colon and has spread to a destructive lesion in my pubic bone, 8 growths in my liver, 3 on my left kidney and many many smaller growths in my lymph nodes.

&#x200B;

The point of making this post is just to get it off my chest to people that have either experienced it, or have family members that have. Without being a damn Doctor, of which I have had far more than enough of in the last 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

Here is my story.

&#x200B;

About a month ago I started getting pain in my left hip, I went to see my local GP who gave me anti inflammatories and asked me to report back in a week.

&#x200B;

A week later it had gotten worse rather than improved, so he referred me over to get an xray and an ultrasound done of the area. They came back inconclusive.

&#x200B;

The next step was an MRI of the area, which did happily reveal that the prognosis he had suggested was correct (a labral tear on the femur) however it also incidentally found a destructive lesion in the pubic bone.

&#x200B;

This set off a whirlwind of blood tests and other test after a second opinion (my partner is an oncologist who forwarded the results to her consultant to get her opinion). The testing required was a full blood work up with cancer markers included as well as a full body CT scan.

&#x200B;

The blood work came back as completely normal except for my CA 19-9 cancer marker, normal is less than 40, mine returned with a result of 1880.

&#x200B;

The CT scan revealed multiple growth in different areas, confirming that it had spread and that I would need a PET scan to get more definitive answers.

&#x200B;

I was then fast tracked through the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre which is where my partner is currently working. They organised a PET scan to happen within a few days. I was also allowed to see the results about 10 minutes after the scan was concluded.

&#x200B;

I was lit up like a christmas tree showing all the growths.

&#x200B;

I have since spent 5 days in hospital in a pain crisis due to the lesion in my pubic bone having weakened the bone enough for it to fracture. (which just btw, seriously sucks) Whilst I was in the hospital they have also now done a Colonoscopy to get tissue samples of the Primary tumour in my colon.

&#x200B;

Currently that is all I know, but the conversation with my oncologist have confirmed this to be a terminal case, and that systemic treatment is the only option, which will only allow a small extension of life.

&#x200B;

I hate it all, my life was finally going in the right direction, I am successfully running a small business with one of my younger brothers. We are just about finishing our second full financial year and are expected to hit out first major milestone of 500k turnover.

&#x200B;

I was also intending to ask my partner to marry me in a few months.

&#x200B;

We were looking at houses to buy, and are working on our first child (she has reproductive issues, so we are pursuing IVF). Everything seemed to be going so well, I guess I can't be too surprised that the universe decided to slap me back down to reality.

&#x200B;

Well, that's all I have to say right now, I just wanted to hear some other peoples opinions on everything, and to maybe get a little support in this ridiculous time of my life.

&#x200B;

Cheers
