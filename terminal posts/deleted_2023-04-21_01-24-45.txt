I had to put my cat down today.  What we’d thought was arthritis turned out to be osteosarcoma, and by the time the vet realized *that*, it had spread too far.  When he broke the news, the vet gave a hard sale on how the cat would have no quality of life and would be in immense pain for however longer he lived, and said the most humane thing to do was to put him down.

I stood there and took it in, not saying anything about my own diagnosis—pancreatic adenocarcinoma, for sure spread to my lungs and I’ll be shocked if it’s not also in my stomach or liver too by now—and agreed with him.  And as the shot did its work my cat put his paw on my fingers like he always did and closed his eyes for the last time.  And as sad as I was, I also felt jealous for just a moment that they’ll let you put a *pet* to sleep if they’re sick enough, but a terminal patient choosing to leave on their own terms is de facto illegal and if anyone ever catches you trying they’ll *keep you alive* out of spite.  (They’ll also *tell* you how much your cat’s vet bill is going to be, but they’ll never tell *you* how much *your* treatment costs.)

And then I had to race across town to pick my kid up from school because my Spouse changed their mind and said they’d rather not.  Because I don’t even get to have that option even if it were legal, because I’m the only one who gives a shit that anyone else in my family eats or bathes.

And yes, I know I just posted about a damn cat’s cancer.  I am aware of that.  More than one type of mammal is allowed to have cancer.  Cancer patients are allowed to have pets.  If any of that is something you want to report me for, go ahead and do that and block me as well.

I have no idea how much longer I have left before I’ll have to stop working.  I have no idea how long before some growth in me finally squeezes an artery shut or bursts one open, or a coughing fit lasts so long I end up passing out.  Maybe I’ll be lucky and die in my sleep before the pain *really* sets in.  Maybe I’ll get really lucky and I’ll die on a day my Spouse is actually home so my son won’t starve for however long it takes Spouse to get back from fucking their latest hook-up.  

I forget if there’s a point to this.  I don’t care.  I killed my cat today and it doesn’t fucking matter and nobody gives a damn and now I have to make up all the work I missed today because I was off killing my cat.
