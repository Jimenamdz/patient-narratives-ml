Hey y'all. It's been about 5 month since I posted. Here's an update. I finished chemo about a month ago. I am not terminal anymore. The cancer was localized and had not spread throughout my body. My post-treatmemt scans show NED (no evidence of disease). Everything is going great now for the time being. 

Thank you all for the comments, advice, and support! I really appreciate it. I will try to be on this account more and answer questions for people going through treatment, etc.
