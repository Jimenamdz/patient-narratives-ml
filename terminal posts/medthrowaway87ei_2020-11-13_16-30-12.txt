Hi everyone. Lung cancer guy again. Bad things are happening. Just got home from the hospital and barely avoided being admitted thanks to a palliative NP rushing over in the middle of the night to admit me into the home hospice program. I am forever grateful to her. I'm meeting the physician today. What kinds of questions should I ask?

My current list of questions is:

- Can you manage my pain after years of bupenorphine maintenance?

- Will someone be available to help me write letters? I'm cut off from my family but want to make amends.

- Will someone be with me all the time? I don't want to die alone and don't have anyone to call.

- Will I avoid terminal Restlessness and delirium? That is my only fear right now.

I don't think I have many more questions. Probably can't respond to many comments and PMs like I did last time. I'll try to post an update before I die.

Thank you for your help.

Edit: would also be nice to hear from others who have hospice experience.

Edit: thank you for your kind offers of helping me transcribe letters. I am not feeling strong enough tonight but perhaps tomorrow. Though, if things keep up at the same pace, tomorrow won't be looking too good. I will try to reach out if I can.
