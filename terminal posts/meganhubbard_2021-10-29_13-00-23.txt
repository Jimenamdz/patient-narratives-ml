Well they didn’t technically use that word, but that’s what it is. The only treatment options I have (IV chemo or oral chemo) will never cure me, they may not even affect my tumours at all. 

My cancer came back in my lungs, pelvis, and other parts of my body too, after almost 2 years NED. I’m so fucking pissed off. It’s so unfair that my type of cancer gets next to no funding, no alternatives, no trials, no studies. Nothing. I get to decide between two equally shit options, and I just have to deal with the fact that I’m not gonna be here a year from now. And I’m 19. Life is so fucking stupid. 

If anyone reading this is also terminal, please reach out.
