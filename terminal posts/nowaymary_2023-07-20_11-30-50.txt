Mostly with RAGE at people who will not understand that even though I'm not dying in my bed things are not all zippety doo dah. And if one more person says I'm in remission I will bean them. I'm NOT in remission. I have stage 4 metastatic cancer with a pretty new tumour that's developed. 
Winter is always more painful for me and I have been sick from colds that hit harder on me than my children but I'm doing my.bloody best it's just not enough....
I just wish people could understand that I don't need crying or prayers I need actual real help or for them to get out of the way. I don't have the energy to coddle anyone's emotions or help them process their crap. I have three children I'm doing that for. 
Some days the only one who gets it is my dog. I'm fully aware this is whiney as shit and will likely regret posting after a decent nights sleep whenever that happens....
Sometimes I actually think becoming terminal would be a good thing because I would be eligible for help. Thats so wrong of me
