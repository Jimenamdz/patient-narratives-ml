I was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in Nov 2018 shortly after my 37th birthday. The cancer was in my bowel and pushing into my spleen, pancreas and abdominal wall.

Throughout my treatment I have chemo and used thc oils as well, I had major surgery in May this year to remove my bowel, spleen, top of pancreas and abdominal wall followed by more chemo.

The only advise I can offer is:

Listen to your Dr's!! They actually want to cure you so do as you're told.

Research cannabis oils, expecially Thc,  I can't say if these help remove the cancer but for the quality of life they have given me and the help. With sleep, anxiety, food has been amazing! Use them!

Make getting better your No1 priority!   This is before your husband/wife/children/career /social life absolutely everything.  You need to be relaxing, de stressing and recovering, all of the above will be there when you're better.

Oxandrolone-   this is a product given to patients with aids/cancer or other diseases that cause muscle wastage.  I lost 8 stone during my treatment this product helped massively in holding onto some weight and building myself back up again. 

And stay positive, don't fear cancer, mock it, don't ever let yourself think that cancer will beat you as this is when it will! You need to fight and dig deep and make beating cancer your priority! It can be done!
