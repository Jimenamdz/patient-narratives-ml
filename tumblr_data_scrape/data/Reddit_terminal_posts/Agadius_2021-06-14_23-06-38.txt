Hi community. I have an 11 year old son, Andreas, that has AT/RT brain cancer. He was diagnosed in late May 2018. Since then he has received around 200 chemotherapy doses (initially the primary AT/RT protocol treatment, then the medulloblastoma "MEMMAT" protocol treatment), over 70 radiation therapies to his brain and spine, undergone several surgeries to remove tumors, and countless MRI scans. The initial surgery in 2018 which removed the primary tumor, made his left hand and leg semi-paralyzed (spastic) and his right eye non-functional (the pupil is always dilated and the movement is not coordinated with the other eye).

&#x200B;

During the last three years we've received the "he's not gonna make it past the next months"-message several times. And Andreas fought back. Each time. Metastasis in the spine? Radiation therapy. Metastasis in the brain? MEMMAT protocol with chemotherapy doses administered on average 2.5 times per week for over a year. More tumors in the brain? More radiation therapy, last time was in April 2021.

Unfortunately, even though he's been through hell and back, the cancer still grows. At least 10 tumors spread around the brain is now growing. He's starting to lose his ability to speak and swallow, due to a large tumor growing in the cerebellum. We have started with a fairly experimental drug called Tazverik, but the odds are so heavily against him and he is tired. He is currently trying to make peace with the fact that he is going to die very soon and he is saying his last goodbyes to friends and family.

In April 2019, when we received one of the "you're not gonna make it"-messages from the doctors, a childhood friend of mine (Lasse) who's a great musician, wrote a song to Andreas called "Main man" and recorded this with his band "Few Dollars More". This song has meant the world to Andreas. We listen to it several times a day and it gives us a mix of serenity, peace, melancholy and sorrow. Andreas finds great comfort in knowing that he actually has a song that the world will remember him by. He has requested me to "write to Reddit" and ask if they can listen to the song, because it is so important to him to let the world know that this song exists. All profits made from playbacks on Spotify/Tidal/Youtube goes to the The Norwegian Childhood Cancer Organization, so there are no individual profiting from this. Andreas just wants the song to be played for him these last weeks.

I am asking "Reddit" to visit Youtube and listen to his song. I am posting this in several subreddits and I am sorry if I'm breaking the rules of the subreddit you read this in by asking for views and likes, but right now I've got nothing to lose.

EDIT - thank you so much for all the wonderful comments and awards and whatnot. I’ve read all the beautiful comments and PM’s I’ve received to him, and he wanted to say thank you to the Reddit community:

It’s in Norwegian but he’s saying: “Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I really appreciated.. thanks for all the nice things you wrote to me. That made me happy”

EDIT 2 - Andreas loves to hear all your thoughts and comments. He really appreciates them. Thank you all of you. This has been a very good day for him, and each and every one of you have contributed to that. I asked him if he wanted to say something more. He wanted to do that (English translation in the description field on the YT video):
