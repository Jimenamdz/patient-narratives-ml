last month i found out i have stage 4 neuroendocrine cancer, as a 15 year old, a type of  cancer which is most common in people over 60.

my official diagnosis is acth-secreting metastatic high grade (3) poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carinoma, primary right lung

its metastasised in my liver, right adrenal gland, bones lymph nodes and soft tissue

it is incurable but im currently having chemo to slow it down with my second round in a week and im on medication to stop it secreting excessive  hormones, because im so young and pretty much no one this young has had this type of cancer at a stage this far they cant give me a prognosis of how long ill live for, but ive done quite a lot of research and i dont expect to live longer than a year. 

i have a therapist i see every week, but still with all the support i still feel alone like im the only one out there because i pretty much am.

i was in hospital for a month but im home now which is good, my oncologist said theyd call me tomorrow with my results of my full body pet scan i had last week which is good.

im so scared but im trying to stay positive, i keep thinking about why this happened to me and how i must have the worst luck.
