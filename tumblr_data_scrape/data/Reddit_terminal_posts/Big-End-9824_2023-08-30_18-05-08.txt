Just an update to let people know that I am now home from the hospice and I have home care set up. For those who don’t know, I have terminal colon cancer and had to spend three weeks in a hospice. Although the staff and place were exceptional I wanted to go home. I have a lot of abdominal pain and I am in a wheelchair and live on my own but now I can. I have nurses and carers coming up 3 times a day and manage my pain and help me dress. I am very grateful to all the Redditor’s who gave me messages of encouragement and I am still trying to answer them all. I am looking forward to playing my switch again. Once again thank you to all who replied I just wanted to give you all an update.
