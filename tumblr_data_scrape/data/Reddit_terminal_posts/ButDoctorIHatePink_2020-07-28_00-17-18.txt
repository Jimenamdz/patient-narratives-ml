Hi all!  I know that when diagnosed with cancer, stories about survival can be helpful. 

It’s been many years since I posted to Reddit or even looked at it. But years ago I did an AMA about my diagnosis with terminal cancer. I had been given two years to live (approximately). 

I have had numerous surgeries, have done 7 or 8 chemos, but 11 years later, I am still here. 

I was diagnosed with breast cancer that spread to liver and lungs. It is HER2+, one of the more rare and deadly forms. However, that turned out to be a good thing, as a year or so after diagnosis they started to do research and came out with anti-HER2+ drugs. Not everybody responds, but I did. 

I still go to chemo and have many of the problems that come with that. I’m not healthy, but I’m still here. I went from having a 12 year old who I merely wanted to see graduate HS, to watching him graduate from Caltech and get a good job in tech. 

I saw my oldest, who was 22, also get a good job, married a wonderful woman and then have children. My hair is grey, and I’m getting old (Although I still look pretty young!). I’ve lived a pretty good life and got many years that others didn’t. I’m grateful but think about my friends who died every day. 

But it’s starting to change, progress is being made and others will get those years too. 

The point is, hang in there. Do your treatments. You never know what can happen, and what’s around the corner. 

My nurses call me a miracle. I don’t believe in miracles, but I was at the right place at the right time. And I never wrote myself out. You can do that too. Good luck to all of you!
