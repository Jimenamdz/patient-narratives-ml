Of course cancer is painful for everyone and effects those involved, i know this. 

There's a specific pain with getting cancer at a young age. everyone else is still active and free, but suddenly my body is a cage i must watch so closely. 

i dont get to "come to terms with the life i've lived" it just started. i just became able to make my own choices. 

its only going to worsen the older you get. and youre not at the "end" of your expected life span

it also sucks that there isn't much on social media about these specific young immunocompromised disabled people. i feel like im the only guy dealing with these problems but i know that's not true


i'm lucky in a lot of ways and not yet terminal. just very negative. just wanted to vent i guess
