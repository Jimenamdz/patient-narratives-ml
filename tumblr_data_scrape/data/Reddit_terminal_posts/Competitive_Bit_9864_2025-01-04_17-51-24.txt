Title: Is NSCLC terminal? Mom with Stage 3 NSCLC (48, fit, non-smoker)

Hi everyone! My first day here and this question has bothered me ever since my mother got diagnosed in May 2024. As most of us know, receiving this diagnosis for a parent is heartbreaking and you feel so helpless. My mother showed no symptoms apart from pain in her right arm, upon which the doctor detected a lump in her neck and ran a biopsy. This confirmed the unfortunate - she had stage 3 lung adenocarcinoma (non small cell) which had spread to lymph nodes in her neck. Weirdly, she is 48, active and healthy, and has never touched alcohol or cigarettes in her life. But we know lung cancer does not discriminate.

She was administered a chemo session while we awaited her gene results and was then put on Lorlatinib (ALK+). She showed considerable improvement in her PET scan (attached below) that was done after 4 months of being on this medicine. She is now due for her next scan this month.

I'm an anxious person myself and it has been so difficult to come to terms with this but am really just wondering and researching the internet all the time. Is there hope? Will she see me get married? My younger brother get a job?

Is there a world where her NSCLC diagnosis becomes a chronic illness instead of a terminal one?

Thank you for reading, love and strength to all!
