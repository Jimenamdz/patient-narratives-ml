Found myself in a really rough patch and need a moan.

I'm very lucky that I've finished my treatment and am currently NED but this phase is so damn hard.
It's a mixture of things, knowing I'm not actively doing something to keep the cancer away, and worrying about it coming back (including delayed surveillance scans). But also my treatment triggered early menopause and I'm on HRT. I'm not sure if it's because I've been on it for a few months now or because I finished my treatment, or both but my hormones are going crazy. The HRT helped my hot flushes and I thought I wouldn't have to deal with periods anymore but they are coming back, my moods are nuts and I already had depression issues before I got diagnosed. Then last night I had a dream where the cancer was back and progressed to terminal and I was dying and it really freaked me out. I started back at work earlier this year and called in sick today and I'm worried my manager is getting annoyed. Everything just feels so hard. I'm already in therapy and I don't want to go on antidepressants. I feel like there's nothing that helps. It's so weird that somehow life seemed easier when I was going through treatment because it seemed simpler when my only goal was survive and had everything (appointmens etc) planned out for me.
