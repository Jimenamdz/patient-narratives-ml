I have a coworker who previously had cancer and beat it. He went to the doctor this week and found out it has spread to his lungs. The doctor told him he has 6 months to live. He works 7 days a week and can’t quit due to living expenses. I feel so sad for him. He can’t even cope with his feelings and can only focus on working to pay bills. I was wondering if anyone else has had  experiences with this kind of thing. The doctor has helped him apply for emergency disability but It will take him months or more to get approved/denied. Is there a charity or place he can go for help with this? He shouldn’t have to spend the last few months of his life working. I’m so disappointed in the American system right now.

Update: He had been approved for emergency disability but they were making him wait two months to start receiving it (February 2023). I got an update tonight that they have turned off his oxygen and he most likely won’t make it through the night. I’m so devastated that he couldn’t spend his last months in peace. Luckily he has a lot of loving coworkers who did their best to support him in whatever way we could. Thank you guys for your responses, it’s really nice to see that people care.

Update 2: Keith has passed away at 11:30 am on December 15th, 2022. We will miss him dearly.
