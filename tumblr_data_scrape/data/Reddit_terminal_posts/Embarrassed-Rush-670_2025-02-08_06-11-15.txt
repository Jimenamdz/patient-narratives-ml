Hello

Just checking in. Its been a while. Dying is not great thank God we're all doing it only once.

Going through a lot of random swellings on my body right now. Cancer is progressing just like how well I'm progressing at work. ðŸ˜‚

Got a good increment this year. Bosses were happy despite of my illness. 

A lot of bone pains and swelling going on right now and its uncomfortable. Had a scare that my heart was stopping the other day because it suddenly started getting slower and then fluttered a bit.

Hope everyone is doing fine and sending lots of love.  ðŸ©·
