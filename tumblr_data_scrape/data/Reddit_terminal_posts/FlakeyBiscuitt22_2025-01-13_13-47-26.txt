I guess I’m writing here to see if anyone else has done insight or inspiration. I’m 28 years old and healthy other than stage four colon cancer. I HIPEC in October 2024. PCI of 6. Cecum, appendix, and terminal ileum all cancerous. Had two Mets to my peritoneal area. 

Anyways, I have started chemo, FOLFOX. Everyday, and I mean, every day, I wake up in some sort of pain. My incision. My back. My ribs. My abdominal muscles. My bladder. For three months straight I’ve been in pain. Where is the light at the end of the tunnel? Between chemo and HIPEC, I’m so depressed. I get chemo every other week. I’m so sick the week of chemo and four days after. I sleep all the time. My fiancé has taken over everything because I’m either in too much pain or I’m so tired. I just need some “pick me up.”
