I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer about 1.5 years ago.  Stage four because it had migrated from my esophagus to my left lung. I was given treatment that was palliative in nature.  Ten high intensity radiation treatments and then chemotherapy.  The chemo made me so sick that I was admitted to the hospital for four nights and in emergency multiple times. I was so sick that I signed up for assisted dying. They cut back the dose to 50% and it became barely tolerable.  I was then found to be a good candidate for Herceptin treatments.  It worked so well that the cancer disappeared from my stomach and esophagus.  The cancer on my lung was shrinking.    
But, the cancer mutated and started growing again.  So here I am, about to go back on chemo again, and I am dreading it.  I am trying to stay positive but it is becoming difficult.  I put on a brave face for my family and friends, but I am beginning to realize the reality and deal with my eventual death.  This is such a personal experience that it is difficult to explain to anyone what I am feeling.
