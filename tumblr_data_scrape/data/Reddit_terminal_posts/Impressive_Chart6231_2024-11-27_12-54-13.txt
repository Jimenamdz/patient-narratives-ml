Hi

I’ve been following this group but haven’t posted much. I have terminal breast cancer with lung metastasis, amongst other things. My lungs are really affected at the moment, filling up with fluid. I can barely do anything cause I get breathless. My oxygen requirements have been increasing during the last week. I’m in hospital. I’m really scared of dying, the moment of being unable to breathe when the doctor can’t do anything about it. 

Do you have some experiences or positive thoughts that may help? Normally I wouldn’t care about dying young, it’s just the suffering that terrifies me at the moment. I can’t even fall asleep.

Thank you
