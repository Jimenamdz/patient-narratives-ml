Title: Thinking of ending it.

Content:
I have stage 4 lung cancer. I have 3 teen children. The oldest is 19, youngest is 14. I'm thinking of ending things before it gets too bad. The problem is I don't want to go too soon but I don't want it to be too late either. I don't want my kids to see me get emaciated. I don't want them or my husband responsible for my every function. I can't stand the thought of them seeing me like that. I want them to remember me happy and healthy (as healthy as I can be now) Right now im on oxygen almost constantly. I can't still do most tasks but for the most part I can't clean much anymore. Even cooking makes me tired now. I can tell I'm declining despite my scans showing miniscule improvement. I'm on my third line of treatment, meaning I'm running out of viable treatment options. My state unfortunately hasn't legalized the assistance of death for terminal patients. I'd have to do it myself. I guess I want to know, would you forgive your parent if they were dying anyway? Would you prefer that you were spared the inevitable of seeing your parent emaciated and in pain and suffering? Or would you be  upset that you were robbed of the time? I will die. They won't be spared that regardless. But maybe I can spare myself and them some pain.
