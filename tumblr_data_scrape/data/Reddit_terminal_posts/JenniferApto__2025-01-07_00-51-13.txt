8 weeks ago, I was admitted to the hospital for back pain and they thought it was stage 2 adenocarcinoma but it has been determined to be stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma which is terminal. I have been in the hospital the whole time trying to figure things out. I am employed in Rhode Island and have 4 weeks left on FMLA. I do not have short term disability but I do have long term disability but that can only start 26 weeks after I was first admitted (LTD would start May 27, 2025). The cancer is terminal and I am in palliative care receiving radiation treatment at the hospital. 

If FMLA ends on January 30th, can I get fired before LTD kicks in on May 27th? I have tried to speak with my HR group but it's rats maze of robots, being on hold, and speaking to people who have no clue who to ask. In the 8 weeks, I have been hospitalized, I have called nearly every day and only talked to a supervisor that helped me once. I am not able to work and will likely never leave the hospital again and I'm trying to remain positive but I'm so worried about what will happen after FMLA ends.

  
To make matters worse, I found out my FMLA leave ended on December 19th, two days before my terminal cancer was discovered, and I am now trying to get back on. My benefits supervisor said they only mail letters and it was mailed to my house which I have not been at in 8 weeks. They said the best thing to do is log in every day to confirm my status which seems like torture if I've never left the hospital.
