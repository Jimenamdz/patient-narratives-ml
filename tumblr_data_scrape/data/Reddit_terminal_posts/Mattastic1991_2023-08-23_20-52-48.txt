Hello hello and hello! 

I've been posting and commenting in this community more and more, and today I am officially 1 full complete year into remission with stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer.  

It's crazy to believe that I'm 32 and alive with one of the most deadly cancers and the fact that my liver had taken the most damage....

But hear I am...alive...crying because I'm gonna make it. 

Unfortunately, even with remission, I'm still considered terminal since as many of you know, I can't be cured and will always have this, and that surgery is not possible because it would kill me. 

It's been a crazy year, and I've been battling the depression more and more each day becaof what cancer took from me, but I came back and took more from it. 

I spend most my time playing video games, spend time with my parents, and watch the shows and movies I missed. Most importantly, I spend time telling my story to groups such as this and also making tiktoks so that I can reach out to people who are going thru a terminal illness or cancer who don't have friends or family to talk to, because I sincerely believe no one should ever fight alone, ever. 

I love knowing that I'm doing my dream of helping people.  Even though I have no money or anything, I still have a heart and I wanna do my best to help give people hope. Even when someone is tired and weak, and is feels as if they can't fight anymore, I fight for them, I tell them how important it is that have you here, and that you'll get through this. It'll be tough, it'll hurt, but together, we will win. 

Sorry for making this longer than it should, I love being able to talk. 

Here's to seeing another year ❤️ my inbox is always open if you need a friend. Please don't ever be afraid to talk to me. 

I love you, and I believe in you
