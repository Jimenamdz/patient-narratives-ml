Hi guys! I was diagnosed with stage iv endometrial Carcinosarcoma last year and successfully completed 7 rounds of chemo/immunotherapy and now have a 6 week cycle for my immunotherapy (Jemperli) and can’t stand it! I thought it would be a cake walk after what I went through with chemo but this is making me itchy and uncomfortable on top of throwing up randomly and never really know when it’ll hit. At least with chemo I was able to time out when I’d feel awful and adjust accordingly but this has made it so I have skin that looks like a lizard, and is all scratched up but I have to carry prochlorazine (I think that’s what it is) around in case nausea hits. 

Has anyone else had this issue with their immunotherapy? I feel like a big baby for bringing things like this to my doc but boy I am miserable and nothing helps. I take an antihistamine and it helps a little and use benedryl-esque cream with aloe and it also helps but not enough. What do you think they’ll do for me when/if I mention it at my next appointment? I’m also concerned that it’s affecting my liver with all the itching- but that could be the hypochondriac in me lol. It’s a common side effect but I’m really hoping I won’t need to go down with my dose, keeping a recurrence away is the name of the game right now because I am essentially terminal. Odds are it’ll come back it’s just a matter of time but I want my quality of life back, I wanna go back to work I just don’t see how it’s possible yet. Please let me know I’m not the only one having a rough go with immunotherapy lol thanks friends
