I started my cancer journey back in June 2020 at the age of 36. I’m 41 and terminal now. It’s getting to the point where chemotherapy is killing me so the tumor board decided to do radiation again to give me more time. Waiting on results from a recent Brian MRI, pretty sure they found something because it’s the first time I didn’t receive my results within 24 hours. I’m done though, I’m at the point of just stopping all treatments and go travel. When it first spreads to my lungs I was optimistic but now I’m on my 6th line of treatment and breathing is becoming a chore. I’ve been doing all this treatments for my kids. My older kids are adults(21 & 20) and the baby is almost 14 and we’re in the middle of adopting her out to my Aunt and Uncle. She’s taken care of so does it make me a terrible person if I wanna just tell my oncologist to stop all treatments? Radiation to the lungs doesn’t sound appealing again. I feel guilty and upset this is my life I was chosen to live. Then again I’m tired of other people telling me they’re not ready for me to go. For some reason that triggers me more. I’m sorry MY cancer affects them but I’ve told those people to go get their own cancer and dictate what they want then. They stop giving me their opinions real quick. I hate being mean to them but they don’t understand or care to. Today is Valentine’s Day and probably my last one. 6-12 months was my time frame I was given if I stopped all treatments. I see other cancer patients fight so hard to live and here I am every morning when my eyes open I’m like damn another day. My therapist says it’s normal to feel this way. I wish I could enjoy my life without feeling like it’s all for nothing. How do I make myself feel like this isn’t all for nothing? How do I enjoy my life? I’m open to  ideas.
