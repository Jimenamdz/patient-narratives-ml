So I recently found out that my cancer came back and has spread again throughout my arm and my lungs. It's getting extremely frustrating dealing with the fact that I might never be cancer free. Literally none of the treatments I've been on worked. I feel so defeated and drained. I wanna keep fighting but in the back of my mind I'm thinking what's the point if it's just gonna keep coming back. I've been re-staged as terminal but treatable now. This honestly sucks. Idk what to do anymore.
