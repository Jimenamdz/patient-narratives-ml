[primary colon cancer with liver and peritoneum mets]

On 30th of April I quit chemotherapy. And a week later I left for India. I travelled till my symptoms came. They came rather quickly I thought I would have more time. 

Speed forward to beginneing of June symptoms became more serious so I started to get in touch with the hospice. I opted for residential hospice meaning I leave in the hospice and I get help 24h. It was my choice to be here rather than be home.

They already started giving me morphin which is quite surprising. The other painkillers do not help me anymore. I am surprised because I am still able to stand up and move without needing any help. I am wondering how long I have left till I become unconscious now that I am getting morphine. Doctors don't want to give me an answer. Do you have any idea? Any similar experience?

Also if you have questions I am glad to help if I can

This book Nothing to fear demystifying death to live more fully by Julie McFadden has helped me understand a lot about hospice and terminal stage care.

Love you all
