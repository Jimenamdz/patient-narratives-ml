I have posted a few times on this sub. Its amazing the total lack of understanding people have in this day of modern technology where you can find the temp of a burger in London on the internet but cant be bothered to look up what Terminal means.

The weather here has been getting better and i was at my camp. Some people i never meet before were walking/hiking and stopped for water. ( there is a spring on my property that people get water from its been tested and its very pure and clean)

We were talking and asked if i would ever sell the place. I said no it was going to my niece when i passed. I said i would be here now that the weather is better and stop by anytime they see my truck.

They asked if i worked because i seemed to young to be retired. I said i have cancer and now i am disabled due to being on chemo for the rest of my life and it was terminal.

The woman said that's terrible only having a few months to live. I was like HUH? Ah no i have a few years yet. I will just have chemo for the rest of my life.

She seemed puzzled and started asking a bunch of questions. Terminal does not mean you are going to die tomorrow. In my case it just means they cant cure it does not mean they cant control it.

Some people live for years with cancer i hope i am one.
