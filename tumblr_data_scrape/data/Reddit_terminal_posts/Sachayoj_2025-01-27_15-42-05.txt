She's in her 50s and has terminal brain cancer, as well as current pneumonia. Her legs pretty much don't work despite being released from the hospital after supposedly getting her strength back (if anything, she's worse than before the stay) and can't even stand. Trying to get her out of bed, into a wheelchair, and onto the couch of our living room is near impossible for my father, who's also 50s and complaining of constant back pain. I'm only 22, and don't have much strength, but help in changing her diapers and getting her food. Is there any easier ways that won't cause my father to permanently fuck up his spine? He's considering putting her in hospice for good, or leaving her bedbound. There was no training on how to do this.
