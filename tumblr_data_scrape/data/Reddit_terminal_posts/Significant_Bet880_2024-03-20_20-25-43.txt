Hi all, I am 36 years old, I  live in the west midlands UK. I was diagnosed July 2021 with terminal metastatic Leiomyosarcoma cancer, I have done pretty well with stable scans, had some small 2mm growths on my liver as scans showed. I have cancer in the uterus, pelvis, liver, spine and my right shoulder, socket and arm bone. 

I live a normal life, I love to laugh, smile, joke and stay positive I just miss having someone to laugh and joke with, cuddles and kisses... feel I am going to die never experiencing any of that again which really saddens me.

Does anyone else ever feel this way?
Any men out there 35+ who are kind, funny,  affectionate... possible beard and tattoos who likes rock.... 🤣🤣🤣 girl can dream
