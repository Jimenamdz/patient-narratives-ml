I'm 30 and going to die soon. I've had a year to come to terms with it. Here is how I rationalize it if it can be of help to anyone.

I was lucky to have so much time to think this over, time really does help to accept the inevitable. We all know it's coming someday. It just comes sooner for some. People say I'm pretty zen considering the circumstances and I'd say it is an accurate assessment. I certainly wouldn't be this zen if I had just learned I had cancer AND a few weeks to live at the same time. I knew every step of the way my chances were very slim and my oncologists were very honest about it.

I'm not saying it's a walk in the park either, I have serious pain issues, I'm heavily medicated and I try to beat into submission that stupid feeling of guilt for making people who love me feel sad. No, it's not your fault you have cancer, but you feel like the bearer of bad news all the time and that can take its toll. I usually just tell my SO my brain is trying to make me feel guilty today and she makes it go away with a kind word and a hug. Which brings me to making a small list of what helps me deal with the situation. This is the internet after all and we like lists!

* **I surround myself with people who make me feel good.** Not all of your friends and loved ones will react well to your situation and that's ok, we all have our strength and weaknesses. Identify those who make you feel good when you hang out with them instead of those who will leech your energy without even meaning to. Let them deal with their emotions, they got plenty more time and energy to spend than you.

* **I feel blessed every day that I have the time to say goodbye instead of leaving everyone suddenly by surprise.** I'm a young adult, statistically, I should die of a suicide or a sudden car crash, not of cancer. I feel so blessed that I have the time to plan my funeral, to write letters to loved ones, to say the things that matter and offer loved ones that opportunity as well. I think this is much preferable to the alternative, but I've met others with terminal cancer who say they would have prefered to die instantly by surprise so maybe I'm the exception.

* **I've already been dead for a few billion years, and it wasn't too bad.** As you can guess from this I don't believe in an afterlife at all. For me dying is a return to the state I was in before my birth. The year 1900 isn't very scary to me even if I did not exist. The year 2020 isn't very scary to me for the same reasons. Non-existence is my standard state except for that small blimp of life I will have been blessed to experience over the universe's lifespan. Maybe this is a scary concept to some but it brings me comfort.

* **I accept I have absolutely no control over the progress of my illness.** I know some people have a need for the illusion of control, but the truth is that apart from eating well, sleeping sufficiently, doing you chemo/treatment, getting a bit of exercise even if it's just walking and making the effort to have a social life, all of these when possible, then you're already doing everything you can. Give yourself a pat on the back and try to accept that things will happen whether you like it or not, so try to enjoy the ride even if you're not the one driving.

* **I have little time, it is precious, but I must accept my energy is limited and I have the right to rest without feeling guilty.** I can't let the feeling that I'm somehow wasting time if I Netflix and chill take over. I have little time, yes, but I have a right to use some of that time to relax without feeling guilty. My body and mind need rest and I need a sense of normality.

* **I give myself small goals and projects.** If I just wait passively for death, then I feel like it's wasted time. Even if I probably just have a few weeks at most, then I'll find a small project to accomplish during that time that I can realistically accomplish and be proud of. In my case, it's writing one goodbye letter to every person I love and making a video montage for my funeral. For me, productive time is a happy time, especially knowing it will bring joy to loved ones.

* **I've lived making sure I'd regret nothing and I'm surrounded by loved ones.** Now, this part is the one that helps me the most but It can be too late for the first part and you may have no control over the loved ones part. I'm lucky that my grandfather told me on his deathbed when I was 16 that when I'd be dying I wouldn't regret my mistakes but instead the things I never tried but would have wanted to accomplish. I took that advice to heart and applied it every day of my life. Maybe it's too late for you to apply that advice, but it makes my incoming death a hell of a lot easier knowing I have no regrets and wouldn't change a thing in my life apart from cancer. I also understand you don't control if you have a good family and you may not have had the chance to develop good friendships, and I'm sorry if that's the case. There are support groups out there that may help you but I imagine it must be a poor substitute. Having no regrets and being surrounded by loved ones is simply what helps me the most through this.


There, I think that covers it. I wish you all the best and if a single element in this list has helped someone out there then I consider this post was worth it. Good luck everyone!
