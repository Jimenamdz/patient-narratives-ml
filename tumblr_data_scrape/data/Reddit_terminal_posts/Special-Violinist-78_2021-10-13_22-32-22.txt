2 months ago my stomach started to hurt-ish consistently. 1 month ago Dr. schedules me a colonoscopy. A week ago was the colonoscopy and the surgeon says my colon is 90% blocked and its cancerous. Get a CT the same day. Today Dr discusses the results: cancer on the liver, in the lungs, along the aorta. Stage 4 terminal. I'm a fit as a fiddle never been in a hospital 43M.

So yeah, ouch. Deal with the resection first then learn about oncology.
