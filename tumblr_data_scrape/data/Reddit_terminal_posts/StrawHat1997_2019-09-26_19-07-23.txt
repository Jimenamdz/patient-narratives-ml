Title: Today, on my 22nd birthday, they told me that it's very likely that my cancer is terminal.

It's leukemia, and it's aggressive. They still will be trying a couple of treatments, but they're so experimental, and only a handful of people in the world did it so far, without great results.

And the meeting was awkward. The doctors wished a happy birthday for me, but at the same time they had to tell me the truth.

I'm not necessarily scared, I just feel like I won't have time to wrap things up when the time comes.
