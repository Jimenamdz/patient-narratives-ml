Doctors were quite unclear and due to the fast paced nature of my wifes (39 F) diagnosis - rushed to hospital with pain and puking to discover it wasn't her gallstone causing it as doctors had always said but a T4 tumor, operated on the next morning etc.

Sorry if I have not given enough detail but we recently got the first PET scan results and were told the doctors were "unsure" if they can cure this. They have suggested heavy form of Chemo for first 3 months to see if it can be shrunk. They mentioned a potential operation but advised against as it's very dangerous (cancer is near main artery in abdomen). So there advice seems to be to try shrink it via chemo to increase survival time but to not operate or intend to cure it? I understand them not wanting to come out and say it blankly, but we are left not knowing whether to have hope, get a second opinion or start preparing for the worst. 

Anyone else experienced this form of cancer spread or know someone who has? We see a lot of survival stage 4 colon cancer stories but almost all are from people who had it spread to the liver or lungs and could be operated on without as much risk. We don't know what to think given there is a potential operation but it's just dangerous and possibly a last resort? We also don't know if the chemo could cure her by itself, I felt the doctors didn't imply this but we are not sure. 

Thank you in advance for any advice.
