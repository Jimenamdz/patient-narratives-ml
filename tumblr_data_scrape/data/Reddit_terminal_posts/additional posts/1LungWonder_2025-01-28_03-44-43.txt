Our little lump of Coal that we brought in out of the cold on Christmas Eve is doing really well!! He’s getting more brave and will come out for pets and churu anytime one of us goes in the room. We got all the tests back from the vet and he’s totally healthy! Next up, getting him fixed, but we’re giving him a little more time to acclimate. 
He loves sleeping on the bed and can be found there most days. 
We leave the bedroom door open at night so he can explore while everyone else is sleeping.. we have yet to introduce him to the other resident cat, but that will also come in time. We’re letting him lead the way. 
Here are a few pictures of him eating his favorite treat! 
Thanks CDS for this sweet boy! We love him.
