Im 16 with a metastasised high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, I finished iv chemo 3 months ago but sadly my cancers spreading again so i’m starting oral chemo next week. But since starting my first chemo i’ve had terrible memory and i’ve not been able to think clearly, does anyone else have this or any ways to help?
