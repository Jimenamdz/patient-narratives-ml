Title: Work history criteria - Would I be eligible

Before when I looked at available support some of the benefits required you to have been working for the previous two full tax years to qualify (I had gaps)
I've now technically been employed for over two years but a large chunk of that time I was signed off sick.
Would that count and I'd pass that criteria or would the sickness period count against me?
