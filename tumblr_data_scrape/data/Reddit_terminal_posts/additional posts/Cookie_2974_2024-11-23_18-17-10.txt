Title: How to prevent banking issues upon sale?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1gy609b/how_to_prevent_banking_issues_upon_sale/
Content:
I'm selling a house and need to give account details to receive my money.
Apparently it can only be a current account not a savings account.
Upon receipt of funds I want to immediately transfer it back out (and spread into a couple of different savings accounts)
How do I do this without all kinds of potential fraud issues / getting accounts frozen etc?

Edit: not sure if it matters for this issue but I'm in England
