A boy, about 9, opened the door.  
"Is your dad or your mum home?" said the farmer. "No, they went to town".  
"How about your brother, Howard? Is he here?" "No, he went with mum and dad".  
The farmer stood there for a few minutes, shifting from one foot to the other, and mumbling to himself.  
"I know where all the tools are if you want to borrow one? Or I can give dad a message". said the boy.  
"Well" said the farmer uncomfortably "I really wanted to talk to your dad. It's about your brother, Howard, getting my daughter Susie pregnant".  
The boy thought for a moment.  
"You would have to talk to dad about that. I know he charges $500 for the bull and $50 for the pig, but I don't know how much he charges for Howard".
