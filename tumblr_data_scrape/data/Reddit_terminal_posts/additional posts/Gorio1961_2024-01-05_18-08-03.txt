On January 1, 2024, Senate Bill 2 became law. In my opinion, this law is an all-out attack on firearms and people who legally possess them. CCW's are designed to allow citizens to be prepared to defend themselves and their families in life threatening situations. In my opinion, this is a law trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist. My question to the Governor and the Attorney General is how many CCW holders have used their ability to conceal a firearm to commit illegal shootings?
 
I have no desire to criminalize CCW holders. We will not be standing at the church entrance to make sure CCW holders are unarmed. With that said, I cannot speak for other law enforcement agencies throughout the State of California. I want Kern County Citizens who possess CCW's, to read the law and be aware. I also encourage you to write to the Department of Justice to share your view.
