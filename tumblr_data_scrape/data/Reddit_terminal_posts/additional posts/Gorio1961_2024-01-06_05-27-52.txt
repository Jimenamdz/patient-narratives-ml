Title: USAA Account Take Over (ATO) Scam Follow-up

A couple of weeks ago, I posted details of three fraudulent account activities culminating in USAA telling me it was an ATO Scam.  I received a written report today that a third party used a "Convenience Check" from ELAN Financial Services (associated with a credit card issued by First Mid Bank & Trust, NA) to deposit $9,990.00 into my USAA Savings account. A $4990.00 transfer into my USAA checking, and then a final withdrawal (transfer) of $4,000.00 to an external (non-USAA) account.

In the end, I didn't lose any funds, as these activities were promptly reported, and the accounts in question were closed.  I spoke again today with USAA Fraud Investigators, and they told me the fraud investigation is now a criminal investigation and my funds are now secure.

I am still trying to figure out how these scammers gained access to my accounts.  PINs, passwords, and email accounts have all been changed (three times).  

This evening, I received an email notification of two failed micro-deposit transactions, and once again, the Fraud team is looking at my accounts.
