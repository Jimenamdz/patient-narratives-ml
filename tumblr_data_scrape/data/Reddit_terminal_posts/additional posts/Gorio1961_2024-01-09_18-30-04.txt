The 2023 OPM FEVS administration period closed on 14 July 2023. Of just over 162,000 eligible civilian employees, 29,434 provided feedback on the 2023 FEVS, giving the DAF an 18.2% participation rate. DAF participation remained the lowest of the DoD Components; however, the DAF was the only Component to increase its response rate from 2022.

Responses to FEVS questions are grouped into five Indices that can be used to measure employees’ perceptions of whether and to what extent conditions of successful organizations are present in their organizations. The DAF 2023 Index scores improved across the board and, except for the Employee Experience Index, were at or above both the DoD and Gov’t-wide Index scores.

**Employee Engagement:** 74% \[+1.1%\]

**Global Satisfaction:** 65% \[+1.9%\]

**Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility:** 72% \[+1.8%\]

**Performance Confidence:** 84% \[+0.7%\]

Employee Experience: 73% (new Index as of 2023)
