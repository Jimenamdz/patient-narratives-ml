Title: Assisting a Vet's surviving spouse (claim timeline)

Content:
A good friend (and fellow retired USAF vet) passed away last year from colon cancer; he was previously SC'd at 70%, and before he passed, a claim was filed under the PACT Act for his colon cancer.  The surviving spouse has been working with a VSO on the claim that was filed.  It has been almost a year, and she's getting frustrated with the wait to find out the claim results.

Do any fellow vets or surviving spouses have timelines to share?  I am attempting to give her hope of hearing back from the VA.  She has been checking the app every day (like most of us, at one time or another) only to see the same two green blocks with no progress.
