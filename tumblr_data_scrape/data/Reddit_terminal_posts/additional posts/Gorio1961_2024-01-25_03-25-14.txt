Title: Acqdemo Payout question revisited

First and foremost. This is not bitch post. I am truly confused and trying to understand. 

I work in DoD and this is our organization’s first year in AcqDemo. As a result of the salary appraisal process, I received a carry over CRI of $2,562 and a Contribution Award of $3,740. Today, two SF-50s posted into my personnel account 1) General Increase notification and 2) Lump Sum Performance Payment. 

The Award SF50 reflected my award of $2,562 and the General Increase reflected a $2,728 Locality increase and a $4,865 base pay increase.  

I guess here’s my question. Where’s the $3,740 Contribution Award?  Is that amount rolled into my base pay increase. 

Thanks in advance.
