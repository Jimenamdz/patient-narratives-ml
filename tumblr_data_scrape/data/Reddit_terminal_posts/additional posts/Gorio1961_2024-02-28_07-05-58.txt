Title: Pairing suggestions LCD-5s and AMP/DAC combo...

 I attended an Audeze-sponsored audiophile group this past weekend in Orange County.  As part of the attendance, Audeze offered a 50% discount on the entire product line. I purchased the LCD-5s; the final price was under $2,500.00 (taxes included and free shipping).

While I wait for them to arrive (2 or 3 weeks), I find myself in the market for a proper AMP/DAC. Are there any suggestions from LCD-5 owners?

  
I demoed several high-end AMP/DAC combos at the event...but I wanted to ask you guys.
