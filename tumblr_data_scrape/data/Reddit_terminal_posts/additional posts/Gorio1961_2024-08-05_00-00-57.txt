My nephew, a long-time (27 years) California Corrections employee, recently retired and filed for Social Security benefits. He was denied because he has at most four years of credits.  According to him, he didn't know he wasn't paying Social Security Taxes while employed by the state. I'm just asking here because he came to me for advice. It was the first time I had ever heard of something like this.  My advice? I told him to find a job and work for another four years.
