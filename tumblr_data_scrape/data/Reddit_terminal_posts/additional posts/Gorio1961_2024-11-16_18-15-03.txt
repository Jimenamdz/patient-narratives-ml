Title: Has the Los Angeles Airport Marriott minimized (or even eliminated) Military/Govt Rate stay availability?

As a regular business traveler on Government travel, I've used the LAX Marriott as my "jumping off point" for the past 19 years. However, this past year, I've noticed that the usual Military/Government rate is no longer available. It's a great place and an excellent location, and now I've had to search for other alternatives. It's now the Sheraton Gateway at LAX. Sadly, the Sheraton amenities are lacking compared to the Flgaship LAX Marriott.

Is it my imagination, or has anyone noticed the diminished rate offers?
