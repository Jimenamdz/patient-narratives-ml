I was traveling through LA, and as a recent Titanium-level achiever, I requested the "complementary" upgrade. I was given an executive suite on the 18th floor and early and late checkout times.  I commented that I would be dining in the on-premise Steakhouse, and the desk attendant arranged my reservation.    Sometimes, it's the little things that matter.  I also love the 75% reward level.
