This past weekend was my sixth trip in four months (RT LAX to GTF), and as usual, it went off without a hitch.  While the terminal in Salt Lake City can be a long walk, layovers were well planned, and that's a nice airport.  Arriving at LAX with all of the fires was also a breeze.  With the craziness in Atlanta, I felt blessed to be a West Coast traveler.
