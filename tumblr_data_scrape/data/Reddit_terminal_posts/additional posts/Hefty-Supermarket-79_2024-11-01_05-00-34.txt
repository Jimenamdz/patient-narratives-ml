Title: Moon face? Without prednisone?

Content:
I'm just learning about moon face. (My lupus and rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis came June 2023) My face is so fitting, visually. But, I'm not on prednisone. I'm not sure if it's the extra weight that I can't seem to lose, or if it's autoimmune related.
