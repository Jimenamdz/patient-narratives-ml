I found a lady who sells plants that shes growing at her home. Great prices and they're healthy. Way better, all around, than The Big Stores.

We got a Swiss Cheese Monstera (what my goal was, when going to her place), Golden Pothos, and an adorable zebra plant. (I have EDS/Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, and our mascot is the zebra, so this makes me happy. )

The 2 big plants are super full. I neef advice:
1. How much bigger of a pot should I go with?
2. Should I split them into 2 or three separate plants? If so, what's the best method that won't hurt the roots?
3. Zebra: should I repot her? How much bigger? And what conditions are best for her?
4. Fertilizer...I've got Jack's all purpose, liquid B-1, and shake and feed for palm and related plants. What combo? How often? (I am also working to health-i-fie my bigger, but somewhat sad, Monsteras from Trader Joe's...
