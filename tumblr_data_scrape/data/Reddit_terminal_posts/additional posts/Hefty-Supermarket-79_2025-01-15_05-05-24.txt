Title: Methotrexate and waxing?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/1i1q6b4/methotrexate_and_waxing/
Content:
I've had 3 doses of methotrexate. (The last one was Thursday)

I'm scheduled to get my lip and chin waxed tomorrow, but just realized I should look into whether it is OK to wax while on methotrexate?!?

I've read it MIGHT be advised against. So...I want to hear your experiences
