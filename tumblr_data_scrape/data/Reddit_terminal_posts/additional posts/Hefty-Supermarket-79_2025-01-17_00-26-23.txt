Holy hell. Week 4, but first round with injection form. I was hoping it would be better than the oral meds. I'm so miserable. Headache, extreme nausea, very dizzy, every part of me feels shaky, my vision is off, I am cold, stomach hurts, extra time on the toilet (tmi...).

I bought new mucinex DM, took it with the injection. I upped the folic acid. I took 8mg of Zofran. And I've been hydrating and getting plenty of protein.

Folic acid:I was on 1mg daily, but upped it to 2mg yesterday and today.

I'm down for the count. I had called my rheum yesterday, to see about getting something besides Zofran, because the nausea wasn't subsiding much between doses, and Zofran barely touches it. I haven't heard back and they closed early today.

I truly feel 4 doses, with each week the side effects getting worse, and coming on faster...I think it's long enough of a chance to decide not to  take it anymore. Obviously, I will do this while working with my dr...but I need ways to get through the next few hours, and days...

I've got a photo session on Sat morning (I'm a photographer) and I am worried about being able to do it...
