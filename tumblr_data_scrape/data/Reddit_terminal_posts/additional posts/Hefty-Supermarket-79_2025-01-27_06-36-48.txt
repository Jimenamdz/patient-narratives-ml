I am 52, have lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, my skin is dry and sensitive, and my fine lines mostly show up when I wear makeup!

I also have rosacea and occasional hard red bumps that are not acne, but autoimmune crap. So, I want to cover the red and bumps, without it making me look actually more dry and old, blah...

Yes, I moisturize, hydrate, and use primer.

I have tried various liquid foundation, concealers, cream makeup, just powder...
