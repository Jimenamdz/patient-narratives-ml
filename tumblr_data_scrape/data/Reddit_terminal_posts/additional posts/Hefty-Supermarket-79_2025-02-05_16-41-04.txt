My Rinvoq prescription is arriving today. I'm hearing mostly good things about it. Success, low or no side effects, works quickly... The pharmacist said to take it with a big meal, as the only real issue is that it can be hard on the stomach lining, similarly to ibuprofen. 

He also said stay away from ibuprofen so that I am not over loading my stomach with meds that are hard on it.

Anything else that I should know? What about time of day? Does anyone have to plan to take it at a certain time or day due to initial side effects?

My rheum also takes it and she says it made all the difference with her hands. She and I are both 52 and have 7 yr old kiddos and have many of the same health issues and quirks, so I'm hopeful...
