Title: New here! How to identify crystals?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iiw6bw

Hello! I inherited a decent size crystal collection from my mom when she passed away. I gifted many to her other loved ones. Keeping some for myself. Need to sell the rest to pay off expenses for her care last year. 

But...I don't know the best way to identify some that I am not familiar with. Plus, even those I can identify, I don't know how to assess quality and worth.

Any tips? Resources? And once I get this sorted out, what are the best places to sell them? Etsy? FB Marketplace? I am also looking into vendor booths in SoCal (I also have everything tarot and Lenormand decks and books).
