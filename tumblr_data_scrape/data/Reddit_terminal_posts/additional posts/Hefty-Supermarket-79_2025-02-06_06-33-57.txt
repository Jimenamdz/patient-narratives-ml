Title: Reducing inflammation = stabilizing weight?

I am curious if those who got their inflammation down and just a great reduction in your autoimmune symptoms over all, if you find it is easier to deal with getting to a healthy, stable weight.

About 10 yrs ago, after 5 yrs of feeling good, stable weight, gaining muscle tone...I started dropping weight without trying. Too much. Then a few months later, suddenly started gaining. (Ended up being diagnosed with two types of SIBO...)

And have struggled to get it off ever since. Even with careful diet, getting SIBO symptoms under control, exercise, thyroid and hormones under control, increase protein, etc...

My rheum thinks it is that I have so much inflammation, that is the issue. It could explain things. And the last round of gaining weight coincides with the first symptoms of autoimmune disease...

So, I am curious if anyone has seen an improvement in this area. Whether losing after struggling to do so, despite doing all of the things, or gaining, after losing too much.

I'm not asking for dieting advice. Just curious if anyone has seen an improvement when they got their inflammation under control.

Edited to add: Due to having both lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, aka rhupus, I am on hydroxychloroquine. It definitely helped. But not enough. My lupus labs look so much better, but my inflammation is so bad. My face, hands, knees, shoulders, all so swollen...I tried 4 weeks of methotrexate, and that was a hell that I shall not repeat.

I just started Rinvoq this week ðŸ¤ž

I can't take prednisone, so I don't have those options. Sigh...
