I have lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. I'm on hydroxychloroquine and 6 days ago added in Rinvoq. I seem to have caught my child's cold. So far it's a sore throat and generally feeling extra blah and tired.

My rhem said zinc and vitamin C and other remedies are fine, except echinacea. I really need to kick this, as I have a client this weekend (I am a photographer). I can't reschedule (if at all possible, I obviously won't work if sick). I already had to reschedule her due to the nightmare that methotrexate put me through, and I was non functional when it was time for her session. She was totally understanding, but I don't want to do it again.

Plus, ZERO desire to be sick. I deal with enough health issues!

So far, I am drinking green tea, coconut water, chicken bone broth, taking zinc, oscillococcinum...
