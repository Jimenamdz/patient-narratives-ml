Title: Newbie! I have questions...

Content:
I've been on Rinvoq 15 mg for 10 days. I have a plethora of super fun health issues, but regarding autoimmune, I have lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (diagnosed in mid 2023, and I am 52, and am 2 years past having periods, for reference, in case it's helpful).

I also have EDS, SIBO, MCAS, IC, cEBV, and moved from the Seattle area to SoCal because I have cold urticaria and my body just hurts like a @$@%!!%!&$ most of the time in WA.

I'm on hydroxychloroquine, and it has helped my lupus, but not the RA massive inflammation. My rheum tried me on methotrexate, and I was so miserable, and we tried both oral and injections.

So, Rinvoq it is. My rheum also takes it and says most people begin feeling much better by 2 weeks...I would love to hear how soon it worked for others, and for those it does work for, does it just keep improving? 

My hands swell a lot, especially doing stuff around the house. And I have a lot of inflammation in my knees and face. And the past several days, my shoulders!

Anyway, my next question: NSAIDs. The pharmacist said acetaminophen only, because it can increase stomach issues if I take Rinvoq with NSAIDs...but I see so many posts about people being prescribed NSAIDs with Rinvoq...

Acetaminophen is not working and I could use some relief.

Last question. For those who struggled to lose weight due to inflammation related issues, did you find that once your inflammation was down with the help of Rinvoq, that you could lose weight, or at least have more control over your weight? (Every dr agrees that my not being able to lose weight is inflammation, because I literally do everything else, and yes, hormones, thyroid, diet, exercise, all in check.)

PS, I am not on prednisone. Steroids and I do not get along...
