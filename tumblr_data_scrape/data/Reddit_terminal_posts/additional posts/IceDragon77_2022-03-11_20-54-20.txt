Title: Is Symbiote Suit worth it?

Pros: +1 to every basic power, hand size, and +10 hit points is quite an upgrade.

Cons: It costs 4 though, and you get dealt an extra encounter card. 

My heart tells me the risk is well worth the reward. Probably works best with heroes that can ready themselves multiple times. Venom has Run and Gun, plus the 10 extra hit points means he can go longer with generating extra resources without having to flip to recover. 

Hmmm....
