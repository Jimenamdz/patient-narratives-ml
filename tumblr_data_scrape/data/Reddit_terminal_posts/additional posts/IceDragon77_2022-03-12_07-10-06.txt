Title: How do you date as a terminally ill person?

I'm a 31 year old male, and found out a few weeks ago that I have 1-2 years left (though my mom that I inherited my cancer from lived 7 years past her estimate). 

It might sound dumb considering there's more important matters to think about, but I really want to find somebody to love before my time is up. 

My mental health isn't doing so great, especially at night when I don't have things to distract myself and my brain doesn't want to turn off. Last week my friend spent the night and we cuddled, and I slept like a log, it was a miracle and I felt so refreshed. It felt like for the first time I was okay.

She has a boyfriend though, and while he's a real nice guy who was okay with her doing that, I don't want to keep asking her and putting a strain on their relationship.

So my main goals are to just meet someone, get to know them, have an impact on their lives, and cuddles would be great. Basically like that movie "The Fault in Our Stars"

Main problem is, I'm terrible at meeting people IRL. I'm an introvert. And online dating has become impossible. At first I just told people after a few days of chatting that I was terminal, and they ended up ghosting me. Then I tried putting it in my bio, and I don't get matches anymore (doesn't help that I'm pretty average looking).

So how the hell do I do this? How do I find my last shot at love? What would be the best way for your new date to tell you that they're terminally ill? Would you even want to know?
