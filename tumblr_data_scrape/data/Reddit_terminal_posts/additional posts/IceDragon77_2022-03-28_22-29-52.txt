Title: Anyone else having issues with rubber banding in multiplayer?

My friends say everything is fine when they play with each other, but when I join them, or they join me everyone starts rubber banding during combat.

I thought it might be an issue with my connection but my Xbox says I have an open NAT and I ran a speed test and everything looked fine.
