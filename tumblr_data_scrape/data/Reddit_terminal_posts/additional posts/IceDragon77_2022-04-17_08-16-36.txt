Title: Rule 0 has made me feel like a jerk on multiple occasions.

Anyone else feel like rule 0 is being taken too far?

I mostly play commander at my LGS with whoever decides to show up on any given friday night. I pay my entry, buy some snacks, and settle in for a night of 4 player shenanigans. Typically this is all smooth sailing.

However, the last couple months there have been hiccups.
I'm used to people using rule zero to ask about rough power levels of our decks so we're on the same page. That's perfectly fine with me! 

The problem is there have been people who use rule zero to break/bend rules. One person wanted to play cards with colour identities that don't match their commander. Another wanted to play silver border cards. Yet another wanted to play with banned cards. Sometimes it doesn't even come up during the pregame discussion, and it isn't until they play a card that I'll point out "you can't play that card." 

I get that some people play with their friend circles where rules are just a suggestion and then take the same deck to our LGS, but I really just want to play a normal game of commander. That IS what I signed up for. So I tell them no, they can't use those cards/decks. 

And while I feel horrible telling someone that they can't play their deck, I question why it's on me to uphold the rules of the game. To me it's no different than if someone started using modern cards in standard.

Since when did rule zero become the only rule that matters?
