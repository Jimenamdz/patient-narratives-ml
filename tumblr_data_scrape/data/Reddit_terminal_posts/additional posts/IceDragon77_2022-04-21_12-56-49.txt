So I have cancer and have been battling it for years.

During the fall of 2020 I was going through chemo after already having two surgeries. Everything seemed like it was going well. 

Then in February 2021, I was told that I'd need either more chemo or another surgery as they found cancer in my lungs.
I said I'd prefer the surgery if possible. They said they would get back to me.

Then I waited. And waited. And waited. Until late August, when I decided I had waited long enough, and phoned and asked what was going on with my treatment. 

"Oh it's a good thing you contacted us! We'll get you in for a CT scan and go from there"

Then I had another surgery this last November. It was supposed to be two surgeries but in February they told me there was no point in the second surgery as my cancer is now terminal.

I've had some time to wrap my head around it, and somewhat come to terms. But last night while I couldn't sleep a thought popped into my head.

"If I wasn't forgotten about, and had received treatment earlier last year, would I have avoided my cancer becoming terminal?"

And now it's all I can think about. Do I have a case? I don't know anything about laws and legal stuff. I'm probably just crazy and overthinking things due to stress, right?

Anyways I should try to at least get some sleep.
