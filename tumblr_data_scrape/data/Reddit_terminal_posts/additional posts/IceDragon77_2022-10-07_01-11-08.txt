Title: Dispute over damage deposit, anything we can do?

My friend and I just moved out of an apartment unit last week. I heard nothing about the damage deposit, so I sent a text and they told us we won't be getting it back.

They said they had to spend a whole day cleaning after we left, and that my cats destroyed the curtains that came with the unit, which means we won't see any of the $800 we paid.

I mean I won't argue about the living room curtains being damaged, but the curtains in both bedrooms were untouched. I had replaced mine with darker curtains when we moved in and stored the default ones in a closet, and my roommate never once allowed a cat into his bedroom due to his allergies.

As for the cleaning, how is that even calculated? They didn't hire cleaners so like can they even charge us with that? We cleaned the unit to roughly the state it was in when we moved in. Maybe we missed some spots but it's not like we left a huge mess. 

Feels like they're just trying to screw us over, but I'm obviously biased. Is there anything we can do? Am I allowed to ask for receipts totalling up to the $800?
