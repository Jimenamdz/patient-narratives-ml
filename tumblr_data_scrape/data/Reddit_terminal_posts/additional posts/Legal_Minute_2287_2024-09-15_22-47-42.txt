This was my third and fourth primary with breast cancer and Iâ€™m thrilled to be completing my last chemotherapy tomorrow. Treatment is not over for me. I will get 11 more doses of Keytruda over the next 11 months and then they want to do five years of Tamoxifen. HOWEVER, I am feeling thrilled to be completing the first part of this treatment plan. We must celebrate the small victories. Happy Sunday Everyone!
