Title: Making videos for younger family members.

I have a couple of months left. I have young siblings and nieces and I feel so awful that they have to lose a close family member this way so young. They all look up to me so much, especially my nieces. From a lot of people's suggestions, I've been making videos for certain milestones for my siblings and nieces, so I can be there for them in the times they're most likely to wish I was there. Things like graduations, weddings, birth of a first child. Trying to think of any other milestones/events that might deserve a video message. Any suggestions welcome.
