I have a couple of months left. My head feels like it's splitting open, no matter how many drugs they put in me. I'm confused most of the time. It's taking me so long just to write this and make it make sense. I used to be so smart and eloquent. Now I'm barely lucid. When I am I just want to find a way to die. I'm angry my state won't let me die with dignity and choice. My family shouldn't have to watch me suffer like this for more months.
