Title: So with amulet of rancour being a thing does that make making a amulet of torture higher priority?

I recall everyone saying the torture is just fashionscape and it should be made last of the zenny jewelry. I've made my ring and anguish, but once I get my 3rd zenny I've been heavily tempted to make a torture, and I have no real reason other than I guess fashionscape ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. But does the amulet of rancour add any max hits or is it a big enough upgrade from the fury to justify the loss in prayer bonus?
