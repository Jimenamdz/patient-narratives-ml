Title: Synapse, struggling with my decision

Content:
I'm contemplating the emberlight vs. the scorching bow. It's quite difficult because I know I will get more usage out of the emberlight, but the scorching bow also makes one specific grind quite mindless, that being kril. 

  
I haven't done a ton of research on kril and it's various methods outside of the scorching bow method that I saw. So let me say I currently know the 7:0 bandos method with bowfa, and I think I heard there's a bowfa method for kril as well, but if it's not as convenient as the bandos method I cba. I've seen a bit of good points for both options in other threads but I am still unsure. I'm close to 95 slayer so I need the hasta soon, and if I don't get the bow then I will probably stop kril ASAP once I get a hasta, but if I get the bow I will probably stay for all his drops. But outside of the kril grind I'm not aware of any other use for this bow as I already have a bowfa, and I am already shredding td's with demonbane and arclight.

  
So yeah. I guess I'm looking for someone who has experience with the kril grind potentially with and without the bow that can maybe vouch if it's worth sacrificing a synapse to make the grind easier. I plan on doing my greater demon tasks at tds till 99 slayer so I'm sure I'll get more than 1 synapse along the way, but I'm just preparing for when I get my first one, and if I get shit luck following it. 

  
Final point: The emerberlight would help me in my cerb tasks as I still need my prims, and it would convince me to start doing my abyssal demon tasks at sire, which would be cool because the abyssal slayer helm is my favorite in the game, so it would help achieve that goal. Plus not having to charge my arclight ever would be dope :)
