Title: Chess progression - My thoughts

I started playing chess 9 months ago and I started playing blitz at 400 elo and I dropped to > 290. Then I grinded to 600-700 and couldn't climb past that point after about a month of playing chess. Then I switched to rapid and climbed to 800 in rapid in 1 day, then it took me about a week or two to get past 900 elo. Then about 2-3 weeks 900 > 1000 in rapid.

  
Then 1000-1100 I struggled, 1100-1200 was the hardest elo I ever had to improve out of, then 1200-1300 was not as hard as the previous but still hard, then 1300-1400 elo was extremely easy? And now I'm 1450ish and I think I'm underrated I just haven't been playing much rated lately mostly unrated to refine my openings and just simply not playing a lot of chess. Yet every time I play I feel like I have improved since last time I played which makes no sense because I'm not even doing puzzles.

  
I almost feel like the shackles have loosened and I'm playing less static chess and more dynamic chess, where I will make moves like using pawn trades to improve my minor pieces activity, or trading my weaker minors for their stronger more active minors. I'm not rushing to win games, I'm fine playing 50+ moves to grind out a win through positional play etc. But these are all concepts I learnt through watching higher rated players but never knew how to actually execute, but now I feel like it's coming quite natural and I don't even really need to try to improve. Which makes no sense, when I was 1100-1250 I put in so many hours watching videos, playing games, grinding puzzles, yet saw little to no improvement, and then randomly things just click and now I feel like I could push 1500-1600 if I wanted to quite easily.

  
What are your guy's thoughts? I'm interested to hear some high rated players and see if maybe they had a similar experience? I'm just puzzled by this, it's like I'm putting in the least amount of effort in my chess climb, yet playing the best chess of my life?
