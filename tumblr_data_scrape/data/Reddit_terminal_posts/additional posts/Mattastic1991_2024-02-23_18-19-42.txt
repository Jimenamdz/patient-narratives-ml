I'm Matthew! I'm a stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer patient who's been fighting for as of February 22nd, 2 years!, and in those 2 years I've done 12 rounds of chemo and have become permanently disabled due to the damage and trauma my body has taken due to the cancer and treatments.  

I am making this post to hopefully reach out to people and hopefully receive assistance from anyone who can help donate to my gofundme that i have set up. This gofundme is used to help support me and my family,  that being me, my sister, her husband and my parents, who have all helped take care of me during these difficult times. 

Financially we are struggling even with me on Social Security and food stamps and my sister and her husband working, and we also have been struggling to repair our home which is slowly falling apart. When we moved in 2021, before i got sick, we were told nothing major was wrong and that our home warranty would help us, but during the summer of 2022, when i got sick with cancer, our Central Air went out and our warranty company refused to help us. 

We are also just simply struggling because of life and i am sure many of you understand that. I wanna be clear that i am trying to do this the right way. I understand that this is your money and if you don't trust me enough with it, I understand.  Please understand that I am doing the best I can. But even if you can't donate, is it possible to please at least share my GFM and hopefully it'll spread more! 


Thank you and I appreciate you reading this. 

I love u ❤️
