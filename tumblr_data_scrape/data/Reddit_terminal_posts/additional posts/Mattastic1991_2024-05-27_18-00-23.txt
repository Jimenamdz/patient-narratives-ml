So I've had this problem for a while and i can't figure out how to solve it. Xbox Series X and this happens in all games i play such as Destiny 2, Starfield, Fallout and what's pictured Broforce. Shadows have this weird grain effect and i have Game Mode on. Display is a Samsun CU8000 55. I made sure to also show my xbox settings. Im sorry to bug everyone with something that I could just ignore but man it's been bugging me that i just bought this TV and that i have to fight with it just to have a clean image ðŸ™ƒ  

Please and thank you ðŸ˜Š
