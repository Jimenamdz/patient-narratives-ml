Hello! 

So, i have been made fully disabled due to stage 4 pancreatic and liver cancer since my diagnosis in March of 2022. I went thru 12 rounds of chemo and have made it into remission and have been in remission since October of 2022. I still have to take chemo pills to act as maintenance and I'm also on pain pills to help with the chronic pain. 

Doc made it clear that I'm always going to be stage 4 since I cannot be cured and that I can't work and that no one can change that or take it from me...


However...with everything going on in the world and with election season being what it is..well, I'm just scared that I will lose my disability income and will have to somehow, someway go back to work even with my cancer issues, my type 1 diabetes that was a result of the cancer, and also my degenerative disc disease which my back is shot. 

I am scared because I do not want to put the responsibility onto my sister or my parents to have to help me even more than what they've been doing. It wouldn't be fair to make them have to do even more just to keep me alive and well when they have to suffer. I am scared because...I'm just flipping scared. 

I'm 33. And I am still adjusting to all this. I hope you all can understand where I am coming from.
