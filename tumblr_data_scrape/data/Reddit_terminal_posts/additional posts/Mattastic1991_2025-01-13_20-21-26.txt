Hello and greetings! 

I'll try to make this short and simple. I am dumb ðŸ™ƒ  ðŸ˜‚ basically, I had my PC made by Cyberpower back in 2018. 

Processor =  Intel(R) Coreâ„¢ Processor i7-8086K Limited Edition 4.00GHz [Turbo 5.0GHz] 12MB Intel Smart Cache LGA1151 (Coffee Lake) 

Graphics Card = GeForce(R) GTX 1080 Ti 11GB GDDR5X (Pascal)[VR Ready] [+401] (Single Card)

RAM = 32GB (8GBx4) DDR4/3200MHz Dual Channel Memory [+285] (Corsair Vengeance LPX

Motherboard = MSI Z370 GAMING PLUS ATX w/ RGB, USB 3.1, 2 PCIe x16, 4 PCIe x1, 6 SATA3, 1 M.2 SATA/PCIe [Intel Optane Ready]

I copy and pasted all this from the old receipt I had so I hope this helps. I don't need or want anything too huge!! Just any small upgrade I can make to hopefully enjoy some modern games at 1440p with high settings and 60 fps. I'm still learning alot of this and unfortunately it's extremely confusing and overwhelming and I don't wanna just blindly buy things with my limited funds since my only income is disability due to well, being a cancer patient :/ 

But please, if anyone can just point me in the right direction and help me out, I'd be most appreciative! I know some people have said I need to build a whole new system and I just...I can't. I love this PC because it really did help me during a bad time in my life so...yeah. 

Games I'm trying to play with better performance 

Mechwarrior 5 Clans
Helldivers 2
The Forever Winter 

And potentially some future titles. 

I apologize if this post is longer than it should be, I'm nervous asking but I'd rather hear from a community of people who know what they're doing rather than overwhelm myself with Google. 

Thank you in advance!!!
