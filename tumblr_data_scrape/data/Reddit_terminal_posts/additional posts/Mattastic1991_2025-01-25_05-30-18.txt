Oh boy...where do i start...


*Former Barber, 2022, 1 month after finishing chemo and being told im in remission*
"You need to drink baking soda and water to alkalize your blood and it will kill your cancer and cure you of type 1 diabetes!! Your oncologist is a quack and just wants your money" 

Okay but...I was just told im in remission and...

"NO NO DRINK THE BAKING SODA AND WATER AND YOU WILL BE CURED JOE ROGAN TOLD ME AND HE LOVES ME"

"If you just inject yourself with Ivermectin, you'll reverse your cancer and cure yourself of type 1 diabetes.  I've known many people who have done it and lived happylives! You don't need to take those drugs your oncologist has you taking" *this person is a nurse in a hospital* 



*other...random things from stupid people* 

"Cancer isn't real" 
"Just drink this magical tea that will make your cancer cells commit *UNALIVE* cause that is totally how it works"

"Well...you're in remission so you're cured. What do you mean no? You're a liar! I can't understand when someone is trying to explain how I'm wrong cause I'm dumb!" 

"Acupuncture will cure you" 

"You should listen to Joe Rogan!" 



There's others i can't remember...but yeah...these have been the ones that stick out. 

You try explaining to people that you have stage 4 and that you'll always have it even while in remission since ya know it had spread, but ya know...can't explain things to those who chose not to listen. 


Oh and yeah big pharma and my doctor is a vampire or something idk I stopped listening and was thinking about pizza.
