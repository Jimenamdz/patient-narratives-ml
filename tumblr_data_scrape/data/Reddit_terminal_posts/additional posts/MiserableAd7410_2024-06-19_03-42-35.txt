Had peg put in Monday. 
Had so much pain it was unbelievable. They did two further CT scans and said it was all in my mind, I am too sensitive etc. 
I have been through some serious pain in my 13 year cancer career and this is the worst. 

They put off my 1st immunotherapy because of it. Apparently I am the one at fault. Two days later I'm still in agony. I can only lie on one side but the pain is still there.

They refuse to admit or look for a problem. Instead they close ranks, isolate me in a different room and lecture me on how treatment is a gift from them. If I dont play ball they will refuse me treatment. Wtf?

I'm now attached to catheter, and other machines. I was only supposed to be here a few days, I drive myself here, pulled my 'luggage' up to the ward amd was really  looking forward to my palliative treatment to lessen the growing lumps in my head and neck.

Now I'm loosing weight, can hardly stand and honestly don't know how I'm getting out of here to fend for myself. 

Does this get better? I am even thinking of giving  up and asking for euthanasia....over a peg
