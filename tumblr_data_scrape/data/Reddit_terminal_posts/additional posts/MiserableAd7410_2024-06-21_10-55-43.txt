Title: How to deal with doctors who threaten you?

Undergoing immunotherapy treatment. 

I've had some quarrels with two palliative doctors over treatment. Silly things. I'm asking them to liase with the main cancer specialists who gave my recommendations for treatment. Theirs differe from the other hospital. 

Both doctors are in a huff being contradicted by a mere patient.

Both have said they have other patients and if I don't like it, go elsewhere. 

This is obviously scary as there is nowhere else. The other hospital is in another country. 

Any tips on how to break through their childish behaviour? 

Cheers
