I posted my full story so far if you want more background:

If you're not familiar with how cancer works, stage 4 is usually considered incurable and treatment is mostly used to maintain quality of life and control the disease from spreading. Somehow, despite the odds, I'm beating it.

I just thought I'd take the opportunity to either help fellow patients or spread awareness to those who don't know much about cancwr. Ask me anything :)
