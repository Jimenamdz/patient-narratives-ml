Title: The game isn't easy. A small % of you are just good at the game.

I just finished steward difficulty and it was hell for me. I felt like an idiot coz reading posts on this sub had me believing that the game is easy and I just suck.

Then I took a look at the steam achievements page and found out that:

Only 3% of players have finished steward difficulty

Only 1.4% of players have finished captain difficulty

And even on any difficulty, only 25% of players have finished the game.

Soooo. . No, the game isn't easy, especially from steward and above. For the vast majority of players, like myself, it's hard as hell. I had to play through it 5 times to get to the end. Some of you guys (1% of you) are just good at the game.
