Kind of a unique issue here, I hope you'll bear with me.

I've posted before on different subs about my condition. Basically, I have cancer (I'm fine, don't worry) and the treatment prevents my husband and I from having sex. People advised me to seek alternative ways to have intimacy to please him and they've largely worked (massage oil, toys, etc.).

Thing is, even before my diagnosis, I've always had trouble with his size. However, I was able to figure out various means to deal with it at the time when we were still having sex through changing positions, using lube, etc.

But it's different now since we can't have sex. While he's okay with the stuff I mentioned before, he's asking for oral a lot more often now (coz of my limitations). I've always been uncomfortable with it partially because I'm not that experienced but mostly because he's just big.

I've told him various times about this but he asks for it every time anyway, almost begging at times. I understand, of course, coz he's had to suppress his desire in consideration of my condition. He has never complained about it.

When I try to give him oral, I frequently gag and it feels really uncomfortable. Fortunately, when this happens, he stops me and apologizes, and we just try to do some other thing. Still, the next time we do something, he asks for it again, and the cycle continues.

How do I communicate to him that I don't want to do oral anymore, or is there some way for me to make this more comfortable?
