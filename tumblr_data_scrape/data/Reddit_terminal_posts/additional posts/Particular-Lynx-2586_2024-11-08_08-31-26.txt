Title: My best blood numbers in years! (Kicking cancer's ass)

I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer (terminal) almost 4 years ago. It had spread to my pituitary gland, spinal cord, and adrenal gland (full story in my profile).

Recently, scans showed that most of the tumors have disappeared while the one in my pituitary is stable. Then today, I got my most recent blood numbers and my white blood cells and platelets are the best they've ever been!

The platelets are still below the normal range but when I've been struggling with bleeding for so long, seeing that 3 digit number is amazing for me.

Spreading hope to other patients out there. :)
