Title: Did Palpatine's death in episode 6 cause the empire to lose the battle?

I'm debating between 2 schools of thought:

1. Palpatine was so powerful that he was directing the space battle manually as he sat on his chair, using the force to control the commanders/ships. This is why the empire was "winning" while he was still in control and they started "losing" as he got increasingly distracted by the Vader/Luke fight. That would mean that had Vader not killed the emperor, the empire would have won the battle.

Or

2. Palpatine wasn't really in control of the battle outside and the empire was just winning at the start due to the surprise advantage. The rebels started winning on their own regardless and the emperor's death had no influence on the battle whatsoever. That would mean it was just as Luke said, that Palpatine's weakness was his overconfidence.

I'm about to explain this to my daughter, who's asking me this irritatingly good question. What do you guys think?
