Solo, Rogue One

We started with Solo and Rogue One not for story reasons. I wanted her to have a positive first impression of the series from a tech point of view (she's a kid, exposed to great graphics, I was afraid episode 4 would look too "antique" for her) and I also wanted her first dip into the series to be not-so-serious.

Episode 4-5

So we didn't start with episode 1 because obviously I wanted her to have the "I am your father" moment unspoiled and it worked. She was completely "O" faced.

Episode 1, the Mandalorian, then 2-3

Then we went to the prequel trilogy to provide context with the Mandalorian squeezed in between 1 and 2 for Fett. I personally think that 1-3 aren't all bad, particularly for worldbuilding and getting the kids engaged.

Ending with episode 6

I really wanted to end everything with episode 6 and leave it at that. 6 ends so perfectly and caps the story so well and I don't want to ruin it with the Disney shenanigans. If she wants to see 7-9 in the future, that's on her.
