Title: Would Luke have joined the dark side if Palpatine had just shut his big mouth?

All this (ham) stuff seems to just push Luke away from the dark side even more as saying them made Luke realize what he's doing. Every time he talks, Luke stops attacking:

"I can feel your anger" *turns away from palpatine*
"Strike me down and your journey towards the dark side will be complete" *turns away from palpatine*
"Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you" *stops attacking Vader 'i won't fight you father'*

And just as Luke was about to strike Vader down:

"Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!" *looks at his hand and stops fighting 'i am a Jedi, like my father before me'*

I mean. . If you're so mad yet some guy keeps narrating how mad you are. . You'd feel less mad, right? I think Luke would've finished Vader if Palpatine hadn't kept reminding him of his hatred.
