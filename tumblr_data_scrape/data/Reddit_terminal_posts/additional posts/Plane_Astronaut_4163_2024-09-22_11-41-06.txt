I did a pet scan about a month ago and it shows the cancer has now reached my lungs and liver. Well they don’t know if it’s cancer on the liver but I have multiple masses. My oncologist dropped me as a patient so now I’m stuck looking for a new one. Most of the doctors I’ve spoken with has really pushed for hospice. I don’t know what to do or where to turn to. I’m turning 32 on the 28th of this month and I’m not even excited about it. I’m constantly in pain and my oncologist that dropped me didn’t understand how I could be in so much pain. It’s just a lot to take on and I didn’t plan for any of this. I’m truly lost
