So I completely forgot that yesterday was 3 years since I got diagnosed with Stage 4 Ewing's Sarcoma. It was overshadowed by the fact that I tested positive for covid!! So that kind of took all my attention haha. My chemo has now been delayed by 2 weeks (since I was supposed to have treatment tomorrow). Oh well. 

I guess I just want to mark it because apparently the 5 years survival for metastatic Ewing's is (on average) around 37%. I don't really know if I'll beat those odds, but just another 2 years to go, and I'm still doing (relatively) well. So here's hoping.
