Title: I hate how Richard is so obsessed with his Yale years

Maybe I'm being a bit too negative here. I'm watching episode 4x09 (Ted Koppel's Big Night Out) - the one where the Gilmores go to see the Yale vs Harvard football game.

And Richard just keeps going on about his time at Yale: when him and his friends forced a guy out of his residence by basically bullying him every day, when he said he was naked for basically all of his sophomore year (in protest). Then he joins in and sings songs with the current students at the game (these men are in their 20s - why is this random old man coming up to sing with them in a parking lot).

He is obviously longing for his old glory days at Yale. It just reminds me of this awful pretentious, old money, frat boy, toxic masculinity, glory days mentality that prestigious universities give some people, and makes me like Richard even less (and my bar for Richard is very low already).

I think it just shines a light on the "boys will be boys" thing that was more prevalent back then (although still is today). I guess it's not that deep, but I just think he's a bit sad.

Edit: I maybe am a bit dramatic in this post, but I still stand by it. I just think Richard trying to glorify his old, immature ways shows a lack of character growth, that's all. I am sorry to anyone I have offended - there is nothing wrong with loving your college ðŸ˜­ it's just Richard that I have an issue with.
