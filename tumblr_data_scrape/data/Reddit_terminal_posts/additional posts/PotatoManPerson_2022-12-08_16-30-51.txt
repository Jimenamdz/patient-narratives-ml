Having a bit of a moan. I'm incurable. Not ideal - it is what it is. 

Anyway, I have Ewing's Sarcoma, a relatively rare bone cancer that about 1 in a million people will be diagnosed with each year. I *hate* when people tell me that I should have hope because "science is always advancing" or something, and cancer treatments are always improving. 

That may be true for common cancers, but when you have a cancer as rare as mine - it just isn't true. They don't do enough research on it. They don't have enough patients to do the research on it. It really feels like rare cancer patients are left behind in the research - because they are I guess. It's not the fault of the researchers, obviously you're going to work more on the cancers that affect more people. It just sucks.

Anyone else with a rare cancer get told this? Would love to hear others give out about it lmao.
