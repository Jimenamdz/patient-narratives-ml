Title: Anyone else experience nasty side effects from zoledronic acid?

Hi everyone, I've been having pretty bad back pain for a while, but CT and MRI scans haven't shown any cancer there. So my oncologist put me on zoledronic acid to strengthen my bones because they think it could be due to bone loss. 

I had my first dose of it on Tuesday (along with my first dose of a new chemo), and the next day my back was THROBBING. I was feeling achey in my chest, ribs and back. My temperature was rising for a bit but then went back to normal eventually. The pain felt very similar to the back pain i get when I take neulasta, so that's what makes me feel like it was related to the zoledronic acid, and not just my regular back pain. 

And it feels now like I have a big knot in my mid-back that needs to be massaged. Not fun. 

Anyone else get side effects like these?
