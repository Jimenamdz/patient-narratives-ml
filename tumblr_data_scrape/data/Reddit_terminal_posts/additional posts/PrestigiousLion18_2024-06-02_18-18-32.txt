It pisses me off so much how doctors keep saying that Sarcoma cancers are so rare, but more and more people are getting this type of cancer each day yet not enough research is being done to beat this damn disease. 

I don't think it's a rare disease, I think it's just the carelessness of these researchers/doctors bc not enough money is being poured into research.
