Title: Ki Mobility Rogue 2 wheelchair

A couple of years ago, I ordered a Ki Mobility Rogue 2 wheelchair. When I got fitted for the chair and placed the order, the technician asked me if I wanted foldable push handles. I told him no bc I thought I wouldn't need them. I now realize that after already having my chair delivered and using it quite a bit, I would've actually liked the option of having them just in case I get tired of pushing myself from time to time.

So I got a question, would it be too late to contact the manufacturer and ask them to modify my chair and equip it with foldable/collapsible push handles? If I'm not able to contact them, and have them do it, can add it later myself and what brand of push handles should I go for if it is possible to add them myself?
