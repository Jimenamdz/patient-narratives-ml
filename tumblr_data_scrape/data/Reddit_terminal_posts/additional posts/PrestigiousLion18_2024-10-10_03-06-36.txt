So I've been looking into buying a smart watch to pair with my android phone. I found this smart watch on eBay and I reached out to the seller to see if they could answer a few questions like, can it act like an Apple Watch that's paired to an iPhone? Meaning can it get notifications from other apps on my phone and display them on the watch, can I make phone calls from the smart watch and get text message alerts on the watch as they come through from my android phone and lastly, am I able to pair Apple Airpod Pros to the smart watch via Bluetooth?

Needless to say, I haven't gotten any response from the eBay seller, so I'm jumping on here to see if anyone else had any luck with it and could offer some help/advice.

This smart watch is essentially a mini android phone from what I can gather, so it shouldn't be an issue. But still, if anyone can offer any insight before I make the plunge, that would be great.

Here's a pic of the smart watch in question
