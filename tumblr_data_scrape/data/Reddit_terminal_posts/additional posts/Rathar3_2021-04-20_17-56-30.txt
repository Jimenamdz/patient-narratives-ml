Ok so just called a heath care supplier to get a cane. I need a cane for when i am on chemo cause i am unsteady and wobble like a bowl of jello in a paint shaker. So the girl asks about my health insurance and i have state medicaid since i am disabled. She informed me due to having state insurance i cannot SELF PURCHASE a cane thru a medical supplier! I can go to walgreens CVS wal mart and get one but i want one that i can trust to not break.

I laughed for 20 minutes on the phone. And since i told them and gave them info now i cant even just buy  it. SO i called my little brother and he went and got me one.

I mean really?
