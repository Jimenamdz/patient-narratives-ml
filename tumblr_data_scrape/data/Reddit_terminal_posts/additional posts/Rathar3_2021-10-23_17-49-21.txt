I started this a few months ago about 80% done. Using a DLE 20 for the motor and some 180 oz hitec servos.

Had several issues with the plans/ instruction not matching up with the wood sent. Over all its a nice kit but not something recommended for some whos not built several kits.

Going to cover with cub yellow oratex and sig yellow for the other parts. Got the cowl from Fiberglass specialties with the dummy engines.

Will post more when i get more done.
