Today was my 33th chemo cycle. I went back and counted them all up to make sure. I was off but got it right and after the PETG scan looks like many more to do.

My tumor is my throat which is 11/2 inches long is still same size but the density decreased a lot. The lymph nodes are still clear no tumors showing. Was told i am responding well to Chemo so they changed my chemo up too florouracil by pump every 2 weeks and one dose of Oxalipatin once a month. (they are doing this due to nephropathy in feet/fingers.

Overall its looking better i hate the PETG scans then waiting for the results. I told my brother every one is like someone standing behind you with 1 shell in the cylinder 5 empty and they pull the trigger you one day its going to go off. I am Terminal so its just a matter of when.   Sorry for the ending rant but its just nerve racking waiting and not knowing.
