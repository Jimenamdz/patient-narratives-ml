After 36 chemo treatments my cancer became resistance to the chemo. They started me on a new treatment thats a bio drug that seems to be working but who knows. After this there is nothing but hospice care.

Its been a bad ride i fill up with fluid due to my lymph nodes being full of cancer so every 2 weeks they put a tube in my abdomen wall and pump out the fluid. the levels have been dropping so they think that its working but when it stops this will be the norm.

I have been told this is my last year. I have taken care of my funeral and all arrangements are done. It's strange sitting with a funeral director while i am still alive and do all this but it needed to be done.

I have not given up i am just dealing with reality that there is no hope but that does not mean there is no life. I will keep fighting the monster till it i wins.

But it's going to have to fight me to the end!
