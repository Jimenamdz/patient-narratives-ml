Yesterday i meet yet another Karen in the wild and it didn't end well for her. At 57 i have met a few and i never hold back.  So info about me i have stage 4 cancer that's incurable i have done many chemo treatments that have ravaged my body and mind. My time is coming to a end and to be honest i just don't care anymore.

I asked my Dr for a handicapped parking pass due to some days i feel really weak have issues walking far. Our social worker at the cancer center got me one that very day. ( i guess they can give them out)

Anyway the very first time i used it i was at the grocery store getting some food. I Parked in the handicapped spot and started walking in And this 40 something woman asked me why i parked there.

I said i have a permit that's all you need to know and walked away. She said I demand to know how someone that's healthy can just do that.  I said i am not and just went inside. 

She marched up to me and said I called the cops you are getting a ticket you are lazy and disgusting.

I Looked at her and asked her if she was going to waddled back to the herd and start grazing or was she ready for the slaughter house. The look on her face was pure shock. I said well when heifers are at her age they are either turned out to pasture or are shipped off for processing.

One employee i knew came over told her to leave me alone that i had cancer and they called the manager over. She was escorted out of the store and told not to come back EVER!!

Yes the cops came and they talked to me. I explained everything and they said they were sorry i said no biggie and went and got my stuff.

I hate Karen's !!
