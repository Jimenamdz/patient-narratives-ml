Hey everyone!

Me again, feeling a little sad today. I have my appointment this Wednesday to find out my latest PET scan results and new treatment plan for my relapse. It would be my fourth treatment now and I’m running out of my options. 

My breathing is starting to get impacted and it’s definitely starting to feel downhill from here which we knew was coming as it’s incurable but it doesn’t make it hurt any less. 

I’m 24 and live with the love of my life and our three cats, they’re my whole world and I don’t want to leave. I can’t stop thinking about how I don’t get to grow old with my partner and how this is going to be so hard for him. I’m also selfishly thinking a lot about how I won’t be his big life partner one day, someone else will come along and eventually they’ll have spent more time together. He deserves the very best and I want that for him but I’m just so angry that isn’t me. 

Currently curled up next to sleeping partner and one cat ( the other two are zooming around the house) and I feel so grateful to have such an awesome family but I’m just devastated. 

Thanks for listening. Fuck cancer. I still have so much fight to give and it’s just not working for me.

** update: thank you to everyone for commenting I really appreciate it, sorry we are all in this mess. Sending all my love. 

To those sending me bogus health advice on private message… go away!!!
