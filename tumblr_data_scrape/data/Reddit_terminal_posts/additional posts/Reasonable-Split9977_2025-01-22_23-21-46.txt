Me(24F) again! Hope everyone is having the best day they can. 

Got news yesterday that PET scan showed some fluid in the pleural space on my right lung. Not enough to remove yet but Iâ€™m due to be starting another chemo hopefully next week or the week after. Has anyone seen improvement in this kinda thing from their treatments? 

Thank you, any help is appreciated x
