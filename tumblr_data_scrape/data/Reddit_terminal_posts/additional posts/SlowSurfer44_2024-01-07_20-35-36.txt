I had a MRI protocol done so the rectal surgeon can see exactly how much he needs to cut out but my primary tumor is all but gone so are the spots in my liver are also all but gone. It's great news they will do 5 days of intensive radiation to make sure the primary is completely gone if that works only liver surgery and lungs. 
My liver surgeon is just going to just cut and burn the area the 3 spot were at to make sure its totally gone as well. 
After I recover I will have surgery to get rid of my one lung met. My liver surgeon says I'm in the best possible position to beat this. I have not had any new mets when I found out (April 2023) to when I started treatment in July. I'm very optimistic that I will beat this I have so far responded very well and my primary and my liver are pretty much cleared. I know I still have a ways  to  go but do far things are looking great! Keep me in your thoughts and prayers.
