Title: How can I draw the atoms of Hydrogen, Oxygen, Carbon and Nitrogen in the simplest, most minimalist and scientifically accurate way?

My understanding is that these 4 elements are both the most common in the universe and the 4 most basic and essential building blocks of life. I wish to get a tattoo of these 4 elements that is accurate and as simple as possible (and not in letters of the periodic table). [I found this example of a minimalist tattoo of a Hydrogen atom.](https://www.tattoodo.com/p/724755) Could you draw or send a link of the other 3 elements drawn in the same fashion? I'm finding a lack of coherence with these other more complex atoms when I search online hence why I need advice.

This type of request may be uncommon, but I am finding myself in an uncommon situation with not much time left before I die and getting an accurate tattoo celebrating the building blocks of life as we know it is on my bucket list. Please help make this happen.
