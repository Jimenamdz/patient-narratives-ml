Title: Guides for takeoffs

Could someone please point me to some decent guides (workflow) for doing takeoffs / estimates.

My health took a dive (cancer) so I can't build anymore but my bosses are awesome and came up with this as a way to be productive.

I quite tech savy so am picking up custom tools and the like quickly in Bluebeam but translating that information into well presented useful information is something I would like to shorten the learning curve on.

I have survived watching a couple hours of videos by Bluebeam and that was horrible. Had PTSD from my time in corporate life.

Thank you for any guidance.
