I have terminal colon cancer and am on protocol #2 of chemo. My wife is wonderful but leans more towards herbal remedies and wants me to keep an open mind about naturopathic solutions. I am all for taking a couple extra pills to keep her happy while dying over the next couple years.

What I can't handle for that long is her idea that because mushrooms and other natural things are free no one investigates them because they can't make money off them. And that overall treating cancer "the western way" isn't actually looking for a solution.

Can some of you smart people point me to some things to read to help me show her the light. All I have so far is  "wife, that's crazy"

Respectfully, if you believe as my my wife does please hit the back button and don't chime in on this

Edit: Thank you to everyone for all the excellent answers I will definitely be using a bunch of them in the upcoming heart-to-heart
