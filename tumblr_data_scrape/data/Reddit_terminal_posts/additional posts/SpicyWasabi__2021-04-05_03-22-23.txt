Title: Advice for sending irl packages

Hi everyone! I’m about to exchange a real life mail package with one of my penpals who I’ve had for about two years now. To get to the point, we wanted to send each other some cool things or just overall knickknacks from our personal countries. I won’t expose where my penpal is but she’s from the South America region so she’ll be sending me some cool things but I’m so lost on what to send! I’m from Japan so I’m thinking of sending some interesting things like snacks, rare mangas (she loves reading them), and other items but I’m just so lost. I want to make it special because this package is gonna take a loooong time to send as well. Has anyone ever sent irl things to their penpals? If so, what did you send? 

Thanks :)
