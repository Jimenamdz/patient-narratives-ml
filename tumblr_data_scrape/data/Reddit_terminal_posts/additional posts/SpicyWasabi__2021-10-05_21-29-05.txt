Title: Receiving a letter from a country I’ve excluded

I’m sure everyone knows that in Slowly you’re able to exclude up to 5 countries (10 if you’re PLUS) for personal preference or whatever. I personally excluded about 7 that I receive lots of spam and annoying letters from so I just prefer it that way. Anyways, I look on slowly and it seems that I’m receiving two letters, both from a country that I’ve excluded a long time ago. It’s not like I excluded their country after they sent me the letter, it’s been a while since I first excluded them. How is this possible? Did they somehow spoof their location just to send me a letter or something? Has anyone else experienced this?

UPDATE: I received the letter today and with the advice of another user, looked at the top to see it was sent from the location I had excluded meaning that they somehow bypassed my filter without VPN or anything like that. I emailed Slowly and they said it must’ve been a glitch, but that’s all I’ve got 🤷🏻‍♀️
