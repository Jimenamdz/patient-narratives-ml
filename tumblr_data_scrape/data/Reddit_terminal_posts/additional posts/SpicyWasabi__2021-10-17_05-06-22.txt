So, I’ve just finished season 10 and was immensely let down. I started Shameless in early September on season 1 and just finished season 10 today so it should show you how engaged and in love I was with the show. This season has just felt really boring and mundane and a lot of my friends and other people have mentioned that season 11 is no better and in fact, worse. I might watch the last episode of Season 11 for my sake but unsure if I should even give it a try as I can’t put myself through another 12 episodes of boredom.
