Title: Everyone seems just fed up with me having cancer

Content:
I’m HBC, first diagnosed in 2019, by now recurrence and stage IV (bone mets).
I know that I haven’t been easy to be around. I can get very angry, desperate and act out…. I don’t even recognize myself anymore. I’m trying to tell my family and friends what I need and wish they could do for me. I have been in counseling for years and just learning how to voice my problems and how to tell them that I need help.
By now it seems like nobody takes me seriously anymore. If I say that I’m in pain for example, my partner might say something like “yeah I know, I have a headache too.” Or “yada yada we all know you’re not well, just for the sake of everyone, shut up.” 
I don’t have the impression that I’m very needy or that I complain a lot. Quite the contrary since I have the feeling that I don’t say a lot about my pain, about my cancer all together. But if I do, I get loads of negativity thrown towards me. My partner keeps telling me that I can’t make the cancer responsible for everything and that I can’t ever mention it in an argument because it’s one he can never win.
I don’t know how to act, what do you do in situations like these?
