Well, we didn’t have a great couple of years. I was first diagnosed with bc in October 2019, my then 11yo was diagnosed with lymphoma in January 2020. I had surgery, radiation therapy and was put on tamoxifen, my 11yo was stage III and had to go through several rough rounds of chemotherapy, was in and out the ICU,… it was a nightmare. Well… and the day my then 12yo rang the bell, I had a biopsy and found out that I had a recurrence.
I was in and out hospitals but I mainly stayed with my kid, no matter my own diagnosis. My kid wasn’t even back in school when I had a mastectomy and was put on AI and stuff. 
By now I have the worst flashbacks and panic attacks whenever I have to go to the hospital or have to go to the hospital with my kid. 
When I had to stay for a night because of a standard procedure last year, I totally lost it in the ER and demanded that my partner stays with me over night. I was terrified to be left alone there. I cried and panicked and couldn’t stop hyperventilating. Now I have to do more surgeries in fall and I really don’t know how to manage that. 
I’m in therapy ofc, I take my meds, I see my psychiatrist and a shrink + go to group sessions. 
Still, the only thing I’m worried about is having to stay overnight in the hospital by myself. I don’t care about the surgeries, the pain, nothing like that. But having to sleep in those hospital sheets, the smell of the sheets,… it gives me the shivers. I know that it doesn’t make any sense…. So I hope that one of you knows what I’m talking about here…
