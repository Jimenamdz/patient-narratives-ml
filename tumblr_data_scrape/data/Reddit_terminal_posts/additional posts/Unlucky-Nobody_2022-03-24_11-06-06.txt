4 month update since diagnosis. I started two chemo and one immunotherapy drugs shortly after Christmas and today I had my 4th cycle. pemetrexed carboplatin and Pembrolizumab 

On Monday I had a restaging CT scan and yesterday I had an oncology appointment yesterday. Apparently the treatment is going well lymph nodes have shrunk so good news is they think they can keep me around for a full 2 year treatment so yay good news. Two years of chemo every three weeks is less great news but it beats the alternative at this point. At least from here on they are dropping the carboplatin
