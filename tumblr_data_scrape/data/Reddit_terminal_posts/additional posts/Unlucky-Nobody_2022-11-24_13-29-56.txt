 A year ago I (40M) found a lump in my neck that turned out to be a rare aggressive sarcoma in my lymph nodes, lungs, one adrenal gland and liver. I was started on treatment fairly promptly with a fairly poor prognosis. Honestly, I didn't expect to still be here at this point but modern medicine can work wonders.

The treatment I'm on is pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and pemetrexed every three weeks. Today I had number 12 of 36 treatments. I also had 4 doses of carboplatin. The results have been better than anyone expected and with fairly minimal side effects, mostly fatigue.

After about 6 months of being emotionally broken from the news life weirdly returned to something resembling normal. Things have slowed down a lot and I have learnt to take pleasure in the little things as much as possible. I'm still out learning new skills making connections and sharing experiences. I know when I get the news it's returning It's going to break me again but that is a problem for later. My friends and family have been my rocks and this sub has given me some perspective on how much harder some of you do it and my heart goes out to all of you!

I think that's all I have to say for now. This is partially just a rant, a little for posterity. If anyone has questions feel free to ask.
