35/35 infusions of Keytruda and pemetrexed every three weeks for 2 years. Today I'm finally done,

I was diagnosed September 21 with aggressive sarcoma in my lungs liver adrenal glad and lymph nodes, My treatment was started very soon and I have been extremely lucky to have had a complete response.

My side effects have bee really tolerable. I get enema in my feel and a little neuropathy fatigue and sore eyes are the big ones, minor overall. who knows what will persist,

I'm not out of the woods yet they want to leave my port in for likely future treatments but for now I have the all clear and I'm not on any treatment. It feels weird and scary. I'm not sure I'm ready for this new chapter.
