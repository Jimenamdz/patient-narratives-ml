This is one of two crazy quilts she made this size.  This one was made for my sister and another was made for me. Sadly my sister has an intellectual disability and has no interest in keeping mums work. This was taken two months before she died of cancer. This day the quilt was gifted to the woman on the right. I'll post photos of mine when I can get to it.
