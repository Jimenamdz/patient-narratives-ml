Hello, so i've been with my boyfriend for about a year now, and we have been okay.. but as time went on my bpd flared up more and more and im not gonna sugar coat it, i was verbally abusive to him multiple times. we are currently talking but very little, and are going to call next week to talk things through. we are long distance too

  
he's reiterated that he doesnt  want this relationship to end, and hes also stated that he doesnt want to lose his attachment to me because of my lashing out. I've been on a waiting list for therapy (NHS lists.. sigh)

  
im trying not to freak out and spam text him while we take this space. it feels like abandonment when its not, and it sucks so hard because we share friend groups. I dont know what to do, ironically im the one who suggested it so i know deep down its good for us but on the other hand what if he loses his bond with me? im scared man.
