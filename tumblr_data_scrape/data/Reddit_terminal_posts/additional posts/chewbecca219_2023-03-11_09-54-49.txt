Stage 1b triple+ May 2021. NED since November 2021. Found tumor in brain 2 weeks ago. Isolated, CR of body good, need bone scans. Removed tumor March 1. Doing ok, headaches are awful and one put me in ER. 
Can anyone share their brain met story, what treatments etc? I start radiation on the affected area in a week- 5 sessions. Then meet with onc to discuss TCP and enhertu. Iâ€™m heartbroken to no longer be curable. How did you deal with post craniotomy pain? The headaches are awful. What worked for you in second round of treatment? Xoxo
