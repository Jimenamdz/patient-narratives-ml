Title: Fiance has stage 4 cancer with 1-5 years to live so what can I do to do something for myself? What are you doing to keep sane or a hobby or anything else if and when your partner passes you aren’t just done.

What are you all doing to prepare for your partner to die? I have read you need to do something for yourself. I have Mondays and Tuesdays I could do something after work. I am not religious. I’m really open to any ideas of what you have done or are doing outside the house if you are a homebody and only rely on your partner for support. I don’t have family other than him and our super small kids. I know I need to develop something for myself so when my world falls apart I can rely on something. Tia
