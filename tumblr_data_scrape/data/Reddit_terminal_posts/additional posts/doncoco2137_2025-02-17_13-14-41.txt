Title: Flaky dandruff problem

Hey everyone,  

I've been struggling with persistent dry dandruff for over a year now, and I just can't seem to get rid of it. It’s constantly flaking from my beard, hair, and even my eyebrows looking like snow all the time. No matter what I do, it just keeps coming back.  

I've tried multiple anti-dandruff shampoos, oral antifungal medication, and even apple cider vinegar treatments for a while. I wash my face once a day (not too much), and I wash my hair every 3–4 days, making sure not to rub or move my scalp too much. Despite all this, the dandruff never stops.  

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Any advice or solutions that actually worked for you? I’d really appreciate any help!
