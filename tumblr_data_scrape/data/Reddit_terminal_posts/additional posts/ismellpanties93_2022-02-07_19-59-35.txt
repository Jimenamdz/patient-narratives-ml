Hi cancer fam. I just needed to type this out as I’m low key freaking out and I don’t want to talk to anyone who doesn’t get how this can feel sometimes. 

I’m scared shitless that my treatment isn’t working, because I’ve felt really good this time and I’m not ready to get bad news again. 

I’ve had a good break since October, no scans, no checkups, just chemo every 4 weeks. It’s been so nice. And I’ve allowed myself to believe that this treatment might just have an effect. 

But what if it doesn’t? 

I’m 28, I know I’m terminal, but I just want something, anything to work just a little bit. This is my 5th line of treatment, nothing has worked before this and I can’t help feeling like I’ve been naive and stupid for even thinking that anything could work. 

I’m just having a really hard time right now. I feel like screaming.

All day I’ve been so tired I’ve just been sleeping and doing nothing, I’ve barely eaten and I just feel completely deflated. 

Sorry for the long rant but I know this is a safe space and I don’t know who else to talk to right now. Thanks for hearing me out.
