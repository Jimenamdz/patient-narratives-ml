While I still have a hell of a fight ahead of me, my PET scan results came back today, and the cancer is localized, and has not spread!  It has been a steady month or so of bad news.  This puts me in the fight, and that’s all I need!  Time to kick the shit out of this tumor with chemo and immunotherapy until it shrinks down enough that a surgeon can rip it the fuck out!  Funny part is, that will be the first set of stitches I have ever received!  Made it almost 40 years without incident.  My oncologist was passing by the waiting room and saw us, and just instantly lit up and waved.  Now we know why!  Session two for the chemo is Friday.  This tumor doesn’t know what it’s in for!
