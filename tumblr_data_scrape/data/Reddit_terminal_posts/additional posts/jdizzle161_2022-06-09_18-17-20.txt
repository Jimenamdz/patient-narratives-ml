Title: Replace or repair heat pump/ac?

I bought my house in 2017.  The seller replaced the heat pump/ac unit completely with a Coleman unit in 2016.  He purchased a ten year extended warranty, but Coleman looked up the sales history of the house and voided it when they saw it was sold in 2017.  Long story short, this six year old unit has now died twice on me.  In 2018, it was one circuit board, and now it’s the larger one.  It’s going to cost me $2,200 to replace.  This feels like something that is going to keep happening every few years.  So now I am trying to decide if it is going to be worth it to replace the entire unit.  I was quoted at $18,600, but they also have a plan that covers the unit price, installation, all regular maintenance (including filters) and all repair costs both parts and labor.  This would run about $250 a month, over the course of ten years.  


What would you all do?  Repair and hope for the best, replace (which I would have to finance), or do their $250 a month program?


Ps.  NEVER BUY A COLEMAN!
