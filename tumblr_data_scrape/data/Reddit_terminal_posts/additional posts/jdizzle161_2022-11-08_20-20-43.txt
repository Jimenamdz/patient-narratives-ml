Title: I need the Jersey jersey font type!

I want to make Vans custom "Shoe" shoes to go with the Jersey jersey, and Hat hat.  Still not a huge fan of the third jerseys, but the three combined is something I can rock.  I just can't find anything like that font, and need to create the "Shoe" in it on a black background to upload to the Vans site.
