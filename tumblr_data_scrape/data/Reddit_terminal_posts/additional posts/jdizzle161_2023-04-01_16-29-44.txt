Slapshot is one of my favorite movies.  The actor who played one of the Hanson Brothers had been fighting cancer.  He put out a Chiefs (hockey team from the movie) Hockey Fights Cancer jersey.  I had to get it.  I got to have a half hour long zoom session with him while he signed it.  Just came in the mail today.  I am so excited!  I love it, and just wanted to share!  The good days are so necessary, and today is shaping up to be a great one!
