Title: Got handed my death sentence yesterday, but I am not done yet!

Content:
7 months of chemo, and we shrunk this tumor down (cholangiocarcinoma), but it wouldn’t break free from the artery.  15 doses of radiation leading to the worst pain in my life, and a week in the hospital on morphine, and it still wouldn’t break away.  Now it has spread.  Abdomen, skin, and I’m going to get a scan to see if it’s in my bones today.  Going on Folfox to buy time, and looking into every clinical trial world wide!  My doctor said that if the folfox works, I have about a year.  If it doesn’t, six months.  My wife is crushed.  I don’t know how to help her.  All I have for her is that I have zero quit in me, and I am a stubborn mother fucker!  I’m taking it day by day, not worrying about tomorrow.  I’m still standing, and will fight until the very last breath.  The part that hurts is not being able to help her.  The part that is crushing is looking at my 8 year old son.  We haven’t told him yet.  We want all the information first.  He is already seeing a therapist (who he loves), so she will start working with him with this all in mind.  

I have not shed a single tear.  Not in the beginning (last year), and not now.  I just get more stubborn.  

I love this sub, because it is a great place to vent something like this, and hear from people going through the same thing.


All I have left in this rant is a simple notion.  A basic slogan I have been screaming since the beginning. 

FUCK CANCER!
