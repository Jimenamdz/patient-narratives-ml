Title: Side effects really dragging on me!

Been fighting bile duct cancer for 1.5 years now.  That spread into my abdomen and spleen.  A week and a half ago, I took a spill, and they found that it has traveled to my brain.  Today is session 4 of ten.  The side effects are what’s really dragging me down.  I can’t hear out of one ear, my voice is so scratchy I can barely talk.  I have trouble eating.  I’m so hungry, but it takes so much work to eat.  I feel like I spend most of day mushing up food in my mouth.  I get this weird flem feeling in the back of my throat every time I try to eat or swallow, and I carry around an empty bottle to spit it in when I can’t hold it back anymore (I know, gross!).  Having trouble with balance and walking.  The neuropathy makes this even worse to the point I’m using a walker cane thing.  

I don’t really know what I’m even asking here.  I think if really just hit the wall mentally, emotionally, physically.  It’s really tough.  Every time I feel that I take a step forward, I get hit with a freight train.  I just want to feel normal for just one day.  Eat a slice of pizza, go outside and watch my son play.  Hell, I’d go of a walk up the stairs at this point!


I’m sorry about the rant.
