It’s been months now, yet I haven’t seen any spoilers either through posts or YouTube guides.

Everyone has been so careful about allowing natural exploration to occur, and I’m grateful for it.

Haven’t even finished my first playthough, let alone NG+++,  but the fact that I’m *still* in the blind at level 45 is amazing.
