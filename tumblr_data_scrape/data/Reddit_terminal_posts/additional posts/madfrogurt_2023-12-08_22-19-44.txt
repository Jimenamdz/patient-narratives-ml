It's been a while, I know.

I have time now to add some filler and background for this, and I want to complete it. 

Hope everyone reading this is doing well.

>There’s a body count. There’s ribs snapping and metal hooks shoved down mouths to make room for plastic pipes shoved down tracheas. There’s an endless sea of the non-elderly on vents who probably won’t make it. There’s enough moral uncertainty packed into nineteen days that it’s going to feel absolutely *dire* at times.

>The nurses are still as cute in 2020 as they were in 1978 but we now we’re all covered in plastic and paper and a little too terrified to so much as glance at each other. COVID-19 / the Novel Coronavirus / SARS-CoV 2 (if you want to be a dork about it) came along because someone a continent away licked a bat or something and the entire world fell apart. And now if you stood closer than a couple yardsticks away from someone you might die.
