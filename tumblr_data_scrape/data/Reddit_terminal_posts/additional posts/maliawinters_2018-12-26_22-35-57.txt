What does a broken bone feel like? 

Earlier this year my left shoulder/arm broke, and I also broke my right knee around the same time, but I didn’t feel them either very much because I’m constantly on a lot of pain meds. 
But I think my right arm and the same knee are broken again. 

I don’t 100% know if they are and my doctors aren’t coming in until way later today, but I don’t wanna seem like an idiot by saying ‘I think it’s broken’ and really I’m just a wuss or something lmao
