Title: CC Debt: Settlement vs. Payment Plan?

Hey, guys!

I had never carried a balance before, but the pandemic plus a few family crises left me living off my credit cards, and I could no longer pay the minimums on some of them.

The debt on two of them is set to be charged off next month, and I'm not sure what the best course of action is. I don't currently have the money needed to pay settlement offers, but is it better to save up for that or set up a 60-month payment plan?

The payment plan will still report me as being delinquent, right? So, is it better for my future credit to let them get charged off and save up for settlement offers? Or does that look terrible to creditors in the future?

Thank you for any help!
