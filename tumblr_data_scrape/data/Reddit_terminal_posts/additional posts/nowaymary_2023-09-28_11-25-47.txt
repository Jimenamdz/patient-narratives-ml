Title: How do you juggle temporary but recurring space needs

Content:
I live at least 7 hrs by air from most family. I do not send huge parcels but at Xmas I end up with about 8 - 10 parcels for family, friends that have to be organised, packed and sent. 
So at the moment one cupboard has piles of boxes as I begin to get the Xmas stuff organised. It happens every year but because this year I've been doing so much better and my rooms are so much free-r, this year it's annoying me so so so.much. 
I can't cut down much harder than I have. I basically like what I am doing and am comfortable with everything except dealing with the piles. 
So can anyone make any suggestions for allowing space, keeping it open for the two months I need it, or anything else that is useful.
