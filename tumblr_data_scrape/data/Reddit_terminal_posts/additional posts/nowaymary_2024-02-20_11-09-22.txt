Title: Restarted After January Doldrums

Every year January is hard for me. It's the.long school holidays, we run out of patience with each other, run out of money and spend lots on getting ready for the new school year.
I've had a sort of doldrum hangover this month with not getting back into the swing of my decluttering but sort of treading water and things not getting obviously worse
Well today something bit me on the butt (not literally) and I spent three and a bit hours in my office/craft space. I cleared out emails, paid bills, tidied up all the stuff I'd not quite put away, collected a box of donations for a friend who works with youth, a box for the op shop, a box for a craft group that meets in town, and listed some school uniform on the buy and sell page.
I vacuumed, I wiped everything down and I cleared surfaces. 
I have loaded the donations to my car for delivery tomorrow and made a list of tomorrow's work in there.
I even sat in my chair and worked on a craft project!!! First time in weeks!!
Even if you aren't making huge strides forward, as long as you don't sink back to the depths of drowning it's ok. 
I've been beating myself up about a lack of progress but it's pointless to do that. Put the energy into 5 minutes decluttering
