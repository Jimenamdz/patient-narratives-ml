What is the best part of being in a decluttered space for you?
For me it was walking into a room carrying a delivery box and being able to walk without worrying about knocking something over or kicking something. 
Also I have noticed that I sleep better now I have cleared the cr@p from my sightlines in bed.
What is it for you?
Genuinely curious
