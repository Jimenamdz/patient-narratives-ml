Title: This time of year sucks

It's the last dragging bit of cold weather before the nicer weather starts, the nights are warming up but the mornings still hurt. My dr asked if I want to up my pain killers but I'm hoping once the weather improves I will be better. 
My bones hurt. It hurts to walk. It hurts to sit. I am sick of lying in the bath because I need the relief. 
It's just been my Cancer-versary which also stirs up all kinds of stuff. Then today I went to an appt and had to explain it all and I almost cried - not from the situation but from the sheer exhaustion of explaining the same shit all the time. 
Maybe I should make a card with the information on it? 
Can anyone relate? I'm just screaming into the void so my children don't hear me scream
