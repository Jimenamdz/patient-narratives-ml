Content:
I'm in Australia. I'm looking for an 8ply yarn that will knit up to look like a tabby cat colours. I hope that is clear as a description. Where I live there is only Spotlight, and I've looked at three websites where I usually buy and nothing. So I'm hoping someone may have some ideas. 
Thank you
