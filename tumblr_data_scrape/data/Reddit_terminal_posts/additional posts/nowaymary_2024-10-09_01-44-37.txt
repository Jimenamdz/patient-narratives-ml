Title: Legalities of helping a kid?

Content:
My oldest child is 19 and has a friend who lives with their dad. The dad has outbursts where he will yell, throw things etc at their child. A few times they have text my child to come and rescue them (doesn't have a car, lives in an estate that is pretty cut off once the last bus has gone for the day)
Last week was a really bad outburst, my child brought them to our place. I fed them, took photos of their injuries in case it's needed later, gave them a shower and bed for the night, and washed and dried their clothes. 
This morning the father came up to me at the shops and told me if I kidnapped his child again he would press charges. I acted dumb because I was quite intimidated and said you have the wrong person. 
So this kid is 19. Can't afford to move out, but can't tolerate much more. What are the legalities here? How much can my child and me do?
Basically I have said you are welcome here whenever and given my number.
