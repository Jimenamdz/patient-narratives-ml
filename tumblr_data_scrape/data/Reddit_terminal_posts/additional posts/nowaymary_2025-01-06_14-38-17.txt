Title: Really Proud of my Children

Content:
So I have 3 children.  One is super organised,  a natural minimalist. Thinks carefully about what they want,  and how it fits in with what they already have. Their room is always immaculate.  
The other two are messy. One is what I would call a nest builder - pillows, blankets etc in the corners, on the bed etc. The other is a Hansel and Gretel explosion type - follow the trail of stuff to find them. 
All 3 had a post Xmas room clean. 
Wow.
The nest builder has taken out 3 black sacks of rubbish, a car load for donation plus a box of items for other people (they definitely want it and we will deliver this week)
The exploder has donated 2 big boxes of clothes, a box of various ornaments etc, three blankets and a box of art supplies!!
I'm so proud that they decided what was going. The nest builder said well mum I looked in your room and it's so much bigger than mine, then I started thinking maybe my room would be bigger if I just had, like you know, not as much stuff....
I think my example is helping and I'm really relieved because I come from a long line of emotional hoarders.
