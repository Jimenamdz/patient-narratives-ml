I've been catching up on distractible since I've been going through chemo (literally still in like maybe feb of 24 for reference)  and I had to share what just happened. 



 I'm cleaning out the cupboards at my place and I'm talking to my mom telling her I'm listening to a podcast.  IMMEDIATELTY she says, without warning, "Is it the one with that ape guy?"

  
I burst out laughing because I have absolutely NO IDEA what she's talking about.  So I ask her what shes talking about.  She says, "You know, the guy with the long ish hair and a beard."

  
I don't listen/watch any other podcast and I had it on my screen so I show her.

  
Mark, apparently, is the "ape guy."

  
Do with this information what you will.  I don't even know what goes on in her head sometimes lmao.
