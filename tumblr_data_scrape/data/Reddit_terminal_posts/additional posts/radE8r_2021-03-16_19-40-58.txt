Title: Is it valuable to ‘know thyself’?

This is something that occurred to me that I wanted to ask, more for curiosity’s sake than need of guidance. As I continue practicing meditation and studying the dharma, I notice that I’m more aware of what’s happening in my mind and am better able to account for what I’m experiencing. This is the case for small “mundane” things as well as more significant glimpses into things like suffering. For example, simmering latent anger from traffic this morning still making me impatient with the dog; or realizing that more dessert won’t satisfy that subtle, barely-perceptible dissatisfaction in my mind. 

Obviously, with annatta/emptiness, the ‘self’ that is ‘known’ here is false, a fabrication. But that leads me to my question: has your progress on the path enabled you to know or to ignore your ‘self’ more easily? I see basis for both positions in the teachings of the dharma. My impression is that as wisdom and insight increase, one would better understand the processes and functions of mind, which leads to a decrease in suffering (at least in my limited personal experience). My next impression is that the increase in ‘self’-awareness would lead to understanding of non-self as these mental patterns and formations become better understood. 

What do you think? Is knowing yourself of value for practice? Has this been addressed in the texts/scriptures? I’m not asking for guidance so much as just curious what people here think.
