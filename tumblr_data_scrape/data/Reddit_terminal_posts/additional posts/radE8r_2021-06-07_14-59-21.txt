Title: A question for the Vinaya rules lawyers

I’ve taken to sleeping on the ground recently, partially because my bed hurts my back and joints, but also partially because it’s a recommended practice for the Uposatha days. (And hey, can’t forget to sleep on a low bed for the full moon if you sleep on a low bed for *every* stage of the moon!) I’ve found that a memory foam pad underneath my sleeping bag greatly increases how comfortable I am, and improves my sleep somewhat. My question is this: would the foam pad invalidate the idea of sleeping on the floor for the Uposatha? How would something like a foam pad be evaluated in terms of the Vinaya?

I know that I’m not a monk, and therefore, not bound by the Vinaya. But IIRC it provides descriptions of the kinds of beds to be used by renunciates, so I guess it would be a good measuring stick for this particular practice. I believe the rule concerning beds is that it can be no higher than 8 finger-widths off the ground, which I assume is in reference to a woven-style bed on a wooden frame.

I’m not necessarily worried about my bed necessarily breaking Vinaya rules/Uposatha observances, just curious about how the Vinaya would interpret my sleeping situation.
