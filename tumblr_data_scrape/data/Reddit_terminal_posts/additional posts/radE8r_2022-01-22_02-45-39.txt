Kind of a second progress follow-up post, but I just had a really satisfying training session and wanted to share. I love kung fu. Every day I'm stronger and the movements are easier to do well. I'm starting to actually apply the instructions my sifus have talked about -- deeper stances, better balance, more fluid movements. 

In addition to feeling better and being in all-around better shape, I'm starting to understand what the sifus say about learning and forming better qi patterns too. Today, when I was starting on body formations, I stood up correctly kinda by accident and it almost... *crackled*. The balls of my feet connected with the earth and I felt the energy flow, just like they say it does. It was refreshing, and I was able to keep a better balance and flow between the positions.

I hope this doesn't verge on "mall ninja shit", but my practice is starting to pay off, and my enthusiasm seems to double each time I train. I ended my session today with a grin ear to ear. They won't always be euphoric like that, but I'm pumped about the changes learning kung fu has brought to my life and the ways it'll continue to make it better.
