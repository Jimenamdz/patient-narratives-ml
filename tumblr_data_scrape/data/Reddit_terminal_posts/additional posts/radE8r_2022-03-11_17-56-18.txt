Title: Slippery, subtle dualism

I was reading Omori Sogen Roshi's *Introduction to Zen Training* and this passage resonated with something I'm wrestling with in my practice now.

>In his youth, Baso \[Chn. Ma-tsu Tao-i\] did zazen diligently every day. Seeing this, Priest Nangaku Ejo \[Chn. Nan-yueh Huai-jang\] asked Baso, "What do you expect to accomplish by doing zazen?"   
>  
>Baso answered, "I sit because I wish to become a Buddha." He had forgotten that zazen itself is Buddhahood and was probably trying to become a Buddha through zazen. To demonstrate his mistake, the priest began to polish a roof tile vigorously while Baso was doing zazen. Baso became puzzled and asked, "What are you doing?"  
>  
>"I'm thinking of turning this into a mirror," replied Ejo.   
>  
>"Will a roof tile become a mirror if you polish it?" asked Baso. Priest Ejo glared at and answered, "Can you become a Buddha by doing zazen?"  
>  
>\[...\] Ejo continued his admonition:  
>  
>"You students, are you trying to learn zazen or are you trying to learn sitting Buddhahood? If you are learning zazen, Zen is not sitting and lying down. If you are learning sitting Buddhahood, Buddha is not a fixed form. According to the teaching of non-attachment or non-settling down, you should not try to adopt this or reject that. You students, if you try to become a sitting Buddha you kill the Buddha, and if you become attached to sitting you will not reach that principle."   
>  
>\[Omori Roshi continues,\] If we interpret this literally it probably means the following:  
>  
>"You students! Are you trying to learn zazen or are you trying to become a Buddha? If you are trying to learn zazen, you must not be taken up by the form called 'sitting' because Zen is something beyond sitting and lying down. Again, if you say you are trying to become a Buddha, you cannot become a captive to the one set form called 'sitting' because Buddha is something absolute." (Omori 2019: 16-17)

This passage occurs amid Omori Roshi's discussion about correct motivation for Zen practice, but for me it spoke to the subtle ways dualism can sneak into practice, even when we're trying our darndest to step outside the dualistic framework. Something that becomes clearer each time I sit down to practice *susokukan* is the subtle notion of "Oh, here I am, sitting. I am meditating. This is me transcending dualism. Here I go!" Even though these ideas don't necessarily appear in my mind as verbal thoughts, the dualistic idea that an individual self is sitting down to accomplish something is difficult to escape.

What I find particularly difficult is setting aside the tendency to evaluate how the sitting session is going. The irony is that obsessively fixating on the quality of my sit ("oh, this is going well! I'm doing it!" or "bah, you're undisciplined and lazy; why else can't you do this one simple thing?") is absolutely what's distracting from successfully practicing susokukan. Ejo's point seemed poignant, so I thought I would share it here.
