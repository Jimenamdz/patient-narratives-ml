*Bring your most burning questions and ask them to Meido Moore Roshi in this Live Q&A Session. Questions can be about any topic related to practice, Rinzai Zen in general, video course materials, meditation, inner exploration journey, and more. If you don’t have specific questions, we still encourage you to join, as you can learn valuable insights from the teacher’s responses.*
