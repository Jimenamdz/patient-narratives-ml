Title: Making a ritual of reflection/emotional check-ins

Hey friends,

I want to make a daily ritual of journaling and taking stock of my emotions, but I'm not sure when I should fit it into my schedule.

I'm to the point of therapy where your head finally breaks above water and the deep dark of it fades away. Psychology-based self-help literature have been really helpful, as has spending time taking stock of my emotions and journaling. The trouble is, I've been squeezing reflection/journaling time in whenever I can, and I'd like to cement it into my daily schedule a little more.

It's a bit of a strange question, but I'm looking for your experience and suggestions and feedback. If you've got a journaling habit, **when do you work it into your schedule?** Have you found that it works better at certain times of the day? I already meditate in the mornings and afternoons and practice yoga just before supper. (I'm unemployed at the moment because of some long-term health issues, so my schedule is very flexible.)

The idea is to make this part of my day into a habit, so that I can track my emotional health from day to day, and so that I always stay on top of it.
