Title: Vein irritation worsening?

Has anyone else had weird phlebitis that seemed to get worse over time? I got my second round of chemo (cisplatin+etoposide) around 10 days ago, all three infusions in my right forearm. 

Now I have firm, tender bumps in what (I think are) my veins. The GP I saw said phlebitis and told me to treat with baby asprin and warm compresses, but that was a few days ago. Now there are two more bumps in the original vein and one larger one in an adjacent vein. 

Anyone else had this? I'm not terribly concerned, but it's just weird and I don't know what to do.
