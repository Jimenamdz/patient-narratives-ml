Title: Medicine Buddha mantra in Japanese

Calling all shingon practitioners!

I'm looking for videos or recordings of the Yakushi Nyorai mantra so I can chant it easier. My roshi gave me the mantra informally when I asked for something that helps with healing. However, I don't know what melody is used to chant it, or if a melody is used at all. I'm looking specifically for the Japanese form ("on koro koro").

Please drop links to your favorite videos -- if they exist. I haven't found anything on youtube, and believe me, I've tried. I also accept DMs if necessary. 

Thanks!
