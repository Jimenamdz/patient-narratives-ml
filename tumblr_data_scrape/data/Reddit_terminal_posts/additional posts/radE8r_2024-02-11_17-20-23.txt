Title: Wheelchair users: help!

I was paralyzed in early October and I'm just now getting around to feeling like meditating and pursuing spiritual work again. But sitting is forever changed for me because my legs don't work. Getting down and up off the floor isn't really possible anymore. 

What do other wheelchair users do? Should I get a big ottoman? Should I invest in a lift for getting down to the floor? What about just a good, padded bench? I can probably make my wheelchair itself work well enough, but I liked having a designated space.

For that matter, space is another issue. My bedroom is now on the ground floor of the house, and it's partially a shared space (the rest is my dad's office). What are some options to set aside a little space in a room that's already hurting for extra space? How can I transform a multi-use corner of my bedroom into my meditation area? I'm thinking of getting a thangka and hanging that to demarcate that this is a special area, but I need to store other things in that space too. 

Tips and suggestions, especially those from wheelchair users and other disabled folks, are welcome. TIA!
