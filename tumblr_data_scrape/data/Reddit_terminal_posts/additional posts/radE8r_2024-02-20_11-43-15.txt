Title: What does spice do for ‘normal people?

I seem to remember either *Messiah* or *Children* mentioning that for people with some limited prescient abilities, it sort of pushes them over the edge and awakens this, or helps them to see. But since a geriatric isn’t a real class of drug, it got me wondering what melange does for people without any such ability whatsoever? My mind goes to Stilgar, for example. He seems excessively grounded in the present moment of reality, I doubt that he’s got much for prescient ability. So what would melange do for him?

As a sort of related question: why do the ‘classic’ Fremen (that is, of Muad’Dib’s time) put spice in everything? I understand that for Leto II they’re trying to overload him, but what’s the purpose of making coffee with the most valuable substance in the universe, especially since I assume most people are like Stilgar? Is it to keep people slightly entranced all the time?

Perhaps I missed something basic in the first book. I remember struggling so much to get my mind around Herbert’s world that I think I need to give *Dune* a re-read. But maybe y’all can answer this in the meantime. TIA!
