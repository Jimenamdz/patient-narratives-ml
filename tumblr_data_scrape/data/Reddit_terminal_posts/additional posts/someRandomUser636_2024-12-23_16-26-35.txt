I added rails to my already modded ender 3 v2... and while I was doing the ellis speed test at 300mms I notice this weird noise on the Y axis... I check that is alligned and lubricated... any idea what could it be?..

for context I have accel set to 8000 for now.. but even with the noise... the accuracy is good... It can go up to 500 but the noise is teh worst!

UPDATE: I went full steam ahead and added the BIGTREETECH V3 board and set this to 1, now while I get a small BUZZ ... I can go 500mms
