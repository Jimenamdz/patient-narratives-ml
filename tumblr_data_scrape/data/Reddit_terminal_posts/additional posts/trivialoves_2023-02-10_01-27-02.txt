I guess just wondering if I am alone in this. and if I'm not if anyone has had luck with coping

&#x200B;

I'm sitting in the ER and im trying not to cry because i know it will make me feel worse. but my hip replacement hurts, i cant take my oxy because itll be wasted and i need my aspirin twice a day as a blood thinner but i threw it up twice today. migraine wont go away because i cant hold down water or take meds. i feel so short of breath and my heart is racing...

not asking for medical advice like that bc im at the ER already. i couldnt cope. but sometimes it just feels like im such a baby now. i had brain surgery and 4 joints replaced. i should be able to handle vomiting and migraines right? but they all feel like an 8 or 9 to me. idk if i am over sensitive or it just hits me harder but im too weak as a person to deal. its like every surgery recovery i do pretty bad too, idk.

i guess this is mostly a vent too so thanks if you read/say something kind. im just tired. i feel like my brain tumor iss the thing causing the least problems. now its just my body hates me and i cant deal with being sick, my mom offered to take me to the ER because she couldnt see me like this. I was here just earlier this month too. im sure theyll be annoyed but i feel so bad and couldnt try out new meds while waiting to get my bone fixed
