Title: SSI to DAC

Can someone explain to me about switching from SSI to DAC+SSI and backpay/overpayments?

I've been receiving SSI for years bc of my cancer, mom retired & I had to apply for DAC in December. 50% of her payment for me is less than the SSI max so I should end up with $963 across two payments

just confused because my letter/social security site says I will get paid $893 DAC in June for May, but I already got paid SSI for May. It also still says I'm getting max SSI so rn the site says I'm going to get $1836 between payments on the 31st (SSI) and the DAC one (wouldnt that be nice lol). 

I read here about some 2 month thing where you still get max SSI and I don't understand and I'm honestly lost. Idk what I'm missing but I just need to know if I need to prepare to get like way less one month or something bc obviously I have bills and not much $, it seems like I already got overpaid, idk if I'm worrying over nothing but confused about what's going to happen these next few months with my checks.

thanks if u can answer ! sorry this is prob horribly worded idk the letters I got didn't really help explain the switch, just my future DAC payments.
