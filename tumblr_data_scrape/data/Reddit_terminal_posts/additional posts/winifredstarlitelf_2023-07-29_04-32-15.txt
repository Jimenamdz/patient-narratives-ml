Venting here: 

I haven't eaten in a week. My saliva has thickened so much that I have to carry around throw up bags because it triggers my gag reflex and I vomit. I haven't slept a full night since week 2 of radiation (I'm on week 4) and my throat is constantly on fire. I'm so thirsty. I'm not even hungry, I'm just thirsty. I practice my swallow and what little I manage to force down comes right back up. It's gotten to the point that talking will trigger me to throw up. 

I'm getting a G Tube on Tuesday and they told me I'll have magic mouthwash on Monday. I can handle the discomfort and the irritation in my neck and I've finally got the nausea managed from chemo, but the saliva and the sticky viscosity? It's going to kill me. 

I just need some relief. I just need the burning in my throat to stop. At this point it's nothing but bile and acid coming up. I have 2 and a half weeks left of radiation. I can't survive this if I don't stop throwing up.
