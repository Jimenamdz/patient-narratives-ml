Title: Celebrating The Small Stuff

I ate a chicken breast today. A whole chicken breast. It had ranch dressing on it and lettuce and two tomato slices (zaxbys grilled chicken sandwich minus the bread). I haven't been able to finish anything, much less eat anything substantial by mouth because seasonings hurt my tongue, as do must sauces. 

I've been living off keto yogurt with a high protein content, broth, overcooked noodles from Progresso soup, and blended foods. Lately I've been trying more solid foods, trying to get those calories in. 

I hate the G Tube. I want it out and gone. I know how big a help it is, but it feels weird and I hate how it looks under my clothes. And wearing a bra? Fugget about it. It digs into my stoma and hurts. As a woman who is "blessed in the chest" to quote one of my nurses, I kind of need a bra. 

Today's small victory is finishing that chicken breast. And actually being able to taste it! 3 months out of rads and chemo and I'm getting my sense of taste back and able to eat certain solids. I'm still nervous to try more, but eager too. 

Just sharing a little positivity. We all need a dose now and then. And I know you all get it. My friends are very "okay, and" about it. My husband and best friend celebrated it with me. As did my parents. They were pleased for me. They've been there from day one. It's nice to share it with people who will celebrate it with me.
