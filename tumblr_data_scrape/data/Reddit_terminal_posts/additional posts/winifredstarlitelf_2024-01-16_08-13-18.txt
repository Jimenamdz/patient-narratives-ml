Title: HG hospitalization and GD risk

I'm 13w3d today. I was hospitalized two weeks ago for five days with my HG because I couldn't keep anything down, wasn't urinating, and had a severe bladder infection. 

I was diagnosed as a diabetic in May of last year but dropped 100+ lbs and got my A1Cs to 4.9. My doctors said I just needed to keep an eye on my sugars but took me off insulin and meds. Now I'm at high risk for GD, but my blood sugar levels have all stayed well within normal ranges if not lower because I didn't have anything in my system. 

My husband did a bunch of research on HG so he could understand it and is a literal Saint. He has been amazing in helping me with my meds and helping me manage my nausea. My mother, on the other hand, constantly tells me I'm being dramatic and it's not that bad. That all women have some kind of nausea during pregnancy and to stop complaining. Thanks, Mom. 

After being discharged from the hospital all I've been able to eat and keep down is white rice, broth, and ice water. My OB has me logging my blood sugar to keep an eye on it. I've been so nauseous but I haven't had any more vomiting since the hospital. I'm praying that this trend of not vomiting continues because from weeks 4-12 I was bed ridden, vomiting violently, and losing weight rapidly. 

I'm optimistic, hopeful, and yet so scared that missing even a dose of my Reglan will send me backsliding. I'm ready for the anxiety to end. I'm ready to meet my baby and get this pregnancy over with. 

Whoever first said pregnancy is a beautiful experience obviously didn't have HG. Ugh.
