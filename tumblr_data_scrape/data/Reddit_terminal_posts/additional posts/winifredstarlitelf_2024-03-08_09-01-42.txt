My high risk doctor keeps saying how I need to eat x, y, and z because I'm at risk for gestational diabetes. I've been monitoring my blood sugar since before my pregnancy because I have diabetes but was able to completely bring my A1Cs down and was taken off all meds because how well I was doing. My HG has made nutrition so hard and made it impossible to eat anything outside my safe foods. Im finally able to keep certain things down at 20 weeks and drink water exclusively. 

My OB is super proud of what I've been able to accomplish and has said several times that any nutrition is better than no nutrition but my high risk doctor is so dismissive, stating that I'm putting my baby in danger of low birth weight and possible issues post delivery. The OB says baby is strong and healthy, as does the high risk doctor but he keeps adding "for now". 

Dude...shut up. I'm doing the best I can. I'm getting as much in and down as possible and he just keeps harping on how I'm not "trying hard enough". The baby has been called perfect by EVERYONE I've seen medically, including him, but IM not doing good enough. He's the ONLY male on my prenatal health team and the only one putting me down. I want to stop seeing him, but I also know that doing so will cause more stress. 

I'm high risk because I had cancer before I got pregnant and had diabetes. But I was cleared just before we discovered I was pregnant. I'm so over this man's negativity and being told by this guy I'm not doing enough. ðŸ˜’ 

Just needed to vent.
