My water broke at 36w4d. I had wanted a natural labor and delivery, however my baby was having a lot of issues during my labor and after 4 hours of monitoring, they decided a C Section would be the best course of action to keep my baby and myself safe. 

I vomited until I was pulled back into the OR and I was put under general anesthesia. When I woke up I had a beautiful baby boy...and no nausea. I was elated and overjoyed...until it came time to eat something. 

The panic attack snuck up on me. I have spent every day of the last 2 weeks an anxious mess when it comes to eating. I can't eat or drink anything without the fear of being sick again. It takes me hours to finish any type of food and I cry halfway through every time. I also am only eating one meal a day.

I'm on antianxiety meds and anti depressants. I have severe PPD and PPA. My baby is amazing. He doesn't cry much, sleeps well, eats well, he's a superstar. While I haven't thrown up since giving birth, the fear and trauma lingers. My doctors say they're going to work with me on this as well as my other mental health issues, but damn. 

I was so ready to be done with HG. But it still affects me every day. I'm dealing, but not living. This illness is rough. 

You aren't alone. There's nothing "wrong" with you. And it may not go away immediately. It has an affect on us, all of us. Just know you aren't alone.
