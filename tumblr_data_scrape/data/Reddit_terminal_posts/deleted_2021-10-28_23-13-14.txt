I (M/28) was just diagnosed with distant nonpapilliary adenocarcinoma ( which started as a gallbladder cancer) that has spread to my lymph nodes, liver, stomach, and lungs. My doctor just recommended me to not receive  chemotherapy treatment. Basically she said that my cancer was terminal, and that while chemotherapy might extend my life a little, she would recommend me to forgo it because it will destroy whatever quality of life I have left. Is there any other option? She was also not willing to give me a time period for how long I might have left until I get more tests (besides saying it will probably be less than a year) what should I expect?
