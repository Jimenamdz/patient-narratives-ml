I never leave a forum without saying thank you.  I've been extremely lucky in my journey and now the only thing I'm doing by constantly stalking PC forums is wasting more time!  I wish you all nothing but the best from treatment, life, all of it.  I know there's some folks in here that really have it tough and I sure hope you find peace in your lives.  I have heard you.  I have read your struggles.  They have impacted me greatly.  

To the newly diagnosed; these folks in here are great resource!  The help is priceless.  Be your own advocate and remember, any drx promising you something you cannot confirm via other sources are just being cavalier in their message/treatment.  Try other sources and challenge them on their statements.  You just might be amazed how choices become clearer as you get an education in something you never wanted to learn about!!

Kudo's to the supporters!!  Children/spouses/SO's, etc...without you we are nothing!  I can't imagine going through this alone.  I KNOW some of you are.  I don't know how you do it.  No matter how many thanks you get, you can't get enough for being concerned and asking questions to provide help for us.

For me, I'm 5 years total into this and now 18 months post treatment, no issues, back to full power and preparing for retirement.  Sure, I have a good chance of BCR in my future and I've accepted that fact.  What have I learned?  I've got a GREATER chance of living a full life with or without recurrence.  Always thought the saying "you die once but live everyday" was just a pompous saying folks that don't have a terminal disease say.  Unfortunately, they are right!

Good luck all, I wish you nothing but the best.
