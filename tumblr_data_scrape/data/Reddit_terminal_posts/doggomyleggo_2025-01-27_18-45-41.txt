I am 35 and have an incurable cancer - it's recurred a few times (as this one often does). I have a ~30% of long term survival according to the internet, but since it's a rare cancer the data is likely limited. I'm guessing on the lower side given my rate of recurrences. 

I'm not sure whether to save for retirement in my employer-matched 401k. I have no kids of official dependents, though I'm happy to leave some money for my loved ones. 

Just wondering how other folks think about money and saving in this situation.
