I have had melanoma stage 3c for 10 years. Multiple surgeries, immunotherapy chemo etc. During routine scans they noticed lung cancer. (Non smoker) Lobectomy of my my left lung plus 4 months of chemo. Now exactly 2 years later I have lung cancer in my right lung. Just had a very unsuccessful surgery on my right lung. I am now terminal. I also have covid. 
My problem is that my husband refuses to bring me up in conversations. He acts like like my illnesses don't exist. Please don't say it is denial. His is very aware. I don't know ho w much time I have left but I am so weak. Not sure how to bring this up as he gets very verbally and emotionally angry. I need him to drive to doctor appts etc. Not sure what to do.,
