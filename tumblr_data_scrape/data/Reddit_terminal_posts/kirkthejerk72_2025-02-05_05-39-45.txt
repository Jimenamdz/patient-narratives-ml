Recently found out that I'm stage 4 terminal now.  As various people learn this, their reactions have been:

1. Oh so sorry to hear this -- I don't know what to say -- let me know if I can do anything.
2. You should find a different doctor and get another opinion.
3. You should go to this hospital in India that advertises that they can cure stage 4 cancer.
4. You should go to this hospital in Mexico that advertises that they can cure stage 4 cancer.
5. You should stop eating sugar, that will fix it.
6. You should take turmeric, that will heal your immune system and fight the cancer.
7. You should take ivermectin.
8. You should drink colloidal silver.
9. You should take ivermectin \[again\].
10. Here's a little orthodox jesus plaque that will fix you.
11. Here's a crystal medallion that will fix you.

Thank you person #1.  The rest of you a-holes are not invited to my funeral ðŸ˜‚

Edit: a few new ones, plus one that I forgot:

12. Drop traditional medicine and see a naturopath instead.  
13. Just try visualizing the cancer shrinking and that will work \[apparently worked for 'a friend of a friend'\]  
14. Walking barefoot in the desert sand specifically cures stave 4 cancer.  
15. Fenbenzadole (anti-parasite meds for dogs)
