I 20M had recovered from cancer 2 years ago, a few months ago i got to know that it has relapsed.
ive been going through chemotherapy and even underwent bome marrow transplantations to get better.
doctors have told me there's nothing more that they or my body can do and to just pray and do everything i love.
im confused? i feel helpless i dont have much energy to do anything. my parents arent supportive and my girlfriend of 3 years broke up(i dont blame her after everything that im putting her through and i felt i had to let go) 
i feel sorry for myself amd very confused on what to do.
ive given my blood test today and i hope it returns less.
