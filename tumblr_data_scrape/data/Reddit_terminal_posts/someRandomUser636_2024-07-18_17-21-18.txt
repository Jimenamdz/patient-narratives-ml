Content:
A relative of mine has cancer, a small cell one... he has depression and lives isolated... he is already medicated for all that. Now after decades of smoking, he was diagnosed with cancer, and since is pretty advance is pretty much terminal... he was offered chemo with of course no warranties... best case scenario, the tumor is stopped for now but will come back.. the other option is to just care for him until the end.. he is still smoking, eats bad, don't do any exercise..is not that any of that will change... and the chemo for what I saw is rough... he is going to have a very bad time for what?.... can I have some comments from people who had chemo to tell me what is like?.. I think he should choose not to do it... is sad, but he quit 'life' a long time ago ...
