Title: Why does cancer have to be everywhere??

Ever since I got pcR last summer, I've been doing pretty okay mentally. Of course I still get scanxiety and now it's harder to do self exams since my left breast is 80% scar tissue, but I've been doing pretty okay. I still had to do radiation and I'm finally on my last round of Xeloda and it's all precautionary but it's fine, and I've been doing pretty okay. 

But lately I'm starting to struggle because it seems cancer is everywhere. Coworker's friend dying of cancer. A Redditor I once exchanged messages with about our cancers recently passed just the day before her daughter's 1st birthday. Another coworker has terminal cancer. My cat had a malignant tumor we removed 6 months ago and now it's back and bigger than it was when we had it removed. And now I'm slowly sliding back into a dark place. I'm trying really hard to be optimistic, to not think about my cancer coming back, so I can enjoy our new home with my son who will be 1 next week. 

Fuck cancer.
