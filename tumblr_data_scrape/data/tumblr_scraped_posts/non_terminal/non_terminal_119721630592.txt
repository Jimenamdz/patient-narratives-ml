7 YEARS CANCER FREE

<p>7 years ago today I was told I was officially in remission.



</p><p>There have been a few scary false alarms and difficulties along the way but I have made so much progress in 7 years. </p>



I am nicer to myself.<br/>

I have a college degree.<br/>

I have a job I’m great at.<br/>

I’ve got people that care about me.<br/>

I am doing pretty okay. <br/><br/>

&hellip;For a while I didn’t think any of that was possible.<br/>



<p>I was resilient in the face of some terrible stuff.<br/><i>This body beat cancer. </i><br/>

And so much more.<br/>

And I’m proud to say that it’s mine.</p>
