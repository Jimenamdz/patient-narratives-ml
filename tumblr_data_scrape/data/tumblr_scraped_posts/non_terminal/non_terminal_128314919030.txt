<p>I just posted this to facebook but I thought I’d let my Tumblr family know too. I know most of you don’t know me irl (in fact I’d say like 4 of my followers are people I actually know?) But hey it’s a blog and this is my life so I’ll just tell you guys what’s going on.</p><p>This week has been really hard for my entire family (for more than one reason), and I wanted to share some of why that is. On Monday, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Today, I found out I have a rare subset of Hodgkin’s disease called Nodular Lymphocyte Predominate Hodgkin’s. While that sounds even worse, it turns out that it is a non-aggressive, more localized form of cancer that is actually easier to treat. The doctor told me today that there is a fairly good chance I won’t need chemotherapy! Over the past couple of days I have been preparing for the worst, so this visit with the specialist today was a breath of fresh air.</p><p>I should note that while I’ve been given a somewhat optimistic prognosis for the time being, I still have to get more tests done that will paint a clearer picture of the months to come. I’m crossing my fingers but I’m also trying to be realistic. </p><p>(ommitted my schmaltzy paragraph about how thankful I am for my friends and family right now because this is tumblr)</p><p>And hey, it’s the good Hodgkins.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd-AEkvmg54">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd-AEkvmg54</a></p>
