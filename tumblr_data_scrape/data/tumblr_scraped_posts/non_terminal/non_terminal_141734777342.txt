Complete Remission!

<p>I found out 2 weeks ago I’m in complete remission from leukemia! Because of the chemo I had (ATRA and arsenic trioxide) I need to wait at least a few months before trying again to get pregnant. I’m thankful that my fertility wasn’t completely lost due to cancer, but the wait is agonizing. I have my next follow up in June to ensure that the leukemia is still in remission, and I think we’re aiming to try and start ttc after that appointment. There’s always a chance it could come back, but the odds are in my favor that it won’t.</p><p>All my oncologist has really said was that the treatment wouldn’t impair my fertility, but he’s never personally had a patient go on to have children that he knows of. The kind of leukemia I had was so rare, and the treatment I had is so new. There are a few clinical studies I’ve dug up of successful pregnancies over the last few years following the type and cancer and treatment I had, which gives me some hope.</p><p>My fingers are crossed that the reason we couldn’t get pregnant was because I unknowingly had cancer and my body just knew what not to do.</p>
