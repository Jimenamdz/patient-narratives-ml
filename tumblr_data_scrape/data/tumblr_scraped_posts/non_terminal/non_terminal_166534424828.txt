medians for people with my diagnosis:

<p>median time cancer-free after you get rid of it the first time: 6 years</p><p>median life expectancy post diagnosis: 12 years</p><p><br/></p><p>These seem like small, scary numbers, but they’re just averages. I’m above average as a person (YEP) and I’m young and I’m strong and I have a really good attitude (not stopping) - I’m expecting to be cancer free wayyyy longer than 6 years and I’m definitely expecting to live more than 12 years lol. I mean come on. </p><p><br/></p><p>i know this is a little morbid but I know it’s like the first thing people think of when someone is diagnosed w cancer. It was the first thing I thought of, lol! Thank goodness for that IDH1 mutation of mine &lt;3 </p>
