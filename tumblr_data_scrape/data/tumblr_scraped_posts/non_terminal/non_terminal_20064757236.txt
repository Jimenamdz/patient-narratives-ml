Aw, 14 months today since I was diagnosed with cancer.

<p>Met so many inspirational people and friends throughout this journey. These include many motivational speakers at the Find Your Sense of Tumour conference I attended last month - most of them just normal people who had had cancer as a teenager very recently, or a few years ago, and how they overcame various aspects. Sean Swarner, who&rsquo;s often on news channels in America, did an amazing talk. He had the same cancer as me, in the most aggresive form. He beat that then had another, extremely rare cancer; was in a coma; and now has only one working lung, yet he&rsquo;s climbed the highest mountain in every continent. He was the first cancer survivor to climb Mount Everest, and when he reached the summit, buried a flag with the names of 300 cancer survivors who inspire him, there. Sean was amazing. I&rsquo;ve met so many friends and am going to my second Teenage Cancer Trust concert at London&rsquo;s Royal Albert Hall on Sunday, to see Jessie J.</p>

<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t had been diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma on 28th January 2011, I wouldn&rsquo;t have ever been as inspired as I was, by Becky Bishop. If my own cancer - which was the same type as Becky&rsquo;s - had never happened, I&rsquo;d still have seen her Wigless Wednesday gif on my dashboard on here, but it couldn&rsquo;t have meant as much to me as I did due to my situation. RIP Becky. It&rsquo;s her funeral on Saturday and I still can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s gone. It&rsquo;s so unfair. I know she is someone we can all learn from.</p>
