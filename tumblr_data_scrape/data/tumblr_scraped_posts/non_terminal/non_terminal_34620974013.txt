I am full of fear.

<p>Remission has ceased. It turns out that my cancer spread and I went through about a million and on scans and tests and I find out Wednesday if it has reached any lymphnodes. If it has, I start Chemotherapy soon after. This is a nightmare and I have never been this upset with my illness. I&rsquo;ve done everything that I&rsquo;m supposed to do. I try to be a good person day after day. All my efforts are fruitless, though. The past few nights have been a trainwreck. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about the possibility of chemo. It brings tears to my eyes everytime. Work and school will be virtually impossible. And how can I expect my boyfriend to love me if I&rsquo;m bald. I&rsquo;m a mess, and I have no idea what to do.</p>
