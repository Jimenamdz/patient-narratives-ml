Words From A Cancer Survivor

<p>First off, I&rsquo;d like to say that that is such a wonderful fucking phrase to be able to say; <strong>&ldquo;I am a cancer survivor.&rdquo;</strong> I beat cancer, kicked the ever-living shit out of it, and chased it back to the island of misfits toys.</p>

<p>That being said, the whole experience really tore me up. And it&rsquo;s going to be a long time before I feel &ldquo;normal&rdquo; (whatever that means) again. The physical part of it was pretty bad. Not being able to sleep, constantly throwing up, and just lots of overall pain. Staying in hospitals and surgery and MRIs/CTs suck. But what really kills you, is the mental aspect of it all. The constant worrying about, well, everything. School, friends, your family, wanting to eat because you&rsquo;re starving but you physically can&rsquo;t, emotional imbalance, crying your damn guts out. And let me be the first to tell you, people will let you down during this process. They won&rsquo;t be there for you and that sucks.  It really does. But you start to really appreciate the people who are there for you.</p>

<p>But for now, I&rsquo;m okay. There&rsquo;s a chance it could come back in a few years. There&rsquo;s a good chance. And even if it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s possible that my brain was adversely affected by the whole process. But for now, I am okay. There are still sleepless nights and tears and anger and all kinds of emotion that I can&rsquo;t even describe. But for now, I am okay.</p>

<p>So please, if you need someone to talk to, someone to lean on, or just someone to listen to you cry on the phone for hours, tell me and I will not hesitate. I understand. </p>
