Best facebook post ever!!!!

<p>I popped in there, and I am so glad I did. Just look at this post from my ex-next-door-neighbor:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I dare say it out loud? OH YES I DO! Today, I am officially in remission! So long Breast Cancer! You are just some hideous disease that I once had and in the words of the great poet Taylor Swift, we are NEVER, EVER, EVER getting back together!&rdquo;</p>
