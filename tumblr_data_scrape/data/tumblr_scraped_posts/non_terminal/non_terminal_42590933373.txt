<p>ok, just thought I’d share the news with ya’ll considering I’m telling everyone. Today they’ve finally told me that I’m in <em>remission</em>, FINALLY, and I am on the way to becoming healthy again; it looks like the probability of a return is also very slim. No more chemo, no more fucking long stays in the hospital. I’m in tears of joy. They’ve got to finish up my blood work for records then I’m free!</p>
