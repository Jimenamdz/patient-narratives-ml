<p>Its almost like a first nature to me now. I havent been feeling 100% the last few weeks&hellip; And tonight i have two GINORMOUS lymphnodes in my neck. I mean you can pratically wrap your fingers around them. Ive had major headaches the last week. Any sudden fast movements and i get a pulsating headache. I feel like a fucking hypocondriac but i cannot help but to scream CANCER. Im not saying i relapsed but i remember the day i was diagnosed with what they thought was the cyst. And i had went to the dr for a check up because i had swollen lymphnodes and not feeling 100%&hellip; Im fighting so hard not to goto the ER tonight&hellip; 1) my share of cost to be seen is $700 dollars. 2) eric works at 7am and even though he offered tonight i dont want to 3) go in.. Get billed and be nothing. 4) im worried ill get cancer again, be out of my almost 6 year remission and die. </p>

Can you blame me?!? I remember anything a few years ago i thought my cancer relapsed. And a few times it seemed it did. </p>



<p>Funny thing is ive been attending church now because of my new job i go with my residents to church. I believe in God.. I just cant goto church? If that makes sense. I feel an un easiness and that sounds terrible i know so dont judge me. But its late and i feel horrible and i cant help but to feel anxious right now :&rsquo;(</p>
