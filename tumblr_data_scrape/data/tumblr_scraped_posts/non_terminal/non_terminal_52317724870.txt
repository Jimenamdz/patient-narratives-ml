Not a fan of today already..

<p>I’ve been cancer free for almost 8 years now.  Today the doctor calls me and tells me all my results came back pretty much fine. Only thing they noticed is some stuff with my heart. Not a big issue at the moment just something to be looked into.  </p>



<p>I don’t want anything bad happening. I’ve been doing so well. It scares the shit out of me even though its not a big issue.  No cancer still, which is great, but now and until the day I do die, I have to worry about what the chemo has possibly done to the rest of my body.  As if dealing with cancer wasn’t bad enough, there’s always more that can happen.  And that blows.</p>
