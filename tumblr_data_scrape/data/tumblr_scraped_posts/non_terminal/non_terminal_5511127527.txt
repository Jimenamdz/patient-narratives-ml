On one of the reviews someone left on my story, they asked me if I had done my research.

<p>I wanted to punch the computer. (AND they asked me like 29 questions, but they have PM turned off. O.o.)</p>

<p>They have NO idea how much research I have done.</p>

<p>I know more about biopsies then I ever wanted to. I&rsquo;ve seen videos, I know what happens after, I know what not to do before one.</p>

<p>I know a shit ton about MRI machines. Do you know what the difference between an MRI and a CT scan is? No? I do. I know ALL about it. I know how MRIs work, I know what the best brand is, I know what freaken sounds you hear when inside.</p>

<p>I know about wigs. Fake hair vs. real hair. I know the general costs, ways to take care of it and style it, how many times it should be washed a week.</p>

<p>I know about the general path of lung cancer. I know how it starts, I know the procedures to try to get rid of it. I know how it spreads. I know how fast it spreads. I know where it usually spreads.</p>

<p>I know about chemotherapy. The side effects, how long the side effects last, how long the chemo session takes.</p>

<p>I generalized on the amount of time it would take for her to go into remission (I read four articles about remission yesterday), because it&rsquo;s different for everybody. I have it at 6 rounds of chemo, which is 12 weeks so about 4 months. I know it&rsquo;s short, but that&rsquo;s what I wanted and I found it fairly reasonable&ndash;plus (for my readers that I know followed me on here) it&rsquo;s not gone forever, soooo :)</p>

<p>So, tumblrers, do you think I&rsquo;ve done my research?</p>
