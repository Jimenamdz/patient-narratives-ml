It's been a while... (UPDATES)

<p>Well my doctor put me on lock down once again. I guess I was getting ahead of myself. When you hear that your immune system is good you want to explore a little but my white blood cells played me. So I&rsquo;m back to my house. I have been exercising a little to bring my weight down. (But the steroids keep me hungry, grrrr!) The good thing about this is I have only TWO more chemo sessions left!!!!! September 4th is my last session!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   If you only knew what I&rsquo;ve been through these past six months. I am just so ready to be able to enjoy something simple as a salad. I know I won&rsquo;t be back to my 100% but I am ready to start my NEW NORMAL. <br/>

I ready to spread awareness about this blood disease, lymphoma. Many young people do not know about it but I will keep them aware. It&rsquo;s funny people think cancer holds people back but in reality cancer is a jump start for people to be active and start something positive. I am so close to being in remission I can feel it!</p>
