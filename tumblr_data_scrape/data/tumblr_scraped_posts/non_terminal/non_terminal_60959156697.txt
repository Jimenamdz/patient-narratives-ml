Cancer-versary

<h5 class="uiStreamMessage userContentWrapper" data-ft='{"type":1,"tn":"K"}'><span class="userContent">A year ago today I was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkins lymphoma cancer. I will never forget how scared I was hearing that word, knowing that my life was over at 26. Fortunately God is the great physician, and He healed me. Now I am in complete remission and am so thankful for every day on this Earth. I am making big changes, because I don&rsquo;t want to look back at my life and remember that I was too lazy, stubborn, or comfortable to do better. We are not promised tomorrow, so I am going to make good choices today.</span></h5>
