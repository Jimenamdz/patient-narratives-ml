Blessed boredom

<h2>Blessed boredom</h2><p>Look. I have <i>ideas</i> about how my life could be exciting! Get on stage! Travel the world! (Get vaccinated against Corona, but, you know!) Be an independent writer/sleuth/free spirit!</p><p>But what I am actually <i>motivated</i> to do is decidedly boring, predictable, safe, like &ldquo;Yes. Or you could get a part time office job let&rsquo;s go for that.&rdquo; </p><p>And I am screaming yolo!! Yolo!!! Earth to the person in cancer remission?! When else are you going to live dangerously?!! You could do <i>so</i> <i>many awesome things </i>before they send you back to hell - </p><p>And my motivation is like. &ldquo;You. Are going to do the most. <b>Boring. Low stakes. Mundane </b><b>shit</b>. You can think of. Seriously. You are going to bore Bert from Sesame Street to tears. Or I block every single initiative in your brain. Do you hear me. I aint playing. Boring and safe or I&rsquo;m shutting you down.&rdquo; </p><p>And then my heart is sobbing like. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s bad, if&hellip; You know, I didn&rsquo;t dream so big. Did I face dose dense chemo for this? What is wrong with me?&rdquo; </p><p>And then my motivation is like: &ldquo;If I never feel another drop of adrenaline again it&rsquo;ll be too soon. Shut up and apply to be a part time clerk in some boring ass office.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; I wanna have some fun&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You be good and I&rsquo;ll let you go see a band once every six months. Maybe you can go on a weekend trip to Denmark.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But Denmark is - &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boring. So blissfully boring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I hate you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m boss.&rdquo;</p><p>(No offence meant to Denmark, btw. It is very similar to Holland and northern Germany - sadly I want to go riding in Argentina but I am afraid to get back on a horse.) </p>
