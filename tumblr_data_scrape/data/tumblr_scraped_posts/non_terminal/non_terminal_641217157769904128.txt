This blog was always a safe haven for me, it was the only place one of my ex boyfriends didn&rsquo;t know to track me.  It was the place I could go to laugh when I had done nothing but cry for days. It made me forget about the bones he fractured,  how I couldn&rsquo;t go home, how truly and desperately I wanted to die. I never had to put too much emotion into it, reblogging pictures that made me smile was therapeutic in a completely irreplaceable way.  At the time time I had another ex sending me hateful anonymous messages. They started mildly enough, eventually growing to &ldquo;kill yourself&rdquo;, &ldquo;you are nothing&rdquo;, even asking me if I had finally committed suicide.  I had to distance myself from this blog. And I lost my sanctuary.  I suffered many more nights until I broke away. </p><p><br/></p><p>In 2020 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I fought. I fought hard. My body brought forward a strength I had no idea was within me, and even now I think back to all I went through having no explanation. In December of 2020, after 16 weeks of chemo therapy, losing my hair and my breast, I was officially cancer free.  There&rsquo;s still radiation, and another surgery&hellip;but I made it a long way. I reclaimed the body that was mine, that had always been mind despite little darknesses trying to silence me. So I&rsquo;m going to reclaim this place too, I worked too hard not to. </p>
