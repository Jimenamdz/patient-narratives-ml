<h2>heyy its World Cancer Day and I thought this is the perfect time to share my experience and open the floor to questions</h2><p>very briefly, I was diagnosed with Hodgkinâ€™s Lymphoma at 15 and after rigorous treatment, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, I am 30 months in remission.</p><p>people are often not sure what it is like to be a young person with cancer and are too afraid to ask, but I am totally fine with answering any questions you may have. in fact i really want to share so ask away.</p>
