Went back and read through my 2020 diary posts about cancer. What a read. It was a scary time... I am very glad that's all over....

<p>Went back and read through my 2020 diary posts about cancer. What a read. It was a scary time&hellip; I am very glad that&rsquo;s all over. My doctors take great care of me, and I&rsquo;m relearning how to take care of myself. A little exercise every day. Eating right. Taking my meds right. Being on top of insurance. </p><p>Looks like I&rsquo;m one of the happy ending cases of cancer. I&rsquo;m lucky, in a way. I live in a time when my cancer is very treatable. </p><p>I read through the comments too. Thank you to everyone for all the hugs, kind wishes and words of strength and encouragement over the years. I was sinking in quicksand and you were my rope. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s just hope the third time is the charm, and that my cancer is forever gone! Even if I&rsquo;m on chemo for the rest of my life! (Enhertu this time.)</p>
