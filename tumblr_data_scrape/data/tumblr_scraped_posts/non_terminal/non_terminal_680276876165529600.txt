Last Year I thought I was Going to Die.

<p>Before the age of 21, I can say I never really thought about death. If I did, it was in an almost hypothetical manner. As if the odds of myself or my friends dying anytime soon was about as likely as a global pandemic overcoming our planet and closing our nightclubs for two years..(har har).</p><p>I never really thought about death until it decided to wake me up one morning and stare straight into my face with its huge, overcoming darkness. Since its first appearance 14 months ago, it has taken on various shades of black: There have been days where it’s been so dark I could not see my hands in front of me. There have also been days where the sun miraculously appeared and my life stretched out as infinitely as I had once believed it was. Now, I realise, this is what life has always been. </p><p>Life pre-cancer had always been an anxiety ridden race to some unknown finish line. I always thought ‘<i>if I graduate from university I will be happy’ </i>or<i> ‘if I lose a little bit of weight I will be happy</i>’ or ‘i<i>f I find a boyfriend who doesn’t treat me the way his resentful father treats him I will be happy</i>’ &hellip; but I’ve learned it simply does not work like that. I know it does not because I have attained the golden ticket that one is only blessed with when their life flashes in front of their eyes; the realisation that life will never be the perfect dream we’ve dreamt, nor will it be a freakish nightmare. Life to me is an accumulation of struggles and the make or break of the overall verdict in your experience resides in exactly what you want to focus on. </p><p>A cancer diagnosis <i>will</i> change your life, no matter what way you look at it. If you are lucky enough to be considered ‘curable,’ you realise that there must be a life after all this suffering. After the chemotherapy and the scans and the pain and the worry, you must pick up your life where you left off. You must move on. You cannot become a professional patient. </p><p>But how can you do that when all your world has become is thoughts of the after world? How can you do that when you wrote letters to your friends in case of your death, to tell them just how much you loved them? When you lay all alone in a hospital bed, thinking you were about to die and all you could feel was a delicious relief? <br/></p><p>The truth is I don’t know yet. I know I have experienced hurt but I have also gained this divine euphoria that I had never felt in life before. Life has become totally and utterly intoxicating. Even as I sit typing this I’ve been stopping to look up from my laptop to just breathe. Very cliche, I know. This kind of euphoria can’t be passed on or traded. I’m not even sure if people who haven’t felt the dark can know truly what this feeling is. I hope maybe this is something my fellow cancer patients can relate to. </p><p>I hadn’t thought of death until I had to. I hadn’t contemplated death until it stood in front of me and asked me to describe it. I hadn’t smelled death until it wafted through my pores, my body pumping out toxins as it tried to sweat out my cancer. I hadn’t thought about death, but I also hadn’t thought about just how fucking beautiful life was.</p><p>As Eckhart Tolle has put it: </p><p><i>The secret of life is to “die before you die” — and find that there is no death.</i><br/></p>
