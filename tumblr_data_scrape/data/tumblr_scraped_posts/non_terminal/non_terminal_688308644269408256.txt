good morning, coffee talk...

<p>good morning, coffee talk&hellip;</p><p>I tire greatly of updating when I feel terrible and don&rsquo;t rise from my bed all day or like this time haven&rsquo;t eaten in 3 days. its cancer, i got it and i live and fight it daily. so if i am gone for a while you will know what it is. trust me if im hospitalized again I will post, its in my nature and some kind of coping mechanism for me. as if in a dungeon i would post every day a mark on the wall to count the days before release or death. im determined to survive this but in all reality one must make the plans and tidy ones life. those two can exist at the same time. I just don&rsquo;t want to announce them. it makes the people around me nervous and it makes my page morose, which is the opposite of what I want. on that note if you want advice or someone to talk to im right here. how to deal with diagnosis or port installation or navigating the medical industry? I can&rsquo;t promise I have the best answers but I will say that right from the diagnosis you are a cancer survivor. that&rsquo;s where your battle starts and that&rsquo;s the best thing to realize when it starts. don&rsquo;t lie down and resign yourself to instant defeat. I saw some of those in the hospital when I lost my stomach. get up. life is there and your first step is choosing it. I like to draw so I draw. I like to garden so I garden. I like to read so I read. I like many things, and I get up to do them even if I am pulling myself out of a pit of despair. I&rsquo;ve said before, I would like it said, I was courageous and optimistic to the bitter end. the less I dwell on death at the door the less chance it has to put its misery spell on me. Im going to live until it is wrestled from my hands, and that&rsquo;s not today and its not tomorrow and its a long way off. the pain and suffering is very real but that&rsquo;s life hurting, not death. resolve to overcome it. mindset is everything. it makes more difference than the overall medical consensus will admit, but every oncologist I have spoken to agrees. even the guy who cut my stomach out. so my biggest advice? get up. decide to live. so happy tuesday. onward we go. take your meds. eat something. drink the coffee. do the things. </p>
