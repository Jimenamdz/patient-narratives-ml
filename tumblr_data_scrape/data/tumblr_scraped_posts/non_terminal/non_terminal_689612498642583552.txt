Just an update...

<h1>Just an update&hellip;</h1><p>Sorry I haven&rsquo;t been around to share my thoughts on Baldur&rsquo;s Gate Commander or Double Masters.  I&rsquo;m just not interested in a format I don&rsquo;t play much or reprints that aren&rsquo;t important to the format(s) I do play.  So, I&rsquo;ve just been playing Explorer over on Arena since New Capenna came out.  </p><p>However, other things have also been interrupting online life.  My best friend just this week has learned he has Stage 3 esophageal cancer and I have been his driver to his appointments since the discovery.  He&rsquo;s been showing signs of this form of cancer for awhile, at times, early satiety when eating, at other times, loss of appetite.</p><p>He&rsquo;s 67 and has other health problems. Either I or one of his kids will be with him at each appointment. There&rsquo;s no treatment plan yet as they&rsquo;re still working on a full diagnosis and whether or not the cancer will spread. He has more lab tests and appointments in the coming weeks.</p><p>Anyway, I hope to fully engage with everyone here in September when Dominaria United comes around, but if I&rsquo;m unable to, I&rsquo;ll be celebrating in spirit.  Hope you all are doing well in your own lives!</p><p>Ciao for now!</p>
