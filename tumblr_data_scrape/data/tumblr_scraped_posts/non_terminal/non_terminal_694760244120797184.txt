update!

<p>cw: cancer (but it’s good news)</p><p>So the last couple of months have been pretty hectic for me, health-wise. As you may know, I had a hysterectomy in July and the surgeon noticed a strange growth in my bladder. I had surgery again in early August to remove it and the pathology came back to confirm that it was cancerous.</p><p>Here’s the good news: I just underwent my final round of testing and as of right now, I am cancer free! We caught it extremely early (stage 0), which means I won’t even need chemotherapy unless it comes back. I’ll get tested again in November and then probably yearly for the rest of my life, but I can live with that!</p><p>My head is still spinning from getting the <i>worst</i> news of my life followed so quickly by the <i>best</i> news of my life, but mostly I’m just feeling very lucky. </p><p>Now that the stress is off, I hope to be more active on the blog. See you folks in the notes! &lt;3</p>
