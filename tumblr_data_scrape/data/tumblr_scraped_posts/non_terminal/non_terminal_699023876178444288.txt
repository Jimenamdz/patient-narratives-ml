My results are on the my chart.

<p>My results are on the my chart. </p><p>&hellip;and I have a host of things going on as usual. the beginning of emphysema, well yeah I smoked 40 years. Nicotine and me are old lovers, on again off again. other than that my lungs are clear.(surprisingly)</p><p>my liver is normal (how can that be!?)</p><p>I have a thickening of the jejunum(gotta look that up), I do understand it to be part of the stomach, I think lol. a small benign cyst on my kidney which they call unremarkable. my bypass and dissection are stable (big yay) the dissection itself is still present, of course,  from the heart to the abdomen. the stent is still slightly leaking on the one end, but other than that the great work of Dr Lum weathered the storm and my vascular system held together. oh yes, then there is this.</p><p> NO DISCREET MASS TO INDICATE RECURRENT DISEASE. follow up cts and endoscopies of course to  monitor that. I also have to look up colonic diverticulosis because I evidently have this too but I think today&rsquo;s news is quite a good thing. Im sure Dr bever and or Dr myer will call me soon, but I feel comfortable in saying I am &ldquo;cancer free&rdquo; as they call it. </p><p>remember, dearest readers, death&rsquo;s hardest contract to collect. I still have mountains to move and work to do. I am so happy to have the gift of more time with my grandchildren. </p><p>Thank you to every one of you for enduring me. I love you guys. </p><p>group hug </p>
