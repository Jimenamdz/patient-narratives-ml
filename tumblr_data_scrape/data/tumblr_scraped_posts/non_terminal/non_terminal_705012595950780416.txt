<p>maybe its just bc i have this older neighbor im acquainted with who told me about her bout of skin cancer on her face no less bc she was in a trade &amp; didnt use sunscreen back then (keep in mind this was like 60s-90s era, she tans and doesnt burn as a white lady &amp; climate change has intensified uv ray absorption since the ozone layer is still getting fucked over) &amp; how she had to get it removed from a spot well embedded in her cheek over a big area </p><p>shes been entirely healthy since in total remission (facial scars dont appear as strongly as they do in fiction, its hardly even there) &amp; she stays out of the sun with clothes &amp; hats along with using spf to reduce the chance of it returning so shes doing fine but humans vs the sun is a battle we only have a goopy protective armor for &amp; an ozone layer &amp; guess which one is bein shredded like a piece of beef rn</p>
