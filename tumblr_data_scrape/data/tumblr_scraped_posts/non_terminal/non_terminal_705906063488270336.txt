The hard part of recovery

<p>Is not just recovery, but how other people perceive recovery and remission. </p><p>When I say, “I am in remission.” I do not mean that I am cured. You are not considered cured until there has been no recurrence of ANY cancer ANYWHERE in your body for at least five years. Even then, seven, ten, even twenty years down the road cancer can still occur. Even the drugs and radiation I was given to treat my cancer can cause leukemia or lymphoma, or other cancers. I have to live with that fear, see doctors and have imaging done for the rest of my life. I am in remission, not cured, not even considered to be cancer-free yet - if ever.</p><p>Recovery is another misconception. Recovery is not a straight line. I was in <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/chemoradiation" target="_blank">chemoradiation</a> - constantly and without a break for five weeks. I was allowed time to recover before starting eight treatments of harsher <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/folfox" target="_blank">chemo cocktails called FOLFOX.</a> Some <a href="https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/chemotherapy/side-effects-chemotherapy" target="_blank">side effects of chemo hang on for a year or mor</a>e. With me that includes neuropathy, chemo brain, vision issues, joint/muscle/nerve pain, balance and mobility issues - some are getting better and some are not. Recovery does not mean that I am well, it means that I am recovering from treatment and trauma (believe me, there is a lot of that). I’m in therapy for that trauma and for survivorship. I’m recovering, that’s all.</p><!-- more --><p>Surgery, imaging, and other procedures are a part of treatment, and I have had in the past year,</p><ul><li>Colonoscopy 2x</li><li>MRI 2x</li><li>CT scan 4x</li><li>Cystoscopy 4x</li><li>Nephrostomy 1x</li><li>Foley catheter 1x</li><li>Uretal stent placement and removal 3x</li><li>Shoulder pin, plate and screws 1x</li><li>X-rays (lost count)</li><li>Full hysterectomy - ovaries, tubes, uterus, cervix</li><li>Bladder and uretal resection</li><li>Colon resection</li><li>Temporary ileostomy, with upcoming reversal and recovery</li><li>Labs - lost count</li><li>Adverse events - reaction to CT scan contrast, reaction to cyclosporin</li></ul><p>Further, recovering from surgery is like recovering from being hit by a bus. It doesn’t take weeks, it takes months, it takes pain control, it takes an understanding of what I can and can’t do afterward. Hell, it took me six weeks to take a shower standing up and that long to be able to put on socks and shoes. Little victories include going up a ladder and changing a lightbulb, or vacuuming, or learning to do squats again. </p><p>Further, having an ileostomy is very isolating. You have a bag attached to your body to catch your shit. Why? Because that resection needs to heal. Your diet is restricted, and lots of things can and do go sideways. If you sweat, the adhesive seal will dissolve. It’s hard to stay hydrated. It can get blocked - painful and potentially dangerous. Your skin gets irritated to the point of bleeding and blistering from repeated applications and removal of adhesive. You have to buy ostomy bags, ostomy rings to make sure the bag sticks, periostomy wipes, skin prep wipes, adhesive remover wipes, a special powder for hurting skin, and because you feel less like shit some cute ostomy bag covers. My ostomy bag shorties are pretty cute, too. Honestly, the first time I looked at my stoma I almost threw up and did cry. </p><p>You can’t just pick up the supplies you need at the local CVS, and ostomy supply companies want a prescription from your doc for each and every little thing. Your insurance may or may not cover the supplies or have a copay. I ended up getting mine from Amazon as it’s cheaper and faster. Anyone who tells you that you should only need to change the ostomy bag every three to five days is a liar. I move, I exercise, I sweat, and that bag does not stay stuck for more than 36 hours. </p><p>Yes, I had someone chirp at me, “But aren’t you better now?” </p><p>I replied, “The simple answer is yes, in some areas I am. The truthful answer would take a lot longer.”</p><p>“Oh.”<br/></p><p>How tired I am of ‘oh.’</p><p>So tired I need a nap. Going to take one now.</p><p>And -</p><p>Fuck cancer.</p>
