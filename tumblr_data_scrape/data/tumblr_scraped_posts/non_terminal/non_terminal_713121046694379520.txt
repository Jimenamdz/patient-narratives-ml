<p>I have to say as a cancer survivor myself, Superman and Lois is doing an admirable job so far depicting Lois&rsquo;s cancer experience. </p><p>1. The shitty parade of &ldquo;hey guys so I have cancer and here&rsquo;s what it means&rdquo; conversations. </p><p>2. The way it impacts the life of everyone around you and how they see you, to the point that &ldquo;person with cancer&rdquo; immediately becomes your primary identity trait.</p><p>3. The amount of time you spend trying to reassure others that you&rsquo;re going to be okay so THEY feel better even though you have no idea if that&rsquo;s true and it&rsquo;s not up to any of you.</p><p>4. The way people describe you as &ldquo;strong&rdquo; or &ldquo;a fighter&rdquo; or whatever to obfuscate the idea that anyone including you has the slightest control over what&rsquo;s going to happen, not thinking about what that implies about those who end up not making it. </p><p>5. The desperation to cling to whatever shreds of normalcy you still have in your life not just because the denial is so alluring but because it&rsquo;s so emotionally exhausting to be &ldquo;cancer girl&rdquo; 24/7. </p><p>6. The terror of anticipating the physical ordeal your body is about to go through because we haven&rsquo;t yet figured out any way to treat cancer that doesn&rsquo;t involve massive cellular damage. </p><p>Anyway a lot of care has clearly gone into this and I hope they&rsquo;ll follow through instead of upending it in like 3 eps by giving Lois miracle Superman blood healing powers with a side of her getting to fly and punch and shoot cool eye lasers. Though I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s exactly what will happen. </p>
