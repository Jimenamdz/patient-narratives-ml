Remission and recovery

<h1>Remission and recovery</h1><p>PT fucking hurts. Between October and March, over the course of three surgeries - not to mention the two rounds of chemo and one of radiation - I lost so much muscle. Honestly, I want a physical therapist who&rsquo;s been where I went. I had titanium put into my right shoulder in October. Then in November, a massive operation with a colon resection (literally a new asshole), ileostomy (so as not to tear my new asshole a new asshole), radical hysterectomy (four inch incision over my pubic bone), bladder and left ureter resection (now pee sideways), and 22 lymph nodes are no longer in me (hello, lymphedema). February was the ileostomy closure and the removal of the surgical staples that let my new asshole heal. </p><p>I write it all down to remind myself it happened to me. I need to remind myself in the face of people expecting my 56 year old self to bounce back like someone half my age. Hell, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect someone half my age to bounce back from this any faster.</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re in remission - you beat the cancer!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remission does not mean cured. It means that for the next five years, I will be dealing with Schrodinger&rsquo;s cancer. I won&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s there or not until my tests and imaging come back clear.&rdquo;</p><p>Anyway, rebuilding muscle hurts. I&rsquo;m working mostly with resistance bands, walking, and balancing exercises that I can do in my living room. Outpatient starts in May. I am&hellip; unenthused. I&rsquo;ll do it, though. At least it&rsquo;s a clinic that specializes in PT for cancer patients.</p>
