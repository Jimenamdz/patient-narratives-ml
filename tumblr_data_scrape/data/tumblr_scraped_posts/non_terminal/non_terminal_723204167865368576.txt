Medical reality check

<h1>Medical reality check</h1><p>Sometimes I feel as if the time since February 2022 has been a long, strange bad dream. Mom&rsquo;s decline into severe dementia came at the same time I was diagnosed with cancer, with her coming off the rails at the same time I was hospitalized and given the nephrostomy. I met with my oncologist yesterday, and I got a big check.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that she&rsquo;s gone, but maybe now you can fully focus on your own health.&rdquo;</p><p>Having my focus all for myself. There&rsquo;s a concept. </p><!-- more --><p>85 percent of the people diagnosed with my type of CRC at stage T4a die. I am one of fifteen percent who survived treatment and surgery and achieved remission. Roughly half of those who start treatment at that stage do not make it to surgery, the stats are worse for those who have to have the resection before chemo and radiation. It is also very likely that this cancer will recur and/or metastasize. As a friend said, I am on the measured mile. It&rsquo;s terrifying, but also freeing.</p><p>Doc also said that when I talk about not bouncing back, not getting better as fast as I want, that they treated me with the most aggressive radiochemotherapy and a second round of 5-FU or FOLFOX-5 (called by chemo buddies &lsquo;the five fuck yous&rsquo;). He reminded me that most people could not survive the treatment. He reminded me that I have time and to cherish it. To think about whether I am trying to heal for myself, or to please others. To internalize that I am on pain meds to ease the pain from damage left by my treatment, and that the pressure to get off them and 'be better&rsquo; is a medical decision - not one that needs to be decided by people who think I shouldn&rsquo;t take oxycodone for pain that can hit a seven or eight on a bad day. </p><p>10 is the pain I woke up with after the big surgery in November 22. I woke up screaming. I was on 10mg of oxycodone every four hours for six weeks.I am now on 5mg every eight-twelve hours. I may be taking these along with robaxin and gabapentin for the rest of my life. </p><p>For my test results, my white cells are all normal or low normals. I may not rebound since these levels have been steady since the end of December, and will have to take greater care to avoid getting sick. I will get sicker, and stay sick longer. My Carcinoembryonic Antigen test shows me to be under the value that would indicate something starting up. My Natera test ought to be back by mid-next week. </p><p>Focusing on my health for the measured mile.</p>
