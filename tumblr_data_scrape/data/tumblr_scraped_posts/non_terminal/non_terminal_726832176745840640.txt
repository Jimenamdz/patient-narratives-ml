House stuff.

<h1>House stuff.</h1><p>When I was doing my chemo, radiation, and surgery the housework really suffered. I didn&rsquo;t have the energy, and at several points it would have been dangerous to have someone to come in and do it. When your treatment is whacking your immune system, and you get sick, it&rsquo;s always more serious. I&rsquo;m doing a lot better, but it has its ups and downs. My kitchen and bathroom are finally cleaned to my satisfaction, and I am going to take a crack at cleaning the rugs today.</p><p><br/></p><p>I&rsquo;ve been concentrating on the big Out - getting rid of stuff that I don&rsquo;t want to die with in my house. Yes, I am still in remission, but remission is fragile. I want to have things neat and tidy, and good to go in case I need to go back into treatment. I&rsquo;m not being a pessimist, I&rsquo;m being a realist. I understand the power of positive thinking, but I also understand that if 20 people were in a room together, and had the type and stage of cancer that I was diagnosed with, only three of us would survive. It&rsquo;s a point I have to make over and over to some people, and I can&rsquo;t even tell you how tired I am of making it.</p><p>Sorry, I needed a little rant.</p><p>Yesterday was a lot of errands. I had to go pick up my meds for the month, go to the bank, stop at FedEx Office, and then run at Ace Hardware. It was a very long and tiring run, but my Uber driver was super cool. He even went into the hardware store with me.</p><p>My building is going back to covid protocols, we have had a lot of sickness in the complex. And I had covid back at the beginning of July. Apparently, there is a new strain to be concerned about. It was the same at the hospital with people being met at the elevators with masks and hand sanitizer. I did find the wrench that I needed, and the part to fix my sink. Our building super is currently hospitalized, and they are trying as much as possible to avoid spreading anything further through the tenants.</p><p>Even though my white count is better, it is still in the lowest range of normal. I&rsquo;m really not up for the risk.</p><p>Otherwise, I did order a new steam mop after my old one died, and I really have to say that Bissell makes one hell of a product. Most cleaners just put layer after layer of crap on your floor. That&rsquo;s why when you&rsquo;ve been in a place for a while your floors are sticky. I have always used a steam mop ever since they came out. I think this is the best one I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p><p>I am strong enough now to lift a 4 gallon stock pot, and can easily empty the dehumidifiers. I can do the stairs three times per day, but it&rsquo;s very tiring. Tai chi and resistance bands do help. The lymphedema in my right leg comes and goes, and seems to respond to some kind of inflammation going on. Friday and Saturday were very painful for me, and I had two huge patches of psoriasis. üêùüêù Turned me on to using zinc oxide powder, and it makes one hell of a difference in a very short time. I applied it to my hands and the swelling is down a lot today. I think I will mix it into a scalp mask and let it sit while I have my Sunday bubble bath.</p>
