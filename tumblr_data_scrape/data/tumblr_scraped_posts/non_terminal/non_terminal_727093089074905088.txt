Pretty pictures vs. reality

<h1>Pretty pictures vs. reality</h1><p>I am in remission. </p><p>I did not &lsquo;beat&rsquo; cancer and I am not 'cured.&rsquo;</p><p>Remission means that they can&rsquo;t find cancer right now.</p><p>Being in remission doesn&rsquo;t mean I feel anything near 'normal.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s still neuropathic pain, somatic pain, fatigue. The pretty pictures on the clinical brochures don&rsquo;t cover that, or the sometimes permanent effects of nerve damage and radiation fibrosis, or that having lymph nodes removed causes other problems. Pain management is going to be with me for the rest of my life.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to get grouchy.</p>
