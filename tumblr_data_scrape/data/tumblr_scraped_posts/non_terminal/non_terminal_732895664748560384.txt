Patience, Universe, give me patience.

<h1>Patience, Universe, give me patience.</h1><p>How invested are people in getting others to be unhappy? These folks, I don&rsquo;t even know what to call them, but they are invested in trauma like it&rsquo;s a new c-drama. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s some news.</p><p>Yes, I am traumatized. Yes, I talk about it. Cancer is an enormous change in your state of being and your understanding of yourself. Would anyone believe that it&rsquo;s possible to deal with that trauma and be content, even happy? </p><p>I am alive and happy about it. </p><p>Yes, I have problems - medical and mental - but how could I not be happy? I didn&rsquo;t have good odds going in, the cancer might return, but for now I am in remission and alive. I can write. I can eat. I can lie in bed and cuddle my cats. I can exercise. I can work from home and earn my money. I can stand at the stove and cook again. A small circle of people understand this and celebrate with me, but some people I thought I knew well almost want me to be miserable.</p><p>I&rsquo;m alive, motherfuckers, and I&rsquo;m not going to waste that time.</p>
