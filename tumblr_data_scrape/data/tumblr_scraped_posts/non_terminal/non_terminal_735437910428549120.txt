Celebrity, Cancer, and the Sword of Damocles

<h1>Celebrity, Cancer, and the Sword of Damocles</h1><p>Shannen Doherty is a little younger than I am and is a Woman In Public with cancer. </p><p>Good God, that is one tough bitch. </p><p>Cancer strips away so many things we take for granted, puts us through so much. When she was first diagnosed eight years ago, I had sympathy for her. I knew treatment had changed a lot, and I was hopeful that she&rsquo;d &lsquo;beat cancer.&rsquo;</p><p>Now I&rsquo;m looking at it from the inside, knowing that remission is not beating cancer. I love her for spreading that out there and having the courage to say it.  We love pretty pictures, happy endings, inspirational stories. It&rsquo;s okay, but they ring hollow from the inside. People mean well, but there&rsquo;s almost a guilt when you have to disappoint them. Remission means they can&rsquo;t find cancer right now. If you make it past five years in remission, you&rsquo;re considered cured, but if the cancer comes back-</p><p>I got my blood test kit yesterday and will gave my draws done in the middle of next week. I&rsquo;ll find out if I am still in remission just before Christmas - it will be my year if I am still 'cancer free.&rsquo;</p><p>Shannen said what&rsquo;s in the mind of so many cancer patients: </p><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>“I’m not done with living. I’m not done with loving. I’m not done with creating. I’m not done with hopefully changing things for the better,” she says, cracking a smile. &ldquo;I’m just not — I’m not done.”</p></blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>“I know it sounds cheesy and crazy, but you’re just more aware of everything, and you feel so blessed. We’re the people who want to work the most, because we’re just so grateful for every second, every hour, every day we get to be here.”</p></blockquote><p>She&rsquo;s fallen out of remission multiple times and the cancer previously metastasized to her brain, for which she had surgery. Now it&rsquo;s metastasized into her bones - the five year survival rate is 29 percent - and she&rsquo;s looking for clinical trials or experimental treatments. I hope I can be as brave since my chances of falling out of remission are 85 percent. It&rsquo;s like walking around with a bomb strapped to you, never knowing when Mr. Cancer&rsquo;s going to press the button. It&rsquo;s the reason I have kept my power port installed in my left arm - I beat the odds the first time with CRC 4A. I am not going to coddle myself with pretty pictures and inspirational 'beat cancer&rsquo; twaddle. I am going to live as if every second I have is a gift.</p><p>She&rsquo;s right.</p><p>The sky is bluer.</p>
