I have to talk about something because I realize I haven't yet (it's about biology)

<p>I have to talk about something because I realize I haven&rsquo;t yet (it&rsquo;s about biology)</p><!-- more --><p>Oxyphil cells are super weird little guys that I learned about while looking at histology slides for anatomy (this was back when I thought I wanted to do nursing). We don&rsquo;t know their function so they&rsquo;re kind of a mystery! </p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="530" data-orig-width="1080"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/052e57cb26b302410e73a7498a03a596/1861bbf008b5529a-7f/s640x960/3ca2fcfe3fe204cd2d665bc9d4f8c739c91b259d.png" data-orig-height="530" data-orig-width="1080" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/052e57cb26b302410e73a7498a03a596/1861bbf008b5529a-7f/s75x75_c1/74f5b295c7ccdb891e526d8b0906416eae93b21b.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/052e57cb26b302410e73a7498a03a596/1861bbf008b5529a-7f/s100x200/bd41ee3dafd3171ec08e161c2ae5e58a56637bba.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/052e57cb26b302410e73a7498a03a596/1861bbf008b5529a-7f/s250x400/39033d1140e1d6f6076145bf7c856f02f550ffb7.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/052e57cb26b302410e73a7498a03a596/1861bbf008b5529a-7f/s400x600/bf0b84103b49b26caea37b9f542a597f0a38c03b.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/052e57cb26b302410e73a7498a03a596/1861bbf008b5529a-7f/s500x750/516f98395bd4203489b86dde6debeee8d0ba2c1e.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/052e57cb26b302410e73a7498a03a596/1861bbf008b5529a-7f/s540x810/246843e7fc38142f7858db15386615c988070c75.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/052e57cb26b302410e73a7498a03a596/1861bbf008b5529a-7f/s640x960/3ca2fcfe3fe204cd2d665bc9d4f8c739c91b259d.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/052e57cb26b302410e73a7498a03a596/1861bbf008b5529a-7f/s1280x1920/0f3c1d869ad907c9d22861d07503316b1378b7bd.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"/></figure></div><p>They mostly start to appear after reaching puberty and then increase in number as we age. They&rsquo;re also known as oncocytes (<i>onco</i> meaning mass or bulk + <i>cytes</i> meaning mature cell) but they go by a bunch of more specific names depending on their location. Plants don&rsquo;t have them btw but we do and so do other animals. They have bigger mitochondria that act like gymrats on steroids and more of them compared to the average cell. Apparently they even have more mitochondria than the cells that make up your muscle tissues, which is insane since you can imagine how many powerhouses it would take to fuel muscle activity. I tried to find a vid to show what they look like and I think this youtuber does a good job at that </p><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="youtube" data-url="https://youtu.be/crwGfnWKEZ8?si=EKEnNUqMIcVlBFGM" data-orig-width="267" data-orig-height="200"><iframe width="267" height="200" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/crwGfnWKEZ8?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Histopathology Parathyroid--Oxyphil adenoma"></iframe></figure><p>Sometimes benign (as in unlikely or slow spread, not cancerous), sometimes malignant (as in spreads like wildfire, cancerous). They&rsquo;re literally just tumor cells, which would make sense since oncology is the study of cancer. </p><p>The reason they have so many overpowered powerhouses (still talking about mitochondria) is because they require a LOT of energy breakdown. Your body&rsquo;s cells love love love carbs (like sugar) so much that it prioritizes using them over other nutrients to make stored energy readily available for uses like muscle contractions. </p><p>The inefficient way to break down sugar (caused by oxygen-deprived conditions) is kinnnnd ooooof like an Italian grandma making tomato sauce from tomatoes. When Grandma&rsquo;s tomatoes enter into the sauce-ification machine, it has two exits. One exit spews tomato sauce and the other is where all the separated seeds and skin go. Sometimes Grandma pops the seedy skin bits back into the top of the machine to get a little extra out. The oxyphil&rsquo;s mitochondria work like Grandma&rsquo;s machine! Stored sugar (the tomato) goes in and some usable energy called ATP (tomato sauce) comes out while also making this other byproduct (the seeds and skin). That waste/byproduct, pyruvate, can be reabsorbed by the mitochondria to make even more energy in oxygen-deprived environments, producing lactic acid. This localized lactic acid literally makes your body more acidic but your body is usually pretty good at flushing it out (fyi drinking water helps with this process&hellip; This is also why they tell people to drink lots of water after getting a swedish massage). </p><p>In the case that it isn&rsquo;t clearing itself out enough for whatever reason, like say maybe you consistently produce so fucking much lactic acid because you have a tumor with MANY overpowered af mitochondria&hellip;. Well&hellip; You might be pretty acidic there. Good news is you can raise your body&rsquo;s pH to be more alkaline via deep breathing (this would make your body oxygen-rich so that you can break down sugars more efficiently). You can also eat more alkaline foods like red cabbage and leafy greens. </p><p>Anyways that&rsquo;s all I know about oxyphils and I wish we knew why they exist. It feels so cynical to think they exist just to cause death and I don&rsquo;t really believe that anyways since not everyone gets cancer. Are oxyphils how the body adapts to make more energy readily available in oxygen-deprived conditions, resulting in acidosis? Does that acidity break down neighboring cell walls? Does that mean they permeate the cell membrane and get that healthy neighboring cell to start dysfunctioning too and the cycle continues? Also why aren&rsquo;t they present at birth??? If it&rsquo;s true that they come from chief cells then they wouldn&rsquo;t really have a chance to form since chief cells are also not rly present at birth. Food for thought! I just want to know their function and have been for like two years blaaaahhhhh</p><p>Also here is a video of how a grandma makes her tomato sauce. She doesn&rsquo;t put the seedy skin bits back into the machine but some people do. I hope it helps with the analogy </p><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="youtube" data-url="https://youtu.be/4RwuSZDl_do?si=eOP2L1ENIRkrXu27" data-orig-width="356" data-orig-height="200"><iframe width="356" height="200" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RwuSZDl_do?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Italian Grandma Makes Canned Tomato Puree"></iframe></figure>
