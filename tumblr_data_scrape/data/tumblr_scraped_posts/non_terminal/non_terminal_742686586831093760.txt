February 6th I was diagnosed with colon cancer and February the 16th I underwent surgery to remove the tumors. We are still waiting on the test results on whether i’m 100% cancer free. In the meantime i would really really appreciate it if you could donate or like and reblog. Even if you don’t have the funds now sharing the link can be a life changer. Im still on a lease for 4 months, im financing a car and im not currently able to move around or walk without pain which makes a full time job out of the picture. Those of you who know my irl know i don’t ask for much and wouldnt be doing this if it wasn’t super important. So please please share🙏🏿💛</p>
