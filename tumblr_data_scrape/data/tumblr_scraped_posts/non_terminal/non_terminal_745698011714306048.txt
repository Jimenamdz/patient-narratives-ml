Making your cancer diagnosis public is A Lot — Sean Curry

<blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>I couldn’t keep going back to that first moment all over again. And I was diagnosed with a relatively straightforward, well-understood form of cancer, at a time in my life when I was in excellent physical shape to fight it. Had this happened twenty years ago, with the science at the time, or twenty years later, in an older body, the news might’ve been different.<br/><br/>Larger than all that, however, was the actual crossing of the threshold: going from “not someone who has cancer” to “someone who has cancer.” Everyone I hadn’t told yet was someone who had unconsciously sorted me into the group of people who had never had cancer. <br/><br/>Or, perhaps, it was more about me: before I told someone, inside their mind existed a world where I didn’t have cancer. Telling them would change that world, and the version of me that was inside it, forever.<br/><br/>It wasn’t that it was hard, or emotionally taxing, or devastating to tell people. It was that every time I told someone, another world in which I didn’t have cancer ended, almost as if I was giving myself cancer all over again.</p></blockquote><p>I wrote about Kate Middleton&rsquo;s cancer announcement, my own cancer diagnosis (3 years in remission now), and how we maybe should all extend each other a bit more grace.</p><p>I hope you&rsquo;ll give it a read.</p><p class="npf_link" data-npf='{"type":"link","url":"https://www.sean-curry.com/blog/kate-middleton-cancer-diagnosis","display_url":"https://www.sean-curry.com/blog/kate-middleton-cancer-diagnosis","title":"Making your cancer diagnosis public is A Lot — Sean Curry","description":"Even, and probably especially, for literal princesses.","site_name":"Sean Curry","poster":[{"media_key":"1b5b7e540c158bb3cfb01a4902b1cef3:ea1a55895f60f7f1-b5","type":"image/jpeg","width":1200,"height":630}]}'><a href="https://www.sean-curry.com/blog/kate-middleton-cancer-diagnosis" target="_blank">Making your cancer diagnosis public is A Lot — Sean Curry</a></p>
