<p>Howdy folks, I am (un)officially cancer free for the first time likely since I was about 18! I’ve been dealing with all of this since I noticed a lump on my 23rd birthday in August last year; I spent my Christmas getting surgery and my Easter is being spent recovering from my first (and hopefully last) radioactive iodine treatment. And yesterday my doctor told me that by some miracle, even though my cancer had remained undetected for much longer than average, I didn’t show any signs of metastases. I have faced so many of my fears in the last year, and it is just such a relief to know that this is over, that I can finally rest and return to normal, that I won’t have to take any more unnecessary time off work. It all just feels like a miracle, which is mostly thanks to the amazing doctors I had through Cleveland Clinic. So yeah, just remember to celebrate life, you never know when you’re going to find a lump that changes everything for you. But also, if you do find that lump, or you already have, please know that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
