Cancer... The big C.

<h1>Cancer&hellip; The big C.</h1><p>I am distrustful of doctors and until recently did not frequent them for routine maintenance. I had a lot of negative experiences with them and never had anything severely physically wrong with me. Not even my wisdom teeth needed to be removed. </p><p>By chance, I got the right doctor. By chance, she had had the same cancer around my age. By chance, she asked me if we had ever done an ultrasound of my thyroid while I was getting my annual pap. I had 0 symptoms. I was stage 1. By chance, I got the right surgeon. I am not in any pain and haven&rsquo;t been since day 1 of recovery in the hospital. I might not even need the radiation, and if I do, it&rsquo;s just a pill that specifically goes after thyroid cells. So here I am a week after surgery, my thyroid removed and my cancer hopefully gone. </p><p>There is no way, that if the incredibly specific set of events in my life hadn&rsquo;t happened I would have discovered my cancer before it was symptomatic and potentially metastasized into my lymph nodes, that I would have been told my life expectancy wouldn&rsquo;t change because of my prognosis.</p><p>So I am grateful for my struggles and suffering. I am grateful for living in abusive households for so long, and for having mental disabilities that caused me to work myself to severe burnout every few years. For my nearly constant panic attacks since 2021. I&rsquo;m grateful that my shitty ex broke up with me a month before surgery after 4 years together because he wasn&rsquo;t willing to put in the time or effort to be there for me. I am grateful for my cancer. I am grateful not just because these things made me stronger, but because they were absolutely necessary for my story to be where it is right now.</p><p>For the first time in my life, I feel like I&rsquo;m exactly where I&rsquo;m meant to be. I&rsquo;ve worked hard to improve myself and get myself ready for the good things to come. Because they will. I am confident in it. And for me, as cliche as it is, it&rsquo;s starting with being cancer-free. </p><p>I know I got really lucky. I know that other people will have much more difficult situations to soldier through but I hope my story might help them through their own struggles.</p><p>I have an audience of 0. I don&rsquo;t expect anyone to see this but I hope someone that needs to does. I promise hope is out there. No one thinks to tell you that you have to make it though. Make your hope, even if it comes from something utterly silly. I promise it is worth it. </p>
