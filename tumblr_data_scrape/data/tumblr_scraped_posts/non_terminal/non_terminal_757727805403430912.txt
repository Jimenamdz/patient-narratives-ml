It could be something very simple, but I do think having it be intentional is what you’re doing to help honor this person.”</p><p>In a column for SurvivorNet, New York-based clinical psychologist <a href="https://strongintherapy.com/aboutme" target="_blank">Dr. Marianna Strongin</a> expressed that it may be helpful to remind yourself that these feelings are “meaningful yet temporary.”</p><p>“If you approach them with compassion, kindness, and eventually acceptance, you will come away from this period in your life more connected to your resilience and strength,” Dr. Strongin added.</p><h2><b>Understanding Metastatic Breast Cancer</b></h2><p>Stage 4, or metastatic breast cancer, means that the cancer has spread to distant areas of the body. Even though there is currently no cure for metastatic breast cancer, doctors have many options to treat this advanced stage of breast cancer.</p><p>Hormone therapy, chemotherapy and targeted drugs are all options to talk to her doctor about, depending on your individual needs. Sometimes surgery and/or radiation is considered as part of the treatment, but mainly it is important to focus on improving your quality of life.</p><p><a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/erica-l-mayer" target="_blank">Dr. Erica Mayer</a>, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, says clinical trials have shown that hormone medicines are more effective when paired with targeted therapies. At some point, chemotherapy will be introduced. And according to Dr. Mayer, it’s delivered at a dose and schedule that’s as well-tolerated as possible.</p><p>“We are so lucky in breast cancer that we have so many effective and well-tolerated treatments,” Dr. Mayer previously told SurvivorNet. I’m so gratified to see that patients are doing better and living longer today with metastatic breast cancer than they have ever done before.”</p><p>Bottom line, there are more and more options becoming available for patients to manage symptoms of advanced stage disease, and it’s best to talk about specific treatment plans and what is best for you with your own doctor.</p><h2><b>Treating Metastatic Breast Cancer</b></h2><p>With metastatic breast cancer, the primary goal of treatment is to control its spread. SurvivorNet offers information about what those options are from targeted therapies to chemotherapy and when these various treatment options can be used.</p><p>We also provide information on new, exciting research that is currently being tested in clinical trials and information about when recently approved drugs, like immunotherapies, can be used.</p><p>For help finding a clinical trial that may be right for you or a loved one, try our easy-to-use <a href="https://www.survivornet.com/clinical-trial-finder/" target="_blank">Clinical Trial Finder</a>.</p><p>While there have been many developments in recent years when it comes to treating late-stage breast cancer, which therapies can be used will depend on the characteristics of the patient’s cancer.</p><p><i><a href="https://www.survivornet.com/articles/overview-treatment-options-late-stage-breast-cancer/" target="_blank">What are the treatment options for late-stage breast cancer?</a></i></p><p>“Metastatic breast cancer is a treatable disease,” <a href="https://doctors.lifebridgehealth.org/provider/kenneth-miller/2514829" target="_blank">Dr. Kenneth D.
