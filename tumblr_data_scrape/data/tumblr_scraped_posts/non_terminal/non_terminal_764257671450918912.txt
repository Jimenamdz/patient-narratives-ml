I was chronically ill and wished for a place of positivity for an interest of mine that was misunderstood. A nice little escape where I was no one.<br/><br/>Cancer mention below:</p><!-- more --><p>A year after I originally made this blog, I was diagnosed with cancer.<br/>I went through surgeries, and then radioactive treatment, which my body unfortunately reacted badly to, breaking tissues it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to, and leaving me disabled with permanent severe pain and nausea. I tried to get surgery and treatment in an attempt to fix it, but it only made it worse.<br/><br/>Though that being said, I should be safe and cancer free.<br/>And luckily I was approved for early retirement this year due to my poor quality of life. I am definitely the youngest retired person I know<br/><br/>During these years I also tried to spend time with terminally ill loved ones, who unfortunately didn&rsquo;t win the fight against cancer.<br/><br/>My heart goes out to anyone who has dealt with cancer one way or another. My life will never be the same, but I will forever cherish the moments I shared with the ones I loved.</p>
