Tags: Cancer, I say things like cure, But it's more like getting me to No Evidence of Disease, Once you reach stage IV people are hesitant to use the word cure because cancer cells are now roaming the body, But you can be NED for decades and never have a reccurance so that's what I'm hoping for

Oh shit! I haven't done a cancer update in a bit.

<p>Oh shit! I haven&rsquo;t done a cancer update in a bit.</p><p>So I have that temporary illeostomy to keep my colon intact until they go in and resect it, and it&rsquo;s a pain. I should be able to go several days with a bag but right now I&rsquo;m going through several bags in a day. I&rsquo;ve got WOC (wound and ostomy clinic) nurses on the case though, so hopefully we&rsquo;ll get a handle on that soon.</p><p>I saw my medical oncologist and he&rsquo;s got me in for a CT scan tomorrow. That&rsquo;s because I start chemo next week and they want a baseline snapshot, so they can watch the tumor shrink.</p><p>Next Thursday I start 6 cycles of FOLFOX, which is a lot less than I&rsquo;d expected, but the chemo is to shrink things and clean up the margins of the primary tumour and mets so they&rsquo;re more easily removed by the surgeon, and my primary tumour is already pretty localized. As the oncologist said, it&rsquo;s the surgery that cures the cancer, not the chemo. I&rsquo;m guessing they think that if the chemo goes well, I&rsquo;ll get to where they need me to be in 3 months rather than 6 or more.</p><p>Anyhow, I&rsquo;m unreasonably excited for the poisoning to begin! Time to put the run to the cancer. </p>
