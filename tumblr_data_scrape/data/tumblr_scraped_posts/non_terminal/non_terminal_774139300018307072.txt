<p>Right now is a very weird time to have cancer while queer. The president unleashes new horrors on my country every day. My queer community is under attack. But I can&rsquo;t really engage with it, because I have fucking cancer. </p><p>Part of me really wants to minimize that. Like, it&rsquo;s stage 1. It&rsquo;s very treatable. I am not going to die (I mean, eventually I will. We all will. But you know what I mean). But. I have cancer. I need chemotherapy. If ever there was a time when my job as a human being is to focus on me, this is it.</p><p>I just have to trust that there will still be a world to help save when I&rsquo;m on the other side of this.</p><p>(I never really post here, just reblog other people&rsquo;s stuff. But I really need to share this thought with someone, and unknown people on the internet feel like the right audience, somehow)</p>
