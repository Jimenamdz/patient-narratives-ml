So...I had breast cancer. And it was terrible. And whatever is left is...also terrible.

And it was terrible. And whatever is left is&hellip;also terrible. </p><p>I did everything I was supposed to. I went to the doctor and got my scans. They found a &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; spot but after an ultrasound I was cleared and worry-free. Eight months later I was diagnosed with Stage 3A Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. I was so angry, but mostly terrified. </p><p>Everything about early diagnosis is awful. All of the scans and tests are incredibly painful, which I really didn&rsquo;t expect. The biopsy consisted of me holding a young nurses hand and her crying with me while the doctor basically stabbed a nail through my breast to collect tumor tissue. It hurt so badly. Then, when I had my first MRI, I was lying face down but on a ramp with my breasts hanging down. Unnatural and also, of course, incredibly painful. I was just started to call out and ask them to please stop when Justin Bieber&rsquo;s Stay came on the headphones and I didn&rsquo;t feel all alone anymore. </p><p>I knew that I immediately wanted my breasts gone. Both of them, gone. Immediately. It didn&rsquo;t matter that my right breast hadn&rsquo;t betrayed me, my killer left boob had made the decision for both of them. Two weeks after diagnosis I had my double mastectomy. I was so pitiful after that that I even made the nurses cry. I had a male nurse come in and check on me the next day and he told me he&rsquo;d gone home crying. I must have been awful. Thankfully, I don&rsquo;t remember it. I think most of it was because they wouldn&rsquo;t let my (then) four year old in to see me. I did get to see my two older boys though, thank goodness. </p><p>My friends dyed my hair a beautiful pink. I had never dyed my hair before and I was so happy with the outcome. I could have kept that beautiful color forever. </p><p>I went straight into chemo. The Red Devil was every two weeks and at one point I remember sitting in my kitchen wondering if I was dying. I think I probably was. I was also bald now. No nose hair, no eyebrows or eyelashes, nothing. I looked like a turtle. But I was too sick to really care. I didn&rsquo;t even mind the Neulasta shot every two weeks. </p><p>I moved on into Taxol, and it was actually just as bad for me. During this time I was put into the ICU with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs (MANY), and was on oxygen for months. The night before I was hospitalized I told my middle son I felt like I was being stabbed in the back, but hey. It was just massive blood clots. *sigh*</p><p>After chemo I found out that I now have Lymphedema. If you know what Lymphedema is, you know how terrible this is. If you don&rsquo;t, let me just tell you- it&rsquo;s so terrible. When I had my double mastectomy they also removed 39 of my lymph nodes under my left arm and six of them were cancerous. And now the fluid doesn&rsquo;t drain from my arm and gets stuck in my arm and chest and neck and I am miserable. I did treatement and have a pump and wear sleeves and all that, but it is still miserable. </p><p>At the end of chemo and beginning of radiation I bought a house. I want you to know I remember none of it. But I love it. :) </p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting radiation to be bad but of course it was awful. Nothing about cancer is fun. The burns burned. The skin broke. The pain pained. My stomach did NOT stomach. It was truly terrible. </p><p>After that I had a year of injections. And a total hysterectomy. And pills. And bone pain, depression, anxiety, nightmares, hot flashes, and, finally, heart surgery. </p><p>It was a hell of a couple of years. And if they&rsquo;d diagnosed it when I got my first mammogram, I don&rsquo;t think half of it would have happened. </p><p>What&rsquo;s happening now, though, is that cancer never really left me. It&rsquo;s always on my mind and in my thoughts. With every pain and ache I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s back to get me. I hope that this anxiety and fear eventually leave me. </p><p>Please get your scans and check ups when they&rsquo;re due. Take every step you need to take. You want to stick around, even when things look bleak. There&rsquo;s always a better day coming. </p>
