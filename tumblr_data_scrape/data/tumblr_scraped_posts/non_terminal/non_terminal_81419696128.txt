Hello!

<p>It&rsquo;s been really hard for me to maintain this blog but I would like to write about my experiences post-treatment, so expect to see a few more blog entries! </p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about cancer and endings over the past few weeks. One of my neighbours died at the beginning of March - his organs started failing and he passed away as a result. He was really kind to me during my treatment and kept encouraging me to keep going despite the horrible side effects of chemotherapy. He told me that we&rsquo;d get through it together and he planned on living until at least 90. Another one of my neighbours has just been diagnosed with breast cancer and I keep finding myself passing on all the maxims he taught me over to her. He was a lovely person and he will be sorely missed. </p>



<p>It makes me stop and appreciate the fact that I&rsquo;m alive, I&rsquo;ve survived, I&rsquo;m doing really well; I&rsquo;m so grateful to be in the position I am now. Not just the fact that I survived chemotherapy &amp; cancer but that I&rsquo;m better mentally. I re-read all my posts and I could see how I became more and more depressed and hollow by my posts and lack of posts. I&rsquo;ve just finished a 12 week course of cancer counselling therapy and it&rsquo;s helped me so much. My counsellor taught me that it&rsquo;s okay to have feelings and it&rsquo;s okay to be tolerant of myself. I&rsquo;ll talk about it in more detail at a later stage because some of the tips and tricks he taught me are really useful, regardless of whether you&rsquo;ve had cancer.</p>



<p>On Thursday I have my first check-up since my last chemotherapy. To say I&rsquo;m scared and worried is to put it mildly. I keep having crazy nightmares where my neck is covered in lumps! I&rsquo;ve found it really useful to <a href="https://www.lymphomas.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdfs/Follow-up-appointments-a-guide-for-people-with-lymphoma.pdf">read this booklet</a> about the process when you go for a follow-up appointment. In fact, the website has some pretty <a href="https://www.lymphomas.org.uk/about-lymphoma/download-or-order-information">good booklets on lymphoma in general</a> - definitely worth a look whatever stage you&rsquo;re at.</p>



<p>So allegedly lymphoma has a higher chance of coming back within the first 2 years of remission - that&rsquo;s going to be a very stressful two years! The booklet also said that most people know that they have cancer because the signs start to come back. I&rsquo;m probably going to regret saying this, but I think I&rsquo;m okay. I have scar tissue from my main lump but it hasn&rsquo;t changed size in the past three months except for a few days when that side of my neck was a little swollen. I&rsquo;ve also recently been pretty tired over the past few weeks, but I think that&rsquo;s a combination of getting up super early to do extra shifts at work and being stressed out about my upcoming appointments.</p>



<p>Nothing will stop me worrying about it (if people didn&rsquo;t worry about appointments then that would be a cause for concern, don&rsquo;t you think?) but I&rsquo;m going not going to let it overwhelm me. I&rsquo;ll let you know more after I&rsquo;ve had my appointment.</p>
