<p>I&rsquo;ve been stuck for a few months now, not just about what to write, but about what to do.  In May, I found out my 6 month check up scan was still clear of any signs of lymphoma.  Last time I was in remission, my 6 month scan was when I found out the cancer was back, so this meant going into uncharted territory. Glorious, cancer free, uncharted territory.</p>

<p>But I still wasn&rsquo;t off the hook. The scan results also showed pneumonia in one of my lungs, landing me in the hospital for four days, a not so gentle reminder that, cancer or not, my immune system still isn&rsquo;t what it used to be.  During those days I finally accepted where I am now, where I&rsquo;ve been since February or so: Remission Puberty.  </p>

<p>Stay with me now, I know that sounds strange, but it makes sense to me. It&rsquo;s the awkward stage between being sick and well, and, like the awkward phase you go through in middle school, it&rsquo;s confusing and frustrating and it sucks.  It&rsquo;s having enough energy to go to classes but not having enough to keep up with the homework.  It&rsquo;s feeling well enough to go to a party one night, and then spending the entire next weekend watching Netflix because your potassium levels are running low for some reason.  It&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be fine, but it&rsquo;s probably safer not to do it,&rdquo; when you ask your doctor about almost anything.  It&rsquo;s almost impossible to successfully navigate, and confuses everyone around you just as much as it does you. Basically, it sucks.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s still where I&rsquo;m stuck, but I&rsquo;ve decided it&rsquo;s time to get out. My doctor advised that, if possible, I not take a job or internship this summer, and instead work on my health and getting myself to what I&rsquo;m now calling Remission Adulthood. I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be in a position where I could take his advice, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.  And it&rsquo;s hard.  It&rsquo;s hard to know if it&rsquo;s good that I&rsquo;m spending all day watching Bob&rsquo;s Burgers because my body needs the rest or if I should be pushing myself to get out of bed every single day.  It&rsquo;s hard to know if pushing my lungs to get me through an 8 mile hike is a good way to build their stamina or if it&rsquo;s just completely dangerous.  I have to ask myself these kind of questions every day, because the answer is usually never the same. But I&rsquo;m getting better at figuring out the right one.</p>

<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I&rsquo;m still in Remission Puberty, but I&rsquo;m ready to get out. It&rsquo;s time for Adolescence, at the very least.  So I&rsquo;m back, and I should be posting more often now, because a big part of getting to where I want to be is getting back to writing, and not just about cancer anymore.</p>

<p>Tl;Dr: I&rsquo;m bad at being a kind of sick person, but I&rsquo;m getting better.   </p>
