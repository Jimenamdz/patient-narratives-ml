Remission.

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that nobody cares, but, I am reaching 8 months in remission. On the day that I reach 8 months is the day I get results that determine that I have cancer again or not so it&rsquo;s a bittersweet day approaching. Cancer is a horrible, evil illness and even though there are those that I supremely hate, I would never wish this infection on anyone.</p>
