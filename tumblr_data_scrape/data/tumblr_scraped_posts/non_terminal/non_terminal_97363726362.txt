<p>Well guys, I did it.  I finished my first week of class.  More importantly, I&rsquo;m back at school.</p>

<p>So far, 2014 hasn&rsquo;t been a good year.  I had to get treated for cancer and stop school.  Chris was one of the victims in Isla Vista.  Then there&rsquo;s things happening everywhere else&ndash;ISIS, Robin Williams, Ferguson&hellip;  But then even small things with friends and family (relationships falling apart, relatives getting older or sicker).  In general, there has just been a certain sadness about (and anger, it would seem).</p>

<p>So while I&rsquo;m in remission and healthy enough to be across the country for school, I am painfully aware of my fortune in being alive.  Why is it that I, who was diagnosed with cancer, get to return to school when Chris, who was going out to grab dinner, does not?  What are the odds that out of everyone, he would be fatally shot, and that a cancer patient would outlive him?  More than ever, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what do I do with the time I have?  I know we all ask ourselves that, and I wish that I now had a more direct path to follow, or some great answer.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t.  I plan to make the most out of myself this semester as a film student, though.  I still plan to work with kids who have cancer when I can.  I hope that I will find a way to make my &ldquo;survival&rdquo; more worthwhile.</p>
