February 19, 2015

<p>On February 14th, I was officially one year cancer free. It&rsquo;s a big deal, I know, but hold your applause. It was a date I almost missed, a date that went along without any pomp or circumstance, because I am not &ldquo;better&rdquo;. </p><p>Don&rsquo;t panic. This isn&rsquo;t a post to let you all know that I&rsquo;ve relapsed (again) or that some other scary disease (I&rsquo;m looking at you UCLA superbug) has taken over my body. This is a post to talk about something I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, but definitely not enough. Being cancer free does not mean being &ldquo;better.&rdquo;</p><p>On February 3rd I woke up at 6am because I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I&rsquo;d had a sore throat for a few days that I&rsquo;d been ignoring, but that morning I had no choice but to acknowledge that something was wrong. There was a pain in both my lungs, so sharp, that it was almost impossible for me to get in any air. I took my temperature, 101. I called my cancer center, who told me to call an ambulance. I called 911 for the first time in my life (surprising, I know), and was taken to the closet ER. </p><p>Here, I need to go off track for a moment, and talk about how privileged I have been to have received treatment from some of the top hospitals in the world. I&rsquo;ve always known how lucky I am to be treated in world class hospitals by doctors who are not just brilliant, but kind, doctors who listen to their patients. In the ER of a downtown Los Angeles hospital (which I&rsquo;m not naming because I don&rsquo;t want to get sued or something, I don&rsquo;t know how this works) I received a sharp awakening call. I told them my medical history (all while still fighting to breathe) and explained that something similar had happened before and that a very specific pain medication would eradicate the problem long enough to start looking for what was wrong with me. They ignored me. I listened to them repeat my medical history incorrectly (&ldquo;she had some kind of transplant&rdquo; &ldquo;they removed a tumor from her chest&rdquo;) without the breath to correct them.  I sat in a hallway while patients with various illnesses walked around me, and no one offered me a mask, despite my insistence that I have an autoimmune disorder. When my IV was accessed, the nurse didn&rsquo;t cap it properly, and blood poured from the tube until I brought it to his attention. When my regular oncologist found out where I was he told me to tell them I was feeling better so I could be discharged immediately, and to come to the center at Cedars. The doctor wrote me a prescription for a fucking ZPAK and sent me on my way.</p><p>I made it to my hospital and have never been happier to see such friendly, competent faces. People who know me and care about me. I will never stop reiterating how grateful I am to these men and women who take such good care of me. I was given the proper medicines, admitted to the hospital, and eventually diagnosed with RSV, a respiratory virus only children get (my immune system still isn&rsquo;t fully grown up yet). I was in the hospital just over a week, missing 7 classes. But then came the fun part, recovery. Because when you leave the hospital you aren&rsquo;t just &ldquo;better.&quot; </p><p>For 3 days I sat in bed watching Netflix while Ben (my wonderful, wonderful boyfriend) made me soup and brought me tissues and let me cry when I got frustrated because just walking to the kitchen felt like running a half marathon. We had plans to go to Palm Springs that weekend for Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and despite my poor health, we decided to keep those plans. My doctor even said, as if I were a 1970&rsquo;s housewife, that a break from all the smog and stress of the city would be wonderful for my health. So we went. And we came back. And I still wasn&rsquo;t able to go to my classes this week. And that is where things get tricky.</p><p>Being &quot;better&rdquo; is all about perception. A weekend in Palm Spring should mean I&rsquo;m well, right? I posted pictures of us laying by the pool, we even went out to dinner one night. I must be fine! But that&rsquo;s not how it works. That hour by the pool was the only time I got out of bed that day, and after dinner? After dinner I had to wait in the car while Ben made a Ralph&rsquo;s run because I felt like I was going to pass out if I walked more than 20 steps. </p><p>I have a bad habit of posting my good days on social media. Or maybe its a good habit, because I post the days I want to remember. But the problem is that every day is not an Instagram post.  I&rsquo;ve had to bail on birthday dinners and friendly brunches because I literally can&rsquo;t get out of bed without falling over, and I&rsquo;ve gotten responses like &ldquo;you were fine last weekend&rdquo; or &ldquo;you seemed okay when you were drinking that sangria the other night.&rdquo; Some days I wake up and feel great and go for a jog (I&rsquo;m kidding, that part never happens) and make it to all my classes and do all my homework and have dinner with friends and pay all my bills on time, but some days I wake up and everything hurts and just getting out of bed to pee feels like the hardest thing in the world. So no, I am not &ldquo;better.&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;m posting today because all of this really came to a head this morning. I was planning on going back to classes today, I even made an appointment to  meet with one of my professors before class (Dane, if you&rsquo;re reading this, I&rsquo;m sorry and I&rsquo;m emailing you next). I didn&rsquo;t get as much work done as I wanted to yesterday but I was still feeling okay. I woke up early to do some more this morning and about an hour in I started to panic. What if it wasn&rsquo;t enough? What if I never caught up? What if I tried to walk to class and passed out on the way because I hadn&rsquo;t tried walking that far yet? What if I passed out IN class? What if something happened and I wound up back in that emergency room? And so, I had a panic attack. I cried in the shower for 15 minutes and tried to calm myself down but I couldn&rsquo;t breathe and couldn&rsquo;t make it stop so I took a xanax and just kept shaking and crying until it kicked in and I fell back asleep. And I missed another day of classes. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t want this to be a sad post. I don&rsquo;t want this to be a pity post. Because I am <i>getting </i>better. I&rsquo;m just not there yet. So when I cancel on plans or don&rsquo;t answer your text for a week (or never) and then insist that I&rsquo;m doing fine when I run into you on campus, just keep in mind that my recovery is a lot of things, but black and white isn&rsquo;t one of them.   <i> </i>        </p>
