<a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/msgNeI7-PAsbZI3fkFWnQXA">@vaguely-positive</a> please don’t mock and promote bulimia, it’s a serious eating disorder. Not something that you should feel “happy” about when you purge and starve.</blockquote>

<p>Like I can help how I feel? I’m simple just expressing my emotions. Not “mocking” or “promoting”. I don’t recall telling anyone else to follow my bad habit.</p></blockquote>

<p>How about people stop going to the blogs of people with eating disorders trying to police and demonize them bc they don’t fit your ideal of how you expect them to be on the internet?</p></blockquote>

<p>How about not promoting and mocking eating disorders? As far as I can see, this person doesn’t even have an eating disorder, even if they did it still gives them NO right to promote it. I’m not  “policing and demonising” them because they “don’t fit my ideal of how I expect them to be on the internet” Tumblr staff literally say its against the guidelines to promote eating disorders and self harm.</p>
