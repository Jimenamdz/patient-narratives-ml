<a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/msgNeI7-PAsbZI3fkFWnQXA">@vaguely-positive</a> please don’t mock and promote bulimia, it’s a serious eating disorder. Not something that you should feel “happy” about when you purge and starve.</blockquote>

<p>Like I can help how I feel? I’m simple just expressing my emotions. Not “mocking” or “promoting”. I don’t recall telling anyone else to follow my bad habit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How about people stop going to the blogs of people with eating disorders trying to police and demonize them bc they don’t fit your ideal of how you expect them to be on the internet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How about not promoting and mocking eating disorders? As far as I can see, this person doesn’t even have an eating disorder, even if they did it still gives them NO right to promote it. I’m not  “policing and demonising” them because they “don’t fit my ideal of how I expect them to be on the internet” Tumblr staff literally say its against the guidelines to promote eating disorders and self harm.</p>

<p>You’re just seeing what you want to see, ignoring what she’s saying, and speaking over someone with a mental illness that shouldn’t have to explain themselves for having a safe space. <br/>Just going to block this baby before she continues to shit her diaper 👎.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I don’t think discussing eating disorders means they’re promoting them. They are SO stigmatized. Let’s stop that. Recovery is not fast, recovery is not easy, and recovery is not immediately. I don’t think that someone should be labeled as an eating disorder promoter just by voicing about how they feel. If I say that having the flu feels actually pretty good to lay in bed all day, am I promoting catching the flu? NO. Having an eating disorder was and is one of the hard at struggles I have ever battled in my life. If you have not lived through it, do not tell people who are how they should feel. Would you tell a veteran not to reminisce about a bloody war? Mental illness is NOT. A. CHOICE. “Illness” is the key word. Don’t preach about things you haven’t experienced! </p></blockquote>

<p>*sigh* so saying “I purge last night for the first time in a while. Honestly it felt so good to be hungry and empty after. I’ve gotten really bad with it in past but I’m gonna keep doing it.. I’m a little scared” isn’t promoting eating disorders then? I don’t have to have the “experience” of an eating disorder to “preach” what I know is right and wrong.</p>
