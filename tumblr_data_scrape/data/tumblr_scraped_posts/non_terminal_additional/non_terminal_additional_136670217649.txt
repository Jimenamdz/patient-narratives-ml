I've literally become so good at hiding how sick I truly am from most people. I try my hardest to put on a brave face and says"it could be worse" etc. but honestly, I'm scared. I'm scared of the way my body is attacking itself, I'm scared of little things that happen, I'm scared to go alone for simple tests such as MRIs etc.. I sit and wonder where the one brave young woman went. I get mad at myself for being ridiculous and having so much anxiety over simple tests. I get mad because I have allowed everyone to think I'm so much stronger and braver than I truly am. I'm just tired. I wish I wasn't as good at playing it off like I'm strong. At 23, I feel ridiculous having some of the fears I do about my declining health but I just can't help it. And honestly, if I hear "but you don't look sick" one more time I'm gonna be in a psych ward babbling to myself... Literally so frustrated with myself :(
