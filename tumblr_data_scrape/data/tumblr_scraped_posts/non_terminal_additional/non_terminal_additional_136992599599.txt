<p>I&rsquo;m 23, chronically ill, and can barely take care of myself at times. Yet, I&rsquo;m more of a mother to my 13 and 8 year old neighbors than theirs is. I seriously can&rsquo;t understand how or why their mother would do this to them. I can&rsquo;t see them hurt time and time again from this woman because I know first hand what it feels like. I just wish I wasn&rsquo;t sick because I would love to do more for these two. I try my best to be a role model and a woman of God so that they know how to act instead of what this world is teaching them. I don&rsquo;t think anything frustrates me more than this sigh.</p>
