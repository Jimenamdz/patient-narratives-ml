<p>Had a low pain day today. Decided it would be smart to take advantage of it. Cleaned my house, went to my best friends house and danced for a few hours, came home cooked a big dinner for my family and took a shower all big things. Guess what I&rsquo;m doing now? Feeling like I&rsquo;m dying because I have like negative 20'spoons. When will I learn?! Been sick 18 years and still haven&rsquo;t learned my lesson. Smh!</p>
