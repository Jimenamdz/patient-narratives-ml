<p>Decided to use Veet to save some spoons yesterday.. Big mistake! Super allergic to it. Went to the ER last night got sent home with Benedryl and a medrol pack. Today went to the doctor got cream and had 2 other meds added. Back to the doctor tomorrow for a follow up. These stupid hives seem to be getting worse instead of better. Literally so miserable ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
