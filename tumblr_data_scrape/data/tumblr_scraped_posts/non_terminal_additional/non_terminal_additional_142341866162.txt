Anxious

<p>Ugh. I woke up around 3am and haven&rsquo;t been able to get back to sleep. I have to get up for work in two hours. I hate insomnia. It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m off my painkillers finally (I was on them for eight months while battling leukemia) and even with a three week taper, I still had withdrawal symptoms. The worst of it is mostly over (stomach cramps, aches, restless legs) but I&rsquo;m still sneezing and yawning ALL THE TIME and I feel like I&rsquo;ll never sleep soundly again. I&rsquo;m anxious about everything. My blood pressure is literally higher, so there&rsquo;s that.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, a close family member AND friend have developed a bit of a heroin habit over the last few months. I not only have no real support system and nobody to talk to about my own difficulty getting off painkillers, but I have to deal with this. It&rsquo;s SO DIFFICULT to feel SO MISERABLE with that shit not only being at my fingertips but being offered to me. It&rsquo;s almost comical. I haven&rsquo;t ever taken any, nor do I want to. The only thing keeping me away from it is that I have a feeling I would *not* be a functioning heroin user. I strongly suspect that I would pretty quickly wind up dead or in rehab. I just know myself and how easily I develop a dependency on opiates. Heroin is a line that I just should never cross. It&rsquo;s scary that it has become such an easy thing to get. Like, these people I know that are using - I would never describe as addicts or anything. I guess they are now, but you&rsquo;d never know it. At the moment they are functioning and 100% in denial that there is even a problem. I doubt that will last forever though. </p>

<p>On top of all that drama, I can&rsquo;t stop worrying about my first follow up with my oncologist in June. Now that I&rsquo;m off the painkillers, the cancer saga finally feels over to me. It&rsquo;s sinking in, and I hardly know what to do with myself. I also am anxious about finally being able to TTC after that appointment (assuming I&rsquo;m still in remission). I&rsquo;m kind of dreading the fact that it feels like we&rsquo;re starting from square one. The nine months TTC before I was diagnosed with leukemia were just so damn depressing. I simultaneously can&rsquo;t wait. I want to believe so badly that this will be our year. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been distracting myself by reading lots of Malec fanfic. I have no idea why I became obsessed with this (I didn&rsquo;t even finish the books - and only started watching Shadowhunters with a mild interest).  I don&rsquo;t even usually gravitate towards slashy fanfic. They are just so ridiculously adorable though.</p>
