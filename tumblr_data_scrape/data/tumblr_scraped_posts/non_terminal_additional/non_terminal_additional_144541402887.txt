Why?

<p>I have recently found out that one of the sweetest people I have ever met in my life is sadly losing her long painful fight against cancer. Even through her illness she always makes people smile and tries her best to participate in everything like the other kids. She is a very strong girl, she has always been and has fought through her battle hard.Here’s a bit of her cancer story, Emma was nine years old when she was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer on 1st October 2012 after a short illness. She had an immediate surgery to release the pressure on her brain caused by the build up of fluids, and shortly afterwards had a second surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible. The second operation removed 30-50% of the squash ball sized tumour. Immediately after the second surgery Emma started a grueling course of radiation therapy which lasted six weeks. With a short break over the Christmas period to recuperate from the radiation therapy, Emma then commenced a six cycle chemotherapy regime that was to last seven months.The treatments were administered at British Columbia Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Vancouver. During the treatments the Emma&rsquo;s parents stayed for short and long periods at the Ronald McDonald House in Vancouver, often away from their son Charlie who was seven when Emma was first diagnosed.In August 2013 after further MRI scans, Emma and her family were told that Emma was in remission and that there was no evidence of cancer. Emma began her road to recovery from the ravages of the radiation and chemotherapy treatments, which had taken their toll on her body and mind.Emma seemed to be doing well, but in August 2104 started to have spells of being unwell, culminating in suspected meningitis. The illnesses did not recede with treatments, and as the family became more anxious further test were made. On 1st October 2014, exactly two years after the first diagnosis, Emma and her family were informed of the devastating news that cancer had been found in Emma&rsquo;s spine. Emma was officially in relapse and very ill. After a short round of radiation therapy Emma was once again placed into a chemotherapy regime. I know that I and many others are fearful she will not make it through. I am so sad that the amazing Emma hasn’t got to have a “normal” life and grow up without a worry but it seems that some of the most beautiful souls have to leave us behind  too early. I know she will remain with us in our hearts, minds and everything we do&hellip;&hellip;.. we love and will miss you Emma, thank you for all the great laughs and smiles&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;   if you would like to read more about her story or fund her campaign here is the link- <a href="http://gogetfunding.com/helpemma/">http://gogetfunding.com/helpemma/</a> </p>
