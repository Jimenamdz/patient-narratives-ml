Dear friends and family,

<p>Let me say things like &ldquo;If my cancer comes back&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;If my cancer stays away&rdquo; ect.</p>

<p>Because in all honesty, it can. </p>

<p>Let me have a plan. Let me expect the worst. What is the harm? If it doesn&rsquo;t come back, it doesn&rsquo;t. If it does, it won&rsquo;t be as devastating. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re constantly telling me, &ldquo;BUT ITS NOT GUNNA COME BACK&rdquo; </p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know that.</p>

<p>I am not exempt from my cancer coming back just cause you don&rsquo;t want it to. Just because you think I don&rsquo;t deserve it. Just because you think I&rsquo;ve been through enough.</p>

<p>I am not living in fear, I am prepared for anything. </p>

<p>What would you rather hear?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I thought this could happen and I am ready to do treatment x and y&rdquo; or <br/>
&ldquo;You kept telling me this wouldn&rsquo;t happen and I really thought it wouldn&rsquo;t! I really believed it was over! I can&rsquo;t think clearly enough to decide on treatment X or Y!&rdquo;</p>
