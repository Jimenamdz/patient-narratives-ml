My Battle With Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

I didn’t know how to react soon as I saw the CT scan results. All I know is my mom and my sister were crying, while my father was holding his emotions back, but the sadness was written all over his face. I went to my room because I didn’t want to breakdown in front of them. I couldn’t accept it. I was in denial for days. I don’t remember how many days it took for it to finally sink in. There were days when I’d wake up and think that it was just a nightmare… that I could still continue living my normal life. But I would always, always wake up to the reality that it wasn’t just a bad dream. That my cancer’s really back.</p><p>One of the reasons why I’m writing this post is because I learned that some people are feeling awkward towards me. Maybe because they don’t know the right words to say to me. Some people are curious and have a lot of questions about me having cancer, but couldn’t find the courage to ask me. Please know that this is still me. I had cancer, but cancer never had me! You can always talk to me or ask me anything. I won’t be bothered or be offended by it. But for now, I’m going to share my battle with cancer to you. I’ll just summarize it because it’s a very long story and I might start crying here if I go through the details.</p><p>My battle with cancer, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (a cancer that starts in white blood cells) to be specific, started when I was 15. It all began with a lump on my neck. It was fine needle aspirated, biopsied, but turned out negative. Then it was surgically removed. Biopsied again. Then positive! I have cancer… I, then, underwent treatment. I was in remission for <b>4 years</b>. Then as we all know, cancer’s a traitor…<b> it came back</b>.</p><p>At a very young age I’ve been through a lot already. Bone Marrow Biopsy was the worst experience ever! I can still vividly remember the excruciating pain I felt that time. I undergone neck surgery as mentioned above to remove the mass on my neck. And bronchoscopy to biopsy again the lymph nodes in my chest when my cancer recurred. I started getting used to the pain of inserting an IV line in my veins every now and then. One try is tolerable, but you know what chemo does to your veins. So there were times when they’d poke me more than once (5x max). And of course, chemotherapy. I had 4 cycles of chemo before + 6 cycles of chemo recently. Imagine going through those hellish sessions. Not to mention, 1 cycle is equivalent to 2 sessions! It was sooo tough. To me, the side effects of chemo were bone pain, muscle pain, body pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and sore veins. I was given after-chemo meds, like steroids, which made my face so swollen, and made me eat like a monster that’s why I gained so much weight. That evil drug caused me insomnia too. Of all the bad side effects of chemo &amp; other drugs, the good thing is that I didn’t lose my hair, it just thinned out a bit! But I experienced being bald too like other cancer patients. The first time I had HL I shaved my head before going through chemo so I know the feeling… I know how painful it is to lose your hair.</p><p>After 6 months of chemo, I am again in remission now. But the battle never ends here. It would take time for everything to fall into place: my body to return to its familiar shape, my immune system to function well again, my hair to grow after cutting it pixie style, my battle scars to fade. What they don’t tell you after cancer is that there are new struggles in the aftermath. There are times when I would look in the mirror and not like what I see. Post chemo side effects are not just physical, but psychological as well.</p><p><i>We, as cancer survivors, have a never-ending battle with the demons in our heads</i>. We are emotionally wrecked. After going through cancer, people might think that we are back to normal but we can never go back to our normal selves after such a life-altering fight for survival. The anxiety, depression and the fear haunt us every now and then. The <i>“scanxiety”</i> every PET/CT scan is horrible. This is so hard for us, especially the cancer patients and survivors of my age, because we are still young and we are just about to experience life and reach our dreams.</p><p>But then again, our new “normal” is much more rewarding because we surely did learn a lot. We learned how precious and fleeting life is, and that it is supposed to be treasured and enjoyed. That life is indeed short. That we are stronger than we know. That God can move mountains. That our families will do anything and everything for us. That health is more important than any material things in life. It made us appreciate the little things and be more grateful for every day. We also learned who our real friends are.</p><p>Through this battle I’ve met a lot of brave cancer warriors. I’m very thankful that I found a support group for cancer patients and survivors around my age, and made a lot of friends. It’s a blessing to have this kind of people around me who I can talk to because they are the ones who would understand me the most, knowing that they know exactly what I’ve been through. I couldn’t mention each and everyone of you, but co-warriors, you are all an inspiration to me. You guys are amazing. To anyone who knows someone battling cancer and in need of moral support, feel free to message me so I can introduce him/her to our small support group.</p><p>Now, I’m proud to say that<b> I A TWO-TIME CANCER SURVIVOR</b>. I am not my body. I’m not weak, fragile, or delicate or any other phrase that somehow describes the state of my whole physical self.<b> I am not my cancer, nor will I ever be. </b>So far, I have endured everything life throws at me. It hasn’t been easy. It was so devastating, but I’m still here…<b> TYPING, BREATHING, LIVING.</b> I will live my life to the fullest and I will not let cancer dictate me on how I should live my life. I will be vigilant but I will enjoy life.</p><p>I’m surrendering everything to God. My pains, my anxieties, my worries, and most importantly— my life. I’ll never lose faith that He would always restore me. I don’t know if I’ll relapse again. It’s scary, but I don’t want to worry anymore. Life is too short to be stressing over the things I can’t control. God has given me so much reasons to have faith in Him even when I don’t understand Him. And I will be faithful in Him even more when things are blurry and when things are not going my way.</p><p>Having cancer twice is physically, mentally and financially draining. My family and I are beyond thankful for Makati Shangri-La’s EMBRACE project for sponsoring my chemo drugs and other lab tests. I will forever be in awe of the people behind it. God really works in mysterious ways!</p><p>To you who are reading this, please don’t take your life, your HEALTH and the people around you for granted. Spend time with your family and friends. Always tell them how much you love them. And if you are struggling right now, whatever battle you are facing, always run to God and know that you are not alone.</p>
