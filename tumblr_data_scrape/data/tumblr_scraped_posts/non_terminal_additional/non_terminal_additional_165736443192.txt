Remission.

To be clear, the “c” word I speak of is cured.   We are a long way from that.  But like most of this I am not even sure what the really means anyway - this isn’t like I had pneumonia or the chicken pox.  All said though, all positive news!  In terms of next steps, I do have a scan scheduled as a part of my now diligent monitoring regimen in late December/Early January.  </p><p>This also happened to be a really good appointment from the conversation I was able to have with Dr. Desai. So much of the focus is (obviously) put on the physical removal of the cancer and to eradicate it’s chance of spreading - but now that we are past that piece currently, no one lives in a vacuum.  There are all kinds of outside elements that continue to influence and affect us as human beings.  Now, how do we go about fully assimilating back into normal every day life with those factors involved?  And that’s not to say that I have felt unassimilated.  More so however, with what is it going to take for one to operate in a healthy fashion within the new normal that will be continuing  dealing/thinking about things that people never having cancer, fortunately don’t have to experience?  These new realities aren’t as, he said, easy things to flip a switch to.  Instead, to think of this total recovery as a dimmer switch with a gradual turn up of light rather than the simple light switch of OFF then ON.  </p><p>My physical recovery is still something that is still very active - albeit for the most part internal.  As he again reminded me, we are just 3+ months since my last chemo treatment and just a month outside of this last surgery - the body, biologically, takes time to recover.  Much like training for a marathon, slow builds week over week over week is the key.  What’s funny is that as the doctor telling me this, I’ve heard this all before - from many places in life.  From personally in family &amp; friends, to professionally from bosses and all the way back to baseball coaches…basics of the road to success.  Incremental gains.  One brick at a time.  I suppose it is human to lose sight of this now and again.  What I realized however was, that in this rush to get to and feel 100%, I ended up losing sight of the gains that truly have been made.  That this, as he again reminded me, has only all just been slightly over a year.  A blip in the radar of life. </p><p>Once the all the physical is restored over the course of the next 6-18 months, the perpetual psychological journey continues.  Dr. Desai also gave me some really good tips today about the continued slow ramp up of exercise, diet, meditation, and certain acupuncture treatments to help in complete holistic health.  The challenge of finding the right alchemy and balance of it all only fuels my passion while continuing to make small little gains every day… </p>
