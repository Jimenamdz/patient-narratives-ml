UD.

<p>A week ago this past Saturday, on September 30th 2017, my Uncle Dan (my dad’s brother) died from liver cancer.  He was 63.    </p><p>This news came in just a few short days before receiving the news I was in full remission. Certainly an Ebb to the current Flow.  While the end was not surprising, how quickly it came, after official diagnosis in late summer was just another reminder how serious this cancer shit is.  Unfortunately, although he had many symptoms over the last few years, he simply did not get any answers that gave him any chance of beating it until it was far too late.  We are, and always have been the primary champions of our own health.  If something feels off, and continues to, we all need to keep pressing and digging until we have an answer.  There is always an answer.  Many times unfortunately that answer is cancer - but with early detection you give yourself a fighting shot.  Your body gives you signs.  Listen to it.  Ok…  Enough about that…</p><hr><p>My Uncle Danny, (what I called him when I was really young) Uncle Dan (thru the high school years) and UD (a nickname that stuck during the beer fueled young adult years through the end) was quite a remarkable guy.  A forever “bachelor farmer” without any significant other or kids, simply loved the outdoors.  As an avid hunter and fisherman he reaped what he sowed.  Always enjoying the deer or other wild game he bagged - including the sunfish he tricked into taking his bait in one of his hot fishing holes.  Living off the lake and land in his humble abode on Rock Lake just outside McGregor Minnesota.  </p><p>He was one of the first guys I ever knew that started brewing his own beer.  We are talking late 80′s early 90′s.  He had no idea how much of a killing he could have made up here in the Pacific Northwest with his perpetual hoppiest possible brew with the IBU’s and an Alcohol By Volume (ABV) level (if they were to be measured) maximized to match.  Pair that with all of his unforgettable catchphrases (that when he said them, were uniquely UD) from “You Betcha”, “For Sure”, “Think About It”, “F It - Smoke It”, and many, many more - the man was a human branding machine.</p><p>He was a man of extremes.  Either all the way in, or all the way out.  There was no middle ground with UD.  He did what he wanted, and if you didn’t like it, too bad.  This translated both into some of most delicious smoked fish and homemade maple syrup I’ve ever eaten to the some of the most awestruckingly myopic and ignorant political/social belief conversations I have ever been a part of.  That was UD.  Meticulously freezing frame as a freelance photographer on the wing of a hummingbird sipping a sugary solution just outside his window to just not showing up somewhere because he “couldn’t find it” - so simple and complex all at the same time.</p><p>I will forever cherish the times we shared together - from it being the first time I ever played Super Mario Bros. (he was an early original Nintendo adopter - a major bachelor benefit in 1985), listening to his sing along baritone over his favorite Merle Haggard song, getting a metaphorical nose bleed from one of his room clearing farts that were derived from a diet of venison (venny!) and home brews - or just listening to him, while we were both 197 sheets to the wind, laughing until my stomach hurt, tell stories from his past exploits (fishing, hunting, motorcycles, girls, etc.) with a confidence and swagger so off the charts, that it would make Kanye West blush.  What a guy with a style all his own.  He will be really missed.  Certainly gone too soon.  Love you UD.  Rest in peace.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="785" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c8486cfaec7d5816caa9a58973614765/tumblr_inline_oxl7iuAvoM1s56muj_540.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/df0e0f2941eac3fd3df04632d86aa45f/tumblr_inline_ozurzwBZb01s56muj_540.jpg" class="" data-orig-height="785" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c8486cfaec7d5816caa9a58973614765/tumblr_inline_oxl7iuAvoM1s56muj_540.jpg"/></figure><p>- Photo from December 2016.  </p>
