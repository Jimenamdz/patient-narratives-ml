description of radiation process & interesting news regarding chemo --

<p>My first two days of radiation have been good. I’m allowed to plug in my own music while the proton beam machine does its thing, so if anyone wants to make me a playlist, please do! My Spotify username is maggsburgs - just share it with me there. </p><p><br/></p><p>The radiation process is actually super cool. What happens is: I lay on what they call “the couch” which is really just an oblong metal thing that has my specific headrest attached to the end. Then they snap my mask onto the headrest (pictures coming asap!! I promise haha) and thennnnnn they turn on the music I choose and tell me which place in “line” I am for the beam. I’m pretty sure the beam rotates between four different treatment rooms, so I am either first, second, third or fourth in line. If I’m first in line, I don’t have to wait, if I’m second, I wait like 3 minutes, and so on. Once the beam is available for my treatment, they radio into the room I’m in and say “We have the beam, we’ll begin shortly.” Then I hear some weird kind of clicking noises and I know that I am having radiation shot into my head. It’s very strange - sometimes I see flashes of light and sometimes I taste chlorine. Both are just weird things my brain does because it’s being interrupted in a way, if that makes sense. Then, they rotate either me (the “couch” can move both laterally and vertically) or the beam machine (the beam machine is on a huge garage door looking track and can rotate around me, basically) or both, and the process repeats. I am beamed 3x per radiation session. It’s pretty cool! Google proton beam machines because they’re seriously super interesting. I’ll add a picture of one of the rooms that the Mayo treats me in below (as far as I know the treatment rooms are identical).</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="360" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c4a389c9222a0f66683c7523ed4bc5f8/tumblr_inline_oy0r60fpZy1v87hgz_540.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/70fb7686c52a5241e24e16e60d143cfe/tumblr_inline_oy15y61zzd1v87hgz_540.jpg" class="" data-orig-height="360" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c4a389c9222a0f66683c7523ed4bc5f8/tumblr_inline_oy0r60fpZy1v87hgz_540.jpg"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>Chemo news: I previously thought that my treatment plan was as follows: m-f radiation and chemo for 6 weeks, a month break and then six months of straight chemotherapy. </p><p>Yesterday I learned that the plan is a little different than what I had thought. It will be m-f radiation and daily chemo (including weekends) for 6 weeks. Then I get a month break. Then the next six months I do chemo five days a month only, which is such a huge relief. It means I could have a semblance of my old, normal life back. I’m not sure what I’ll do in this regard. I need to talk to my parents about a new plan, now that I’m only going to be sick for a week every month rather than every day for the entire six months. </p><p><br/></p><p>The chemo I’m taking right now is “half strength” and after my month break they will increase my dose with each round. That’s why I’m having such an easy time with my chemo right now. The doctors say that most patients do well the first couple weeks and then treatment starts to catch up with them toward the end of the 6. We’ll see what I can do! I will note that I’ve been extremely tired. </p><p><br/></p><p>People continue to treat me differently than I am used to. I almost feel like the group that treats me normally is shrinking. It’s a bit of a let down, but I do think it’s really cool to find that I can empower myself in such situations. I’ve had like 4 different guys say they don’t want a wife or kids in their lives. It’s strange because no one has ever said this to me in such an unprovoked way, and it’s happened so many times (additionally, it’s not like I’m bringing up marriage or anything haha). I find it a little rude, but It doesn’t really bother me because A) I understand why a person wouldn’t want to build a future with someone who was diagnosed with something so intense at such a young age and B) it’s honestly a good weeding out process. You’d be surprised - having cancer has absolutely crushed my dating life, but in a way it’s also made me so much more prepared to move forward in a realistic, pragmatic way. Which I will admit isn’t the most romantic, but hey, what’s a girl to do. </p><p><br/></p><p>I think I’ve decided that when I am done with cancer treatment I want to do a PhD program in philosophy - I’m thinking ethical theory right now. Who knows. </p><p><br/></p><p>Also - New York / New Jersey was exactly the break I needed. I love my Allie and Allison. Thanks for keeping me sane.  </p><p><br/></p><p>As always - I love you</p>
