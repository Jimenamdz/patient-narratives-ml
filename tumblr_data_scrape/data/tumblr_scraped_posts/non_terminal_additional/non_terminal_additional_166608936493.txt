somewhat interesting

<p>Because of the chemo I’m taking, I have to form a bunch of goofy little habits to keep others from being exposed to the chemo. It’s really good for me but really bad for everyone who doesn’t have my specific diagnosis. </p><p><br/></p><p>1. When I use the bathroom, when I’m done, I have to put the lid down and flush twice to try to get all of the chemicals out of the toilet, lol. </p><p>2. If I have sex, a condom is necessary. Normal for me anyway. </p><p>3. Only I am allowed to touch my chemo medication. If I touch one of my pills directly with my hands that’s fine, but I have to wash them immediately after. If someone else for some reason has to handle my chemo pills, they need to wear gloves and should probably be washing their hands after. </p><p>4. If I sweat a lot in clothes or in bed one night, I have to wash the clothing / sheets separately from other people’s items. Overall a little more safe for me to just wash my stuff separately. </p><p><br/></p><p>The list goes on, this stuff is so weird lol! What a strange little universe I have entered</p>
