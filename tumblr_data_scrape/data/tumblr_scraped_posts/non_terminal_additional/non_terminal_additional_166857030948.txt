not much to update on

<p>I’m still doing pretty well! Still taking lots of naps and such. No other side effects that are altering my life in any significant way. Still doing radiation m-f. Expecting my hair to fall out where they’re beaming me next week or the week after, so when that starts happening i’m just going to buzz it and do the wig thing! Kind of excited about that. Also slightly bummed and nervous, obviously bc it’s so new to me lol. I had a care appointment with someone from my chemo team and she said that she’s never seen hair loss for the chemo I’m on, so I’m happy that hair loss will only be an issue for a little bit. She also told me that 90% of side effects that people typically feel during radiation / chemo time is mostly from the radiation, so I feel like that’s a really good indication that I will be fine when I do my six cycles of chemo post radiation. Ready to get this shit over with. I feel like I’m cruising through this - it’s weird. I expected to feel so much shittier (knock on wood). &mdash; I’ll take what I can get</p><p><br/></p><p>I love you  </p>
