Week 3 of Radiation: hair loss, weed, fatigue, ear stuff?

<p><b><i>Update on symptoms -</i></b><br/></p><p>♡ Frankly, I’m tired all the time. Marijuana helps me in this respect - it gives me energy. Like more than coffee does. It’s the weirdest thing to compare smoking recreationally in Colorado to smoking medicinally here. Someone on one of my teams said that people who use marijuana just tend to do better over the course to treatment, so that was nice to hear. </p><p>♡ I’ve had a few more headaches that are getting minimally worse. Nothing I’m worrying about at this point. </p><p>♡ My hair is starting to fall out in little wisps. It freaked me out when it started (bit of a sobering moment to be staring at a fist full of your hair), but I’m getting a lot more comfortable with it, though and I’m happy that I’m not losing my eyebrows or anything. Figuring out wigs is hard enough, I don’t think I could handle trying to make eyebrows look realistic too lolol. Probably will buzz my head within a week and just switch to wigs and whatnot. It’s strange bc I won’t be completely bald - it’s just where they’re beaming me that I won’t have hair growth. Get prepped for a strange look and a bunch of ballin’ ass wigs (I have 2 so far). </p><p>♡I hear random tones in my ears sometimes. Also not super concerning but something to note. If it becomes a constant thing then it’s a problem. </p><p>✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿✿<br/></p><p>I know I keep saying it over and over but I really am amazed by how many people have been reaching out to me. It’s clear what kind of community I have around me and I couldn’t be more grateful. </p><p>It’s looking like when I move back to the twin cities, Walker and I will hopefully be roommates somewhere in St Paul. VISIT ME!!! everyone plz. </p><p>OH and anyone who has a knack for putting together playlists should make me one to listen to during radiation!! I get to blast whatever music I want. I’m open to lots and lots of music. Just make a playlist on spotify and let me know the name of the playlist &amp; your username</p>
