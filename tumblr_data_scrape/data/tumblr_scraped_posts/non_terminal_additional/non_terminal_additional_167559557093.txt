Close to the end! lots of feels

<p>I realize that my updates have slowed down - sorry about that! Hopefully this post gives you a good idea of where I’m at. </p><p><br/></p><p>I’m in the middle of week 5(of 6)!!!!! When you’re done with radiation, it’s tradition that you ring a bell on the way out of the clinic. I am so excited to ring that damn bell. They did push back my last day because the hospital is closed on Thanksgiving and I need a certain number of radiation sessions. So my last day of radiation is Monday, November 27. Cannot come soon enough. </p><p><br/></p><p>Yesterday was a lot of appointments: I had radiation, a care provider visit, and a social worker follow up. Radiation was fine but I’m very frequently exhausted and I literally fell asleep during radiation so that was a little disorienting (admittedly kind of funny). During my care provider visit we went through my list of medications and coordinated all of that. And then my appointment with the social worker was almost like a therapy session. We talked about the logistics of my future considering the fact that I need a lot of MRIs in the near future. I also learned that most brain patients similar to me only do 5 weeks of radiation SO that was weird to hear. I WISH I ONLY HAD 5 WEEKS. She also told me about this awesome place further north in MN that has polar bears!!! I must go when treatment is over. </p><p><br/></p><p>I’m going to be doing my 6 rounds of chemo (which start 28 days after nov 17) in St Paul, and then I’m going to launch from there when this is over. I might go back to Chicago, or maybe I’ll make a random move and nanny for a year and then go to grad school, or maybe I’ll just go straight to grad school. We’ll see which direction I feel pulled in. I like not knowing! I can’t wait for my life to be unpredictable again. I think that’s what’s been frustrating me recently - I am in such a strict routine and I have so many rules that it kind of lowers the level of spontaneity in my life. I also realize that I’m extremely lucky with how my body is handling this - I don’t feel terrible every day, my chemo is totally fine, I’m just sleepy! I feel that i’m a very lucky cancer patient in that way. I literally haven’t even really lost weight since this all started! Kind of crazy. Also have not thrown up still. All hail Temozolomide. </p><p><br/></p><p>I feel ready to gooooo after maybe a week of sleeping to recover hahaha</p><p><br/></p><p>Love to ALL OF YOU and thank you to my family and friends who have come to visit and spend time with me. It helps me so much to have you around me. Special shouts to allie allison aaron and cory ali megan haddon &amp;jo and obviously my SISTER AND BROTHER MOM AND DAD my fucking home team is the best how did i land with them? Idk &lt;3 </p><p><br/></p><p>Also thank you for just checking in with me via text or call! The constant support from afar is very much appreciated. I love you. </p>
