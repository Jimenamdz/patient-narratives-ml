Yervoy

<p>Yervoy is the new trade name for Ipilimumab, the drug Meagan has been on for her melanoma. She&rsquo;s finished with her course of treatment (it was 4 infusions of about 90 minutes each time, over a 9 week period). She got a scan at the start, one at the 12 week mark (tumors grew, bad sign) and has her final 16 week scan this coming week. <!-- more --></p>

<p>Where do these pharma companies come up with these names? Ipilimumab was hard to pronounce and we heard it pronounced about three different ways. Even our oncologist just called it &ldquo;Ipi&rdquo;. So I get the the need to rename it for their upcoming marketing push. But Yervoy? </p>

<p>How about YerCured? YerGonnaBeAlright? YerOnTheWaytoNoEvidenceOfDisease (or shortened even further - YerNearlyNED)? </p>

<p>What the hell does the &ldquo;voy&rdquo; stand for anyway? YerVoyage is just starting on our expensive treatment? </p>

<p>In our case - we just hope it means it&rsquo;s working.</p>
