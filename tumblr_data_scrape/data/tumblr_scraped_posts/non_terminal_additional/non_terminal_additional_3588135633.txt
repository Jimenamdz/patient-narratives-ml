It's a Long and Winding Road

<p>that leads me to grey hair&hellip;.</p>

<p>The twists and turns continue. Honestly it seems like just when you&rsquo;ve mentally got yourself in order to handle the projected path, something comes and and bam! it all changes.Â <!-- more --></p>

<p>We are learning the difference between FDA approved treatments and clinical trials. In order to participate in a clinical trial, you typically have to have not had treatment for at least 30 days. In some cases you can&rsquo;t have had a certain treatment and in others you can only participate if you&rsquo;ve had certain treatments. I get why this is so - they want to be able to measure the impact of their treatment on the patient and if they are already taking some drug, how will they know which worked?</p>

<p>The thing about approved treatments is a doctor can prescribe them freely. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are under a different treatment regimen up until the minute they put you on the next thing.</p>

<p>The conundrum of course is that you have to be left untreated for a period of time if you want to participate in a clinical trial - which means the disease will progress for sure due to the forced time lag. So that pretty much sucks.</p>

<p>As good as the docs and research nurses are, they don&rsquo;t know it all, and what they think doesn&rsquo;t always turn out right. So they end up toying with your expectations. I think expectation management is pretty important, and right now we have a gap between what we thought would happen and what will likely happen.</p>

<p>Agility and nimbleness need to be the watchwords for a cabana boy.</p>
