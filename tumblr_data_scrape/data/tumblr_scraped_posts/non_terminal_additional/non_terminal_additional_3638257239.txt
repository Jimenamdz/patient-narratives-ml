A Gift

<p>Casey is home for the semester and a gap year and is busy making plans and signing up for classes. His presence is and will be a great source of joy and strength as Meagan becomes disease free, especially through the nasty bits. 

The gift is, this afternoon he said, hey do you want to go down to the art museum? We could and we did. We are fortunate enough to have the time to be able to focus on life and the kids and family and friends and dealing with all aspects of the cancer. And we can do things like this!! </p>
