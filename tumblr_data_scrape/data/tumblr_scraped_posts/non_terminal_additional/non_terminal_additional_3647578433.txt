How Can Calm Days Feel So Strange?

<p>News flash&hellip;nothing happened to day on the cancer front. No new tumors, no scan results, no appointments. Relative calm amongst the troops. Casey and I had a fabulous hike up to Twin Falls (exit 34 off I-90 just past North Bend). We did have a chance to talk about the cancer, and prognosis and pathways - and it was helpful. But mostly an enjoyable day.<!-- more --></p>

<p>So why does an an enjoyable day in some ways make me feel guilty? Because there must be something I could be doing. Alas, not so. We have our game plan for March (stay the course with the anti-hormone drugs). We have scans scheduled for the end of the month. We know the plan for April if there is progression. We have Plans D and E (National Cancer Institute and Cancer Care Alliance clinical trials) for after that. The kids are coping. Meagan looks fabulous and is eating very well. We have a second opinion naturopath visit scheduled for next week with someone who specializes in oncology and the link between conventional and alternative therapy. We&rsquo;ve researched the heck out of treatments and side effect management.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s a good day. But there is that taint in the back of the head. Knowing we face a very difficult challenge. Wanting to be in the moment and live each day fully and with high quality. But it is darn hard! Even at the end of the yoga/tai chi/pilates class I take a couple days a week and they have the warm down mediation, I cannot get the topic out of my head. It&rsquo;s like the cosmic background radiation from the Big Bang - always there and always making a noise. I guess I am not &ldquo;zen&rdquo; enough. I do admire those people who are able to empty their minds and be in and of the moment. It&rsquo;s not me. Probably never will be. </p>

<p>So I get to enjoy these good days - and I genuinely do. But they are not free of the worry and concern. </p>
