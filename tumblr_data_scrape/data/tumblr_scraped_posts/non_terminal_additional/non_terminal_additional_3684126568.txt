So What Do You Do?

<p>A natural conversation starter at parties. But for someone who has left the &ldquo;official&rdquo; workforce, that&rsquo;s a question that sets off a whole range of responses to answers and an unleashing of emotions. Most guys are defined by what they do, not by who they are. So if you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;do&rdquo; anything in a paid sense, as in work for a firm or have some sort of craft or technical skill that enables you to earn a living, the answer you provide can make a big difference in how the evening goes, how you feel about yourself, and how that person relates to you. It also makes a big difference if the asker is male or female.<!-- more --></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a cabana boy, my wife wife has a serious form of cancer and I&rsquo;ve left the workforce to help her overcome this disease&rdquo;. Man: &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s too bad.. Say, I need to go say hello to Jim over there - haven&rsquo;t seen him in ages, will you excuse me?&rdquo;. You just become irrelevant in their eyes. Women&rsquo;s responses are somewhat better, but typically aligned around wanting to know more about the cancer and how Meagan is doing.</p>

<p>Given that it (The Big &ldquo;C&rdquo;) dominates my life right now, it&rsquo;s not like I want to hide it. My letterpress business is still in it&rsquo;s nascent stage (R&amp;D, training, studio set-up) and I don&rsquo;t want characterize myself as a letterpress printer yet. It&rsquo;s definitely on the horizon and I am putting the time into it, so I suppose soon I can express what I do more in those terms and characterize the cabana boy activities as the sideline. But then it seems I am falling back into that trap of defining myself by what I do versus who I am.</p>

<p>So the disappointment, if you can call it that, is that there are few men who will engage in the discussion about what it means to be a cabana boy, and all the feelings and work associated with that, including being empathetic. The women instantly gravitate to Meagan&rsquo;s plight, and wanting to know about treatments and how she is coping. So the message is, being a cabana boy is largely a thankless and anonymous task (except of course for the deep appreciation and acknowledgment of my wife). So one needs to develop a coat of armor and recognize that in a society of strivers and achievers and production, there is just less value attached to caregivers and supporters, especially if you are a guy.Â </p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s why the Cabana Boy Union Local 98105 is an important group for solidarity. Hopefully it stays really small, we really don&rsquo;t want to expand. We want our wives and partners strong and healthy. The meetings are easy to arrange, given there is just one member. There is little disagreement, and getting a quorum is no problem. And we are really good at self-reliance and self-support. The pay is lousy and we don&rsquo;t have much hope for a raise. But the benefits are awesome, as is the work environment. We love our customer. So all in all, I guess the trade-off is worth it - awkwardness at parties and an irrelevance in the eyes of peer males. But happy, appreciative customers and a mission unlike no other.</p>
