<p>Listen to me.<br/>Pain is temporary.<br/>It may last for a minute or an hour or a day or even a year.<br/>But eventually it will subside and something else will take its place.<br/>If I quit however, it will last forever.<br/>You&rsquo;re all spoiled.<br/>Some of you are spoiled.<br/>It&rsquo;s just bottom line, your parents have done everything for you.<br/>You never had to do nothing for yourself.<br/>You&rsquo;re spoiled.<br/>We&rsquo;re gonna keep it real tonight.<br/>Some of you are spoiled brats.<br/>Every time you ever got in trouble, somebody in your house got you out of it.<br/>Every time you&rsquo;ve done something you&rsquo;re not supposed to do, people say, &ldquo;Eric, your mother is a tyrant.&rdquo;<br/>You&rsquo;re right!<br/>She kicked me out.<br/>You&rsquo;re right!<br/>She&rsquo;s mean, but she developed a man.<br/>Because she put me out there and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have to grow up!&rdquo;<br/>And some of you have never learned to grow up.<br/>And so every time something get hard, you quit, you call momma.<br/>I dare you to take a little pain.<br/>I dare you.<br/>I dare you not to go home.<br/>Somebody said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gotta go home, I feel bad.&rdquo;<br/>Go through it.<br/>You are not going to die.<br/>At the end of pain is success.<br/>You&rsquo;re not going to die because you feel a little pain.<br/>I&rsquo;m not eating like I eat at home.<br/>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re about to go to the next level, because if you keep eating like you eat at home,&hellip;<br/>&hellip;you&rsquo;ll keep being a boy or a girl.<br/>It&rsquo;s time to become man, woman.<br/>But I&rsquo;m exactly where I want to be, because I realize I got to commit my very being to this thing.<br/>I gotta breathe it, I gotta eat it, I gotta sleep it.<br/>And until you get there, you&rsquo;ll never be successful in life.<br/>But once you get there, I guarantee you the world is yours.<br/>So, work hard and you can have whatever it is you want.</p>
