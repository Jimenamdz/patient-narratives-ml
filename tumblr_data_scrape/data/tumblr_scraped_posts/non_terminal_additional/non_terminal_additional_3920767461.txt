Expectation management

<p>So we had our naturopath visit on Monday. Meagan received two new supplements to take (which I outlined in an earlier post). One of the treatments discussed was high dose, intravenous delivered Vitamin C. We got a long explanation of the curative powers of Vitamin C and how it affects cancer tumors and cells. When we left, the naturopath was going to email and contact our oncologist to get his buy-in.<!-- more --></p>

<p>That was Monday about 1pm. It&rsquo;s now Thursday, and we&rsquo;ve heard nothing. Nothing from either part of the team. Professionally, wouldn&rsquo;t you think someone would get back to you with either the information about when to come in for treatment, or that our oncologist didn&rsquo;t think it was a good idea, or that they had been unable to connect but would keep trying? Especially after they had been touting the wonders of this particular treatment and setting expectations? And knowing we are likely leaving town right after the scans on the 30th and probably will be instructed to stay off all treatments and supplements until the National Cancer Institute clinical trial she participates in?</p>

<p>The naturopath also made many statements about the alleged efficacy and speed at which the various supplements would work. Not, &ldquo;might work&rdquo;. &ldquo;Would work&rdquo;. How professional or smart is that? Â They aren&rsquo;t the ones who have to deal with the emotional stress and swings if it doesn&rsquo;t work. You&rsquo;d think they would be a bit more circumspect to manage expectations and emotions. Such as, &ldquo;if it works, here&rsquo;s what to expect. If it works here is when you might see results. But it might not work.&rdquo;. At least then you aren&rsquo;t walking out high on a cloud of high expectations only to have them dashed. But they aren&rsquo;t there to deal with the fall-out. That&rsquo;s the cabana boy&rsquo;s job. So next time health care professional - I am going to hold you to a professional standard about expectation management.</p>
