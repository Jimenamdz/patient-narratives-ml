Last Month!

<p>I woke up today and I realized something BIG. I don&rsquo;t know why it didn&rsquo;t hit me before, but it did today in a big jolt. It is my last month of chemotherapy. Wow&hellip;  time really flies by fast when you are having fun. On March 29th I was given the news by my oncologist that I have no more cancerous activity inside of me. You would think that when someone tells you that you have no more cancer, you would go through this insane dramatic moment where you are probably doing the hakuna matata on top of your bed. Instead, the only response my doctor got from me was a very catatonic &ldquo;oh alright.&rdquo; Dont get me wrong, I was and am definitely grateful, but for the longest time I had absolutely no idea how to emotionally feel about this news. Its hard to forget the past six months of my life. Probably 10 of the 14 days I am given in between chemo sessions, I am in bed, too sick and in pain to get out (although my body has gotten stronger with each passing chemo session and 10 has shortened to 7). Probably if I didn&rsquo;t have pictures of me from before cancer I wouldn&rsquo;t have remembered how I looked with hair. Probably I have spent so much time hooked up to an IV machine that the scars from the needles will never completely fade away. In that instant when I was given my remission news, I realized that even if cancer wasn&rsquo;t inside of me anymore, Cancer and I will have a lifelong relationship. But with each passing day the news sinks in more and more and I can finally feel myself nearing towards the end of cancer. Its been really tough but I have gained more perspective of the real world in the past couple of months than I have in my entire life. If I could give one advice to anyone touched by cancer, its be patient and take it one day at a time. And DONT loose faith&hellip;<strong>ever</strong>. </p>
<p>On a seperate note I know I haven&rsquo;t written a cancer post for quiet a long time. I promised myself I would document this phase of my life and write for myself and for others. I did a terrible job at that, but I will still be updating this blog with cancer posts just many of them might be in the past tense&hellip;</p>
