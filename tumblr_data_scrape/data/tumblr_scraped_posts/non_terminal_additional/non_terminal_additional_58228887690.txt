Cancer Chronicles (Poem)

<p>Dirty looks, constant stares, and even whispering behind my back. This is something normal for someone like me. Constant questions like &ldquo;oh my god what happened?&rdquo; or oh my God why do you have to wear that mask?&ldquo; Or here&rsquo;s my favorite &quot;oh my god what happened to your hair?&rdquo; You wonder what I tell them in reply? I simply say; I am a 21 year old woman that God so happened to give a battle that he knew I could handle. I may not understand why God would give one of his precious children something so turmoil to go through but He did. Yes I may have no immune system and yes I may not have any hair and yes I get poison pumped into my body every other week but STILL I RISE, I am still BLESSED because there are far more people worse than me in the same situation. Yes I do have my bad days but when I think about me not having to be in the hospital for months I smile. Yeah I may have cancer but that is not stopping me in being me. Don&rsquo;t you dare have pitty for me cause See how I see it that this is only a test for my testimony. I will defeat cancer and I will be a survivor.</p>
