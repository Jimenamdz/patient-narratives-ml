Devastated

<p>I am at the doctor,  and my weight was 395.8  That is only 3 lbs less than two weeks ago.   I thought I had done everything right.   I’m only a month out from surgery.   It feels too soon to hit a wall.   I have exercised 5 days a week,  and eaten between 600 and 800 calories every day.   Why is this not working?   I am afraid I am never gonna make it now.   Does anyone know how I can get it back on track? </p>
