<p dir="ltr">The nurse updated my medication, and I had to spell Tamoxifen and Herceptin for her. There is a certain type of shitty that a cancer patient gets when dealing with non-oncology staff for the first time in a year. I’ve been spoiled. She got ready to do my blood pressure, and if she had gone for my bad arm, I probably would have choked her with her stethoscope. </p>
