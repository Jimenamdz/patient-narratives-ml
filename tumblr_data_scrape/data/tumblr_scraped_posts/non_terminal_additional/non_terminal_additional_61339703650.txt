Back on Board

<p>My pity party is over.   Thanks everyone for the encouragement.   I started logging my water,  and realized I am way under my daily goal.   My doctor upped my protein intake from 60 grams to 85 grams.   I have no idea how I am supposed to get that much in.   I increased my running time to a minute and thirty seconds today.   I&rsquo;m working through this plateau! </p>
