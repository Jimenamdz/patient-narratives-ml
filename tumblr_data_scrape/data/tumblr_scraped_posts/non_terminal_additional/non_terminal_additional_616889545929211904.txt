I bought wigs. I relied on eyelash extensions so I could feel normal. I cut my hair short so it didn’t look like I had a mullet. I airbrushed my skin a few times just so I could have pretty arms and legs until I took a shower. I lived in hoodies because of how forgiving they are, no matter what weight my body wanted to be at that week. I watched my money go $500 at a time. I discovered chemotherapy was a heartless, but logical bitch. I couldn’t make myself feel beautiful, no matter how hard I tried - I felt ran over and thought I looked dehydrated and used up. I didn’t want to do it. I wanted it over with. </p><p><br/></p><p>But I fucking did it. </p><p><br/></p><p>I am STILL recovering from it all. It’s hard to see pictures of yourself before and see how much a thing like cancer took from you. A bastard like cancer. People will tell you “you are so beautiful”, but it’s a process. To have long hair again? That would be the dream. To know for a fact that I’ll never have to go through it again? That would be the dream. </p><p>To have a place on my own, despite the medical bills and the setback it put me at? That would be the dream. A damn dream. A dream I thought that would never happen many times while I took those godawful pills. </p><p>But here we are. A new place. I can breathe here. I can decorate how I want to and look at every single piece that’s in my house and smile, saying “heh - remember when you thought the only room you’d get at one point was a hospital bed? Look.” Yes, the fear of cancer coming back is always in the back of my mind. But right now&hellip; I can breathe here. </p><p>I am proud of myself. If anybody is the most supportive and proud of myself&hellip; it’s me. I’ve always got me, I can be self-efficient. In the words of Lizzo and her song Soulmate, “I&rsquo;m my own soulmate. I know that I’m always gonna hold me down.” And that’s been proven time and time again. I’ve been told by a man that I would never have my own, that I was worthless. And he beat the shit out of me. And I had cancer tell me the same, also suffocating me. But I have proved those words to be false, even if my brain might want to say otherwise sometimes. I just want to look them both in the eye one day and say&hellip;</p><p><br/></p><p>“But I fucking did it.”</p><p><br/></p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2048" data-orig-width="1152"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s640x960/5511a192f66dbcc1a2b8f3def58a5e26fb049a04.jpg" data-orig-height="2048" data-orig-width="1152" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s75x75_c1/d0797872104e82f78a80e437f06f88187e4f005c.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s100x200/43b22b3febca207ca13cad6128cfc268e6f86c85.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s250x400/8c8cdc3cbfcb006e683384b2941567f380414283.jpg 225w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s400x600/1147be5173a00a160a9e7f5fdee38d53fcfa542c.jpg 338w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s500x750/3c20ba39d590ad80e74c2f774badbdbe7ba2250a.jpg 422w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s540x810/4ba016081e42d33e545d6ec7badd98d79346c1e6.jpg 456w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s640x960/5511a192f66dbcc1a2b8f3def58a5e26fb049a04.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s1280x1920/e2c7518530e1f3097582d72dab39b888397c2fad.jpg 1080w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/c2dae9ca898d6b718dc3198fa522e46e/f92bd6a842c0d79f-0d/s2048x3072/c0dfe53c1ca91b514c34d2aee9de09ce71279bdf.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"/></figure></div>
