Looking for Non Scale Victories

<p>For the 3rd week in a row, I have lost approximately 1 lb.  Week after week, my doctor, nutritionist, and personal trainer have assured me that I am doing everything right and need to wait a little longer for my body to adjust to my new lifestyle.  If it takes any longer, I am going to scream!  I am going to try and start looking for non scale victories to keep me going.  Everyone tells me I’ve lost inches, but I have never measured myself before.  This is mostly due to the fact that I larger than most measuring tape, and it is highly embarrassing to stand there with a big gap at your hips when the tape ends won’t meet.  Today my trainer did measure me so I can look at it the next time the scale disappoints me.  Here is goes.</p>
<p>Neck: 16 inches</p>
<p>Bicep: 23 inches</p>
<p>Forearm: 15 inches</p>
<p>Chest 58 inches</p>
<p>Smallest waist (under my boobs): 53 inches</p>
<p>Natural waist: 60 inches</p>
<p>Hip: 69 inches</p>
<p>Thigh:33 inches</p>
<p>Calf:24 inches</p>
<p>Cankle: 15 inches</p>
<p>Total: 366 inches</p>
<p>I did have a small victory this morning.  This nutritionist wanted me to eat some peanut butter with a banana before I did my heavy duty workout with my trainer.  I tried it, but the peanut was so sweet I couldn’t eat it.  It was seriously gross to me.  As a girl who loves her sweets, this is definitely an accomplishment in changing my eating patterns.  I was a little proud of myself.</p>
