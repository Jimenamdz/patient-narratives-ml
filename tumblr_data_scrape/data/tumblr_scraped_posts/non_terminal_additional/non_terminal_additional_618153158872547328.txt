I’m healing right now.

<p>“There are many &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; (that&rsquo;s my way of being nice lol) on what should be done once you leave a relationship&hellip;</p><p>&hellip;.get over somebody by getting under somebody new 🙄</p><p>&hellip;.get revenge 🙄</p><p>&hellip;.get back with an ex because you&rsquo;re lonely 🙄</p><p>NOTHING will erase the hurt, pain or memories!</p><p>Rather it was your fault, his fault, yall fault.. </p><p>You should do this before doing ANYTHING else.</p><p><br/></p><p>HEAL.</p><p><br/></p><p>Why?</p><p>Because, the last thing you want to do is get into another relationship with emotional baggage just to kill what could&rsquo;ve been a great love if you were in the right mindset and emotional stance.”</p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-tumblr-attribution="pam-beesly-jim-halpert:3ZGs6QrEULaO0Fejkv5TMQ:Zn5-fg2P3Kh9h" data-orig-height="176" data-orig-width="400"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/96f3b1ac1a3af4c31b19b03ea92adda8/ca2ec3d4333501a4-28/s640x960/0737db6e7fe65be16ce83c5c242b52d1086d7c4e.gif" data-orig-height="176" data-orig-width="400" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/96f3b1ac1a3af4c31b19b03ea92adda8/ca2ec3d4333501a4-28/s75x75_c1/c1977b1b164759f281fca81628ef0afed055bdf5.gif 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/96f3b1ac1a3af4c31b19b03ea92adda8/ca2ec3d4333501a4-28/s100x200/8be5c7f3a4c1758bfe8dea433033d1d8a86da5e9.gif 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/96f3b1ac1a3af4c31b19b03ea92adda8/ca2ec3d4333501a4-28/s250x400/9c9b2b30694a6a2115cc73929302d8da0188e8ff.gif 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/96f3b1ac1a3af4c31b19b03ea92adda8/ca2ec3d4333501a4-28/s400x600/be124c693cf5f9f756c93eb6c35f226bf2869c45.gif 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"/></figure></div><p>I read this quote today while scrolling through Facebook. </p><p>I’ve always been the girl to jump in a relationship after relationship. I’ve always kinda sought after someone else to validate me, make me feel important, and felt like a strong connection needed to be chased. But is it healthy and will it benefit me and my mental health in the long run? Hell no. </p><p>So I’m doing things different this time. I’m fixing myself where I’ll be able to give someone 100% again, not a mere 75%. </p><p>I’m letting myself heal from a recent relationship where we talked about living together, getting a dog together, and someone I truly loved. I’m not going to move on as if it never existed and bury it so it can come back later.</p><p>Instead, I am healing. I am not jumping back into another relationship right away (because that’s completely not healthy in my eyes). I am not going to go to the next so easily and bring my doubts, my trust issues I now have thanks to my last relationship and the one prior, and hinder a relationship that could be something great - just because I’m not 100% yet. Instead, if I am lonely&hellip; I am going to sit in my loneliness. I’m going to discover why I feel that way and I’m going to work on myself so I don’t get in another relationship just because I feel like I need one. </p><p>Respect means a lot to me. And whoever I choose to bring in my life next, I want to show that same respect I ask for from them by being in the best place for another relationship. It wouldn’t be fair to the next person if I only gave half of me. It’ll be some time. </p><h2>I’m healing right now. </h2>
