12 Life-Impacting Symptoms Complex PTSD Survivors Endure

<p>I love my Psychiatrist. </p><p>Recently, I’ve had the help I’ve needed and I’ve been officially diagnosed with C-PTSD or Complex PTSD. </p><p>I saw a counselor when I first went through my abuse, but I also withheld a lot of information and a lot of things that happened to me when I was that young with my abusive ex. To this day, I still get nightmares. </p><p>Recently, I’ve noticed I hold onto relationships a lot tighter these days. Doesn’t help that the most recent ones I’ve had, both have cheated on me. Because of that detail, it brought triggers to me that I thought were not a thing anymore. I thought I was okay, minus the nightmares and always being on guard (something I actually prided myself on more than was worried about). </p><p>Divorce is something nobody will ever understand, if they haven’t been through it themselves. It makes you feel incompetent and disposable, even when you know you’re far from it - she’s a sneaky bitch. Being divorced is one thing, but being divorced at 20 years old, a few months until you’re 21st birthday? To a man who tried to kill you SO many times? Add all of the pain from a divorce itself and sprinkle constantly watching your back, suicidal thoughts because you’re just over being essentially hunted, feeling detached from yourself, and nightmares that feel very, very real. </p><p>I’m proud of myself for accessing my broken parts and fixing them. Before adding someone else to the mix and breaking their heart (because that is exactly what I’ll do if I’m not okay). I’ve got to fix me first. I was okay a few months ago, until I got paranoid in my relationship. I noticed him hiding his phone, going to the bathroom for a long time with his phone, and a lot more similar behaviors. When all things were proven, it just went downhill for me from there. In some sense, I’m glad it happened because I’m able to see something else I can work on to be my best self (something I’m all about and constantly trying to do). But in the other sense, it triggered me completely for reasons.</p><p>So here we are today ❤️ it’s not a bad thing to seek help. I know now I am well on the path to be the best version of me I can be. And to not let my past win and bleed over into my next relationships. I’ve done a lot of self-reflecting, facing demons and uncovering memories I’ve buried, and have been able to find a problem so I can now focus on my solution. </p><p>Please get help if you are struggling. </p><p class="npf_link" data-npf='{"type":"link","url":"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fthemighty.com%2F2017%2F08%2Flife-impacting-symptoms-of-complex-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd%2F&amp;t=MzcwODg4MDE2ZmFhOGM4YWY4NGI5YzhlNzY5OGMyY2MyOWY0YWVkNCxlZGI5NzQ2ZmE1ZTdjMzQ4MTIzNWIwNjMwZmNjNzU2NjU3ZGI5MWZm","display_url":"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fthemighty.com%2F2017%2F08%2Flife-impacting-symptoms-of-complex-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd%2F&amp;t=MzcwODg4MDE2ZmFhOGM4YWY4NGI5YzhlNzY5OGMyY2MyOWY0YWVkNCxlZGI5NzQ2ZmE1ZTdjMzQ4MTIzNWIwNjMwZmNjNzU2NjU3ZGI5MWZm","title":"12 Life-Impacting Symptoms Complex PTSD Survivors Endure","description":"\"All of these issues are very normal for complex trauma survivors.\"","site_name":"The Mighty","poster":[{"media_key":"be53164549142da4e181999263452e95:13a5b9197b6d6639-a4","type":"image/jpeg","width":2121,"height":1060}]}'><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fthemighty.com%2F2017%2F08%2Flife-impacting-symptoms-of-complex-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd%2F&amp;t=MzcwODg4MDE2ZmFhOGM4YWY4NGI5YzhlNzY5OGMyY2MyOWY0YWVkNCxlZGI5NzQ2ZmE1ZTdjMzQ4MTIzNWIwNjMwZmNjNzU2NjU3ZGI5MWZm" target="_blank">12 Life-Impacting Symptoms Complex PTSD Survivors Endure</a></p>
