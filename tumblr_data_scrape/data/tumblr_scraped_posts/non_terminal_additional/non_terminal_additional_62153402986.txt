<p dir="ltr">I&rsquo;m not just the girl who lost two tits to cancer. I&rsquo;m also a mother who breastfed her two children for a total of 36 months. I can&rsquo;t begin to explain the joy and fulfillment I felt nursing my children. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Throughout this diagnosis and treatment, I&rsquo;ve discovered things for which to be grateful. One thing is that I was able to have and raise my babies before I was without my breasts. And now I have an opportunity to show other women the incredible privilege it is to nourish and nurture your child with your own body. Starting next month I have a new, additional part time job; Breastfeeding Peer Counselor for our county. </p>
