Scale Inconsistency

<p>The scale at my oncologist always weighs me exactly 2 lbs heavier than the scale at my gym or other places.  It is so frustrating.  I was celebrating a weight loss victory at the gym yesterday morning to have it ripped away from me an hour later at the oncologist.  I never know which scale is correct.  </p>
<p>In other doctor related news, my kidney function shows I am not drinking enough water.  I feel like all I do is drink water, but I still can&rsquo;t enough in.  I have tried crystal light, putting fruit in it, and using fancy water bottles.  I like water; my stomach just doesn&rsquo;t have enough space for all the water I am supposed to drink.  Should I go back to all liquid until I can get enough in?  I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
