Walking Pneumonia

<p>Of course I get as sick as soon as I get used to this running thing.  I think it is because it is so cold in the mornings when I go.  The doctor said I can&rsquo;t run or go to the gym for at least a week.  It has been 4 days so far.  Why am I eating everything in sight?  I have had horrible cravings, and I have eaten more calories the last four days then I have since before surgery.  Shouldn&rsquo;t I be less hungry without exercise?  Maybe it is because I am stuck in the house and have that boredom hunger.  My salt intake has been insane from soups and powerade zero.  I am worried about getting on the scale at the end of the week to see what has happened after all this eating and not exercising.  I have an appointment with my personal trainer on Friday, and we will see then.  Actually, the night before I will be eating at a restaurant for my husband&rsquo;s 30th birthday, so I am really really nervous about that too.  Can I please be better by then?</p>
