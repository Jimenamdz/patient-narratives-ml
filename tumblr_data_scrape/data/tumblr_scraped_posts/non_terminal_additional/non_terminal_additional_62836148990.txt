October Goal

<p>My goal for October is to meet my fluid goal EVERY SINGLE DAY.  I have probably met it a handful of times since my surgery, so I stay constantly dehydrated.  It is bad for my kidneys and bad for my health.  I have legitimately tried, but I need to try harder.  I will do this all month long.  If I can do it for 31 days, then I can do it for the rest of my life.</p>
