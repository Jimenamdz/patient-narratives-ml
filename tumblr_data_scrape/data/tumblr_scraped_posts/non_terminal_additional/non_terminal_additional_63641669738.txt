The first 100 lbs down!

<p>HURRAY!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>The scale said 379.8 lbs this morning.  That is 100 lbs less than my highest ever recorded weight of 480.  It is only 50 lbs since surgery, but I am still super proud of myself.  My old jeans from college finally fit me again, and I feel like I may never take them off.  There have been so many positive changes in my life since I have taken on this journey.  I can breathe easily, walk up stairs, stand around (for more than 2 minutes), walk around the mall or the grocery store without needing a break, and much much more.  I am trying to remember all of these small victories so I don&rsquo;t take for granted my mobility and all the little things I could never do before because of my weight.  I want to remember this moment to help push me through the next 100 lbs, and the 100 lbs after that.  I am not even close to almost there, but I am on my way baby!</p>
