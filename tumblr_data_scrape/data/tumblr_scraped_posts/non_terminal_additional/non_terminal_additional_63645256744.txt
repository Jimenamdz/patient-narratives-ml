Now I'm grumpy.

<p>When I first hit my stall, I was really positive about it, assuming my body would get its act together soon with enough protein and water and exercise. <br/> Today I’m grumpy.<br/> I feel really defeated. 30lbs is all my body is capable of shedding? It refuses to work with me. <br/> I’m not whining. I’m pissed.</p>
<p>GRUMPY</p>

<p>KEEP GOING!  I just hit my first stall too.  It took WEEKS longer than I thought, and I was afraid the surgery was for nothing.  2 weeks out from surgery, I lost 30 lbs.  The next few weeks, I could only manage a single lousy lb a week.  6 weeks later, I am down another 20 lbs.  I jumped on the scale one day, expecting another single digit loss and I had lost like 5 lbs.  It DOES work.  Keep doing all the right things, and your body will jump on board.  It just doesn&rsquo;t do it on your timetable (or mine, LOL).</p>
