<p>I just had a thought</p><p>Fred and George would&rsquo;ve been really good at Potions. Just from observing what they stocked their shop with, including a passable amortentia, they must&rsquo;ve been <i>really</i> good. And it would&rsquo;ve <b>driven Snape insane.</b> </p><p>I mean think about it. Here&rsquo;s two kids who don&rsquo;t care about lessons enough to pay attention but somehow ace tests. Weren&rsquo;t listening to the monologue about bezours but can answer his pointed question without missing a beat. Don&rsquo;t even sit the exams but then go on to <b>open a successful shop selling various bewitched objects and <i>potions.</i></b></p><p>Maybe their greatest most elaborate prank. Convincing everyone including Snape they were not academics. While <b>playing the long game</b> and becoming successful fueled entirely on spite.</p><p>Now tell me they shouldn&rsquo;t have been slytherin.</p>
