I want to pay some gay-coded little man to creep around my house saying ominous things and smirking to himself and punctuating every sentence with an evil little laugh while I pretend to be totally oblivious. And of course I ignore his evil advice, but I always have an excuse as to why, and he unconvincingly pretends to be
okay with it, but later that night I hear him
having an absolute meltdown in his room until he comes up with a new evil plan and bursts into a musical number that
ends with maniacal laughter which continues for about 10 minutes<br/></p></blockquote>
