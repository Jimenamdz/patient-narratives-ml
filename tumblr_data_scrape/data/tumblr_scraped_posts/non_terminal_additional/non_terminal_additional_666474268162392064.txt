<p>Story time: I’m a trans guy. I have an identical twin. <br/><br/>We’re both tall, androgynous, and have naturally deep voices</p>
<p>In high school a rumor was spread that one of us was trans. For years, everyone in school had convinced themselves that my twin was “the trans one”. She rolled with it to keep me safe, and said it felt like a compliment to be mistaken for a trans woman since she looked up to a lot of trans women. That didn’t stop the bullying, but it’s easier to deal with when it’s directed at the wrong person.<br/><br/>I’m engaged to a feminine cis guy who is several inches shorter than me. I have 20-30lbs on him and I can dead lift him. He’s more delicate and soft both physically and socially. He cries during sad movies, owns half a million stuffed animals, and clings to my arm when he’s nervous or it’s cold out (oh yeah, also he’s adorable)<br/><br/>Whenever the topic of being trans comes up, cis people tend to think <i>he’s</i> the one who is trans. Direct all “what do your parents think?” comments onto him. <i>Completely</i> ignore me. Ask him invasive/transphobic questions about his body. Tell him “you pass so well!” through grit teeth. Like with my sister, I get pretty pissed about this, but there’s not much I can do about it.<br/><br/>I have had to <b>argue</b> with cis people to establish the fact I’m trans because they don’t believe me &amp; think I’m joking. they’re like “but he’s - no, she’s trans!” and frantically point fingers at my fiance and sister. Because there’s no way an adult cis woman could be taller than 5′9 and choose to be bare-faced, and an adult cis man could love <i>How To Train Your Dragon 2 </i>with a fiery passion, enough to watch it 3 times in the theatre. <br/><br/>Terfs take one look at us and try to convince my sister she’ll never have a uterus or that she’s “appropriating women’s spaces”. Transphobes say my boyfriend will “always be a girl” and call him gendered slurs. They talk over them, block them, and grill them about what genitalia they have online. Completely unknowing that they’re talking to two cisgender people who are gay and gnc.<br/><br/>@ <b>young, closeted, scared trans people</b>: any cis person who insists they can somehow “know” your “birth sex” by looking at you because “it’s so obvious!” is full of shit. people come in all shapes and sizes regardless of gender. Not only are they being transphobic, but they’re being homophobic too.</p>

<p>i tend to fret about how well i pass as male and then i remember that on multiple occasions i’ve told cis dudes i’m trans and they assumed i was *on my way* to becoming a woman, and i had to explain that i’d already been one but quit. </p></blockquote>
