I wore a 44H cup from Lane Bryant&hellip; NOTHING got me flat. Not a single thing made me look less than a DD. That&rsquo;s because I had 13 pounds of tissue on my rib cage that can&rsquo;t compress INTO that rib cage no matter how tight I pulled things. No folding, no layering, no doubling up <b>ever</b> was enough for my bf to even notice the size difference. I spent hundreds trying and every time I would be left sobbing in front of the mirror in garbage that left me suffocated and bulging. </p><p>THIS HAPPENS&hellip; Not everyone has a success story with binding, and I wish I wish that I had found just one person that had said&hellip; <b>Hey, it&rsquo;s never going to work at that size but that&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s not your fault.</b></p><p> It&rsquo;s not because you didn&rsquo;t research. Because you didn&rsquo;t TRY hard enough. Sometimes bodies just don&rsquo;t compress. They aren&rsquo;t meant to. </p><p>So&hellip; it sucks but you&rsquo;re not alone. </p></blockquote>
<p>I was there&hellip; a 42 H. I felt so relieved when I got them removed. </p>
