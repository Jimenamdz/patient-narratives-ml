Maybe There Should Be an Introduction:

<p>Do blogs require introductions when you plan on keeping yourself mostly anonymous? Which parts of me am I planning to hide and which shall I be parading around like a peacock? Maybe time will just have to tell.</p><p>For now, my intentions for this space are to process my inner thoughts&hellip; inner thoughts that have, for (almost) 23 years drifted around in circles, interrupting my life aimlessly. I don’t even mean that in a negative way. The truth is we all have this presence in our heads that enjoys reviewing how we’ve performed in a day. I just want to share how mine works and see if anyone else connects.</p><p>Mainly, I want to share my journey of all the selfs - self-realisation, self-reflection, self-care &amp; of course, self-love. </p>
