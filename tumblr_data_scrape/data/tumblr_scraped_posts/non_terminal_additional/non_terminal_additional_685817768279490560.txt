Forward ho! Radiation treatment for rectal cancer begins

<h1>Forward ho! Radiation treatment for rectal cancer begins</h1><p>First radiation treatment; didn&rsquo;t feel a thing. 10 minutes in and out.</p><p>Haven&rsquo;t started the chemo pills yet because they won&rsquo;t get here until Friday. They have to be delivered by some special service. Pharmacies aren&rsquo;t allowed to handle them because they&rsquo;re that toxic. The oncology nurse said no one but me should touch them. Guess I&rsquo;m already compromised.</p><p>She also said I might need to take up to 3 sits baths a day. WTF is that I wondered, but kept it to myself. Don&rsquo;t most people sit in baths?.?<br/><br/>Turns out it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-take-a-sitz-bath-1944927">&ldquo;Sitz&rdquo; baths</a>. It comes from the German word for seat. Very creative.<br/><br/>No more wiping. I&rsquo;m allowed to pat. And they gave me a squirt bottle to keep my butt clean. Upon hearing this my friend Jason ordered me a <a href="https://hellotushy.com/">Tushy</a>.<br/><br/><i>We can do hard things.</i></p><p>I asked if I could use the pool this summer. &ldquo;As long as you have no open wounds,&rdquo; I was told. <br/><br/>Open. Wounds. OPEN. WOUNDS.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be honest with you,&rdquo; the radiology nurse said lowering her glasses on her nose and leaning in, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t going to be easy. Stay on top of your skin care.&rdquo;</p><p>Right. Hoo.</p>
