The SURPASS_4 trial demonstrated that in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk tirzepatide compared to insulin glargine markedly reduces Hba1c and body weight. About 1 out of 3 patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease has kidney disease and these patients are at high risk of kidney failure. The aim of this study was to assess whether tirzepatide could slow CKD progression in high risk individuals with type 2 diabetes participating in the SURPASS 4 trial.<i> </i><br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com:  What are the main findings?</i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b><i>  </i>The main findings were that tirzepatide indeed significantly reduced albuminuria (a strong renal and cardiovascular risk marker), reduced eGFR decline compared to insulin glargine and reduced the risk of a composite kidney endpoint of new-onset macroalbuminuria, 40% eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease and renal death. These data suggest that tirzepatide may confer kidney protection and support future trials to provide more definitive evidence.<i> </i><br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report?</i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> The main message from this study is that a novel GIP-GLP-1RA does not only reduce HbA1c and body weight but also slows the decline in kidney function in high risk patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease. Readers should realize that these data are generated as part of an exploratory analysis and can not yet be interpreted as definitive evidence but they support additional research to confirm the kidney protective effects of tirzepatide.<br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work?</i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> A large dedicated renal outcome trial should be conducted<br/><br/><i>My disclosures are that I am a consultant to Eli-Lilly</i><br/><br/>Citation:<br/><br/><i>American Diabetes Associations 2022 Meeting</i><br/><br/>Source Reference: <a rel="noopener" href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/71/Supplement_1/17-OR/145244/17-OR-ADA-Presidents-Select-Abstract-Effects-of" data-sce-target="_blank"><i>Heerspink HL, et al &ldquo;Effects of tirzepatide vs. insulin glargine 100 U/mL on kidney outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes in SURPASS-4&rdquo; ADA 2022; Abstract 17-OR.</i></a><br/><br/><i>The information on MedicalResearch.com is provided for educational purposes only, and is in no way intended to diagnose, cure, or treat any medical or other condition.
