Soggy From The Chemo (a sick/angstfic)

<h1>Soggy From The Chemo (a sick/angstfic)</h1><p>TW for cancer descriptions as well as chemo and addiction. I tried my best to depict it as realistically as possible, but lemme know if there’s anything I need to change in the future. I wanted to get a better idea of what I’m going to be putting my boy Elijah through in this novel of his and the start of the fic had been sitting there for a while, so I decided to finish it. I hope you enjoy if you decide to read!</p><p>An overwhelming sense of heaviness sat unabatingly across Elijah, as he sat half-laying on the leather seat which made up a part of the ring circling the entirety of the sterily formulaic chemo room. It was a feeling he had become accustomed to in the month which had dispersed since his life had ended. To the vision of hourglass grains, it may appear to have been just another gentle upheavel of a day, but to Elijah&rsquo;s unilateral vision, another reality was conjured. No more was Wednesday merely a day, or a headache merely an inconvenience; now each Wednesday burnt his veins with sickened throes of dread from diagnosis association, and each headache faded blindly into the next, and left him in a constant state of turbulent vibration and bone nausea. Eating was a chore, sleeping was a dream, and living had effectively halted. He had tried to continue working, but all he was able to manage was three days a week on a<i> really </i>good week, so that left leagues of time spent of him wasting away in his flat, trying desperately to maintain some sense of normality. This came in the form of him throwing himself into his painting and drawing, anything to keep his brain off of the topic of itself, of the cancer which festered within itself.</p><p>He had stage 3 small-cell carcinoma with brain mets. The newly formed brain tumour which had incited the need for a diagnosis had only been an extant result of a bigger problem he had never paid attention to while it had slowly developed within him. It was one of the biggest cancer killers for veterans, and it looked like it had gotten ahold of yet another. Who even knew how much dirt, shrapnel, chemicals, bone-fragments and active war-zone inhalants he had drawn into his lungs during his deployments, or how many cigarettes he had smoked through to keep his hands from shaking from the memory of it? He always chalked every one of his early symptoms to the smoking, it made sense for his chest to hurt and for him to be set off coughing at random, right? For his lungs to produce acidic rust and for him to have to sometimes fight for breath? Surely, he was just losing weight due to the stress and the trauma. </p><p>Like the fucking idiot he was, he had ignored everything until his condition had advanced to the point it had metastasised elsewhere so that he could no longer ignore it. It demanded his undivided attention, and boy fucking shit did it have it now.</p><p>A constant physical sense of dread weighed down upon him now, never having let up since first hearing Michelle gasp out that word through her tears, and certainly remaining steadfast atop him now, as the amber chemo syrup slowly dripped into his veins from the IV in the top of his hand, knowing deep in his aching bones that he would be completely laid low once he got home that night, as if he ever wasn’t low these days.</p><p>Perhaps he had thought that each infusion would become easier because he would have a better idea of what to expect each time, but that had turned out to be a total sham – every single session he was left feeling worse than the last, and could expect to be glued to the couch, his bed, or the bathroom floor for at least the first four days afterwards. He had begrudgingly taken up knitting to craft himself some personalised beanies to hide his barely peach fuzz-covered head, and his mouth was a constant bleeding mess of sores he still couldn’t work out how to combat. His complexion had seemed to permanently lighten from the gorgeous deep brown it usually was, perpetually washed out in appearance with a face once nicely toned left puffy and swollen. Everything he tried to put in his mouth was coppery in taste and never wanted to stay. His clothes, which were now practically always heavy and wintery-intended, constantly became heavier and grossly damp from the treatment-induced sweats, and he trembled with a fever he could never seem to break. His chest and head constantly hurt to the point of tears and sometimes blacking out, and he had a total of six more grand-mal seizures since his first. His mind seemed to have come to a complete stand-still, so foggy he could barely speak at times, and when he did it sounded as if his voice was totally alien to him, as if someone else entirely was steering his ship. They hadn’t passed their aptitude test, however, and they steered him into walls and sent him to the ground it seemed every time he tried to walk, to the point Michelle, who had become his biggest support system and makeshift caretaker, had suggested they look into a wheelchair for him. This wasn’t a big deal for her, she already used one spasmodically for her MS when it got particularly burdensome, but Elijah was extremely unimpressed with that idea – he hadn’t even needed one when he had returned home disfigured from war, why would he suddenly start using one now? That was an ongoing fight between them, but aside from that Michelle was entirely in his corner, taking him to appointments, getting his groceries, caring for him where no one else could. He knew his family so wanted to be with him in this, but by this point they had scattered, all the children now independent, and many had ended up returning to Italy. Two of his siblings, Bella and Mattia, still remained in the country, but they were nowhere near him, it would be an insurmountable task trying to get to him, and it wasn’t something he could expect them to do. He didn’t have any friends outside of work he could actually trust.</p><p>Michelle really was the only one he had, and he couldn’t be more grateful for that.</p><p>He nervously sucked on what was so lovingly called a ‘cancer pop’, a warm-tasting turmeric and cinnamon popsicle he was always given every infusion, and despite it hitting his stomach awkwardly and making it twist in protest, it was like practical heaven on his sore-infested mouth. He had managed to down a warm, almost sickeningly sweet tea and a few digestives since sitting down, as the staff insisted he eat as much as he could during the sessions (probably due in part to the fact they knew he found it so hard to do so while at home), and while the actual chemo hadn’t started making him feel sick just yet, you weren’t exactly given a lot of time to recover between infusions – he was still fighting off the last dose. Plus every time he didn’t spit out the bloody mucous he produced regardless of whether he had been coughing or not, it just got swallowed and went straight to his stomach. Swallowing a concoction like that would make anyone green around the gills, not to even mention he did it multiple times a day. </p><p>As he ate his popsicle he found he stopped breathing while performing the sucking motion, and thus when he would eventually stop and swallow what he had worked off the stick he would have to fight to regain some of the oxygen he had missed, which with his cancer-riddled lungs was an extremely hard undertaking. He got out of breath so easily, merely sitting still and not moving at all, just doing nothing but breathing, he would get winded, tiring out just by the mere effort of pulling air in and pushing it back out. They were currently in the middle of assessing whether he needed supplementary oxygen, but apparently he didn’t quite meet the threshold just yet. Elijah couldn’t help but be stuck on the distinction, <i>yet</i>. How encouraging. You’re fine <i>for now</i>. But how long would that last? He had unknowingly left his cancer simmering within him for quite some time, what seemed like a drastic and rapid outcome had in actuality been a long time coming. He hadn’t just woken up one day with stage 3 cancer – it had once been a vague tickle in his chest, probably a year ago, where he had just chalked it up to smoking a bit too much. Well, he hadn’t technically been wrong.</p><p>Because this wasn’t the paediatric oncology unit and he and Michelle weren’t married or in that kind of relationship, it was encouraged that she didn’t accompany him to the sessions, where he and everyone else there were severely immunocompromised and were already putting themselves at risk just by being there to get their medicine. Michelle entering the hospital unnecessarily would up the risk of either carrying or coming down with all the various illnesses they generally tried to keep away from the cancer patients, which would in turn put Elijah at great risk of getting sick, and with his lungs was a very dangerous situation. Thankfully thus far they had been successful in keeping from infecting him, but that wasn’t due to luck – he and Michelle barely took off their face masks, and everything in his flat had been disinfected and re-disinfected again. They were putting their all in keeping him as healthy as they possibly could, and that included him being alone through these awful sessions. He always left with a little less of himself, a part he knew he would be slow at regaining, if he ever did manage to. Another part Michelle would never get to see again. If he got through this and went into remission, which was admittedly a far-cry when he had only started receiving treatment when it had already metastasised, he wouldn’t come out of it whole. He could almost feel the holes this poison drug burned through his veins right to his skin. </p><p>He returned from war, only to walk himself right into another one that only he was a member in. There would be no Reggie’s or battle mates, or even Iraqi girls to carry him to safety now. He started this new war, and he was the only one who was able to fight it. </p><p>Although, he guessed he had a new battle mate. Too bad she had to wait in the car.</p><p>*</p><p>“Hey, Eli, tried to keep the car warm for when you got out. How you doin’, can I get you anything?” Her reassuring voice was a blessed anchor he could grab onto as he stumbled in a miserable haze from the sliding doors and fell into the passenger seat of his car. He always left these sessions hollowed-out, nothing behind his tired eyes except exhaustion and utter emptiness. As he sat panting damply, hand resting on his heaving chest, he fought not to be swept beneath the waves he constantly struggled against, because Michelle didn’t deserve that. He was already at the mercy of his brain tumour to lash out, still struggling to keep some of the Elijah he loved so dearly around. Where would he be to accept all this help from her, when she didn’t need to be doing anything for him, just then to verbally abuse her and curse her out for only trying to help. But it was so fucking hard, these weren’t conscious decisions he was making to act out, given literally any other alternative he would take it in a heartbeat. </p><p>So, unable to look up into the pure expression of concern he just knew would be drawn across her face, he swallowed thickly, tasting blood, and murmured,</p><p>“Thanks, it was fine, I just really want to go home now. I want Private…”</p><p>Private was his blond fox terrier, and without fail he would lay either in his lap or beside him, or at his feet, every single time he came back from chemo, and just that tiny gesture meant the world to him, always at least got him a little bit emotional, which frankly wasn’t hard these days. All he wanted right then was his couch and his baby, Private just seemed to have that ability to warm him when nothing else could, in more ways than just one, and he definitely wanted to get in some much-needed cuddle time before the chemo would catch up with him. At least give him a few minutes.</p><p>*</p><p>After a brief shower in which he just stood beneath the water unmoving, he immediately changed into his comfy pyjamas and a huge hoodie along with a few (dozen) blankets and parked himself on the couch, and much to his joy Private wandered over to him and jumped up beside him, heading for his lap as if on autopilot. He laid down beside him with his head and front feet draped across his lap, and Elijah’s hollow heart swelled oh so subtly, working his real and prosthetic fingers over his almost cotton-y fur, smiling for the first time that day as he murmured,</p><p>“Hey boy, you keeping daddy company?”</p><p>”Of course, why wouldn’t he want to?” Michelle giggled as she walked around the couch to set the bucket which had been appointed specifically to after chemo and nothing else by his feet, the plastic liner within it rustling with each movement. She also placed down his freshly-filled Glospee water bottle, the ice within rattling most satisfyingly, a glass of also iced ginger ale, and his webster pack. “I’ll start making dinner when I’m finished up here, but can I get you anything before I do? Your sketch book or your switch?” </p><p>Elijah still couldn’t handle the look he could hear in her voice, so didn’t meet her gaze when he requested,</p><p>“Probably just the remote today, I am…” he paused to catch his breath and rub at his face, “so, so very tired tonight…”</p><p>Michelle smiled sadly down at her very best friend. What she wouldn’t give to be able to cure him, she so deeply ached to see that old smile of his back on his face, one which told absolutely no tales of what he had seen in life. She hadn’t seen it in so long, even before he had been diagnosed, because the old him had already been in the process of being sapped. Why had this beautiful man had to have been the one to be laid low by his own body like this? Why hadn’t it been her? Why were her own symptoms beginning to go into remission when no one was sure if Elijah would ever have that chance?</p><p>If she kept standing there she may just speak that sentiment aloud, which wasn’t something Elijah necessarily needed to hear, not at least when he was meant to be resting. She reached down for the remote on the coffee table and handed it off to him, her hand lingering on his as she felt her eyes growing warm, a painful mass forming in her throat. It just wasn’t fair…</p><p>*</p><p>It really wasn’t fair. Elijah had eventually turned the tv on to Netflix and had been getting lost in The Haunting of Hill House while Michelle cooked in the background, but gradually he was losing the ability to concentrate on it, and all his focus was instead on how cold he was. Even with all the layers he currently had on, it was doing nothing to gift him any warmth, and he was left violently shivering while pulling all the blankets around him as tightly as he could manage, Private eventually moving himself to be sitting fully in his lap and stretching his head and front feet up to rest on his stomach up to his chest, essentially hugging his person. Elijah would be totally remiss not to hug him back, and making sure the blankets were still covering every possible inch of him, he wrapped his arms around his fuzzy body, nuzzling his face against his baby’s. He made sure to try and keep his teeth from chattering while he was so close to Private’s mouth, he couldn’t risk being licked anywhere near it. He knew then, logically, that he shouldn’t be allowing him to be so close to him, but cuddling with Private was some of the only physical contact he made, Michelle refused to risk it where possible, so he was totally touch-starved, not to mention that his puppy was like a walking heated blanket, how could he possibly keep him away when he was sometimes the only form of warmth he was able to experience? </p><p>He begrudgingly ate the chicken noodle soup Michelle had made, her go-to the first dinner after chemo, grimacing at the thick taste of metal cloying the experience and at the warm food touching the sores in his mouth. Michelle sat in the armchair across from him silently eating her soup, mostly watching her friend struggle with his own. She was proud of him for trying to eat; he still tried, regardless of how much it would soon bite him in the arse. It always did, like clockwork, and yet he gave it a go, every time. She hoped his tv show would be a distraction to him when it eventually did go south. Until then she would watch him, and make silent plans to race for the heavy-duty gloves as soon as she was needed to intervene. </p><p>*</p><p>At least two hours later Elijah had decided he was too tired to remain sitting up, and changed tactics to be curled up in a tight cocoon of blankets, his head resting on a pillow which was wedged between him and Private’s back. Michelle had turned the heating up until she was almost dripping with sweat when he had asked her to, but still, somehow, he was shivering like his life depended on it. He kind of wished he had gone into this as a more overweight person, because at least when he would start unintentionally losing weight he would have a longer time to go before he was skin and bone. He wasn’t entirely there yet, but he was by this point far thinner than he had ever been, and just on that front alone he had next to no heat reserves. </p><p>This utter cold, however, did nothing whatsoever to combat the sweat which soon became forming.</p><p>It seemed to take absolutely no time after its inception that he was thoroughly drenched. Every single article of clothing he had on was at least damp, and still more dripped from every inch of his almost hairless body, finding no pause between that and the shivering which found a similar amount. He absolutely hated this part, it was almost as if he had developed a new layer to his skin made entirely of slippery humidity, and it always left him totally disgusted. No matter of drying off or showering or fucking anything slowed it down, and all it did was cool him down more. He was so freezing. He clutched himself beneath the blankets, his hands slipping on his exposed skin, and moaned. He knew what the next step was.</p><p>And soon it rushed in, seemingly free-falling into him. Nausea swelled in the pit of his stomach, tightening his upper torso and worsening his trembling. This nausea burned his essentially traumatised stomach lining, the contents within seeming to churn in a circular motion, like an overfull blender, while he himself was trapped in a washing machine. He was becoming dizzy and the familiar taste of metal was blooming across the back of his quivering tongue, two more signs he was going to throw up, and soon. It didn’t necessarily scare him, but he knew how much it hurt every time, and how out of breath it left him. It was such an uncomfortable process, and one that wasn’t relieved with its fruition – he would left at the mercy of that process for days to come, more often than not over a week. He was nauseous and vomiting more often than he wasn’t these days, he was admittedly used to it by now, but that didn’t make him any more thrilled about it. </p><p>He tried to swallow it down and ignore it, laser-focussing on the current episode he was on, but even though he had rewatched this show hundreds of times, he couldn’t work out what was happening, as if this was his first viewing. He hadn’t really even broken his attention from it, but that didn’t matter to his foggy, knackered brain; it was as if he hadn’t been paying attention at all, and trying to now was just tiring him out more than he already was. But anything, anything not to focus on the god-awful feeling in his belly.</p><p>But it wasn’t exactly something he could just will away, his reaction to the medicine and to the disease itself wasn’t exactly in his control, and soon enough he felt so sick that it hurt to breathe, and he knew he should start the process of sitting up to grab his bucket (it wasn’t safe for Michelle to come into direct contact with his bodily fluids so the moment he began feeling the possibility of vomiting it was just safest to either grab his bucket or run to the toilet). </p><p>When Elijah began sitting himself up, Michelle knew exactly what he was after, could already see the nausea in his face. She quickly got to her feet and crossed over to him, grabbing up his bucket and plunking it into his lap before sprinting from the room to get her gloves. Elijah was gagging almost as soon as he was upright, clutching to the rim with both hands in a white-knuckled grip, while his stomach visibly pulled inward. H retched desperately, panting just before his ab muscles squeezed hard and a flood of his dinner drained from his mouth and nose, splattering noisily into the plastic liner. </p><p>“Huh, you actually kept that down longer than I thought you would, Eli, congrats,” Michelle half-heartedly joked as she re-entered the room and sat down beside him, rubbing his soggy back as he gutturally gagged, a gurgling growl preceding another thick dousing of dark orange vomit to burst hard from his mouth, leading him to pretty much shove his entire head into the bucket to keep the possibility of a mess to the absolute minimum. </p><p>The explicit sting present in an inordinate number of points in his mouth was made even more obvious when the next time he threw up, blood from his oral sores mixed with the acidic sick to colour the already off-putting orange into a downright panicky red. If it weren’t for its blatant reason, he was sure Michelle would have had him in the emergency department in a heartbeat. If he weren’t mistaken, he was sure she would already be thinking about it regardless, further evidenced by the subtle tightening in the muscles of her hand he was trying to focus on present on his back. Between the ice in his bones, the fire in his mouth, the tight nausea swirling in his belly, the clammy spinning in his head, how much it hurt to breathe, and how badly his body craved to be unconscious, it was all just too much for him. None of this was fair, why the fuck hadn’t he just died in combat instead of coming back disabled at the mercy of his body eventually killing him anyway? He had fought so hard to stay alive, for what? Just so his own body could kill him later and far slower? What had it all been for when his own worst enemy was himself? What hadn’t killed him certainly hadn’t made him stronger. Why had he done this to himself?</p><p>From deep in his battered chest he sobbed, hot tears flooding his eyes, just in time to choke up more seemingly pure acid. The effort of forcing it up and then feeling it on his wounds was an agony he wouldn’t wish on anyone, and one he wished he coud be far away from. He begged his body to cease, please, he just wanted to sleep, but it took many more mouthfuls of vomit to be expelled for him to get a break, finally coming to a stop in a totally breathless state, fighting for air and sobbing raggedly. He knew he should try and calm himself down so he could better catch his breath, but that didn’t mean he knew how. He was in such an acute state of misery, he wished he could be hugged but that wouldn’t be safe. That was why he couldn’t even have an ungloved hand rubbing his back. Why couldn’t he just be normally sick, where sure you didn’t necessarily want to pass it on, but it wasn’t as if your bodily fluids were essentially corrosive in that situation. He could be held without discretion with bare hands, not instead handled like some sick animal. Michelle may as well be wearing a hazmat suit to Elijah’s skewed perception, and there was something really dehumanizing about that which burned him down to his very soul. He knew these precautions she had to take were only for a few days after each infusion, but that still didn’t mean it didn’t somewhat hurt – that was when he needed her the most!</p><p>*</p><p>He had been quick to accept Michelle’s offer to be taken to bed after he finally stopped vomiting for the time being, but had had to be half-dragged half-carried to his bedroom from how absolutely drained of energy he was, sagging heavily on her shoulder while she led him slowly down the hall and to his bed, which he practically fell into. In the time he had been up and walking the temperature had seemed to lower still, and by the time he got to his bed he was seeing double from the shivering, his teeth surely going to break from chattering so hard. He miserably crawled under his blankets and removed his prosthetics while Michelle rushed to grab the rest that were still on the couch, laying them down across his trembling form. He felt so incredibly awful, folding his hands over his still loudly churning belly and groaning. </p><p>He was getting a headache. A disgusted shudder ran down his spine, curling up on his side and whimpering, trying not to start crying all over again. God, please just let him sleep, he was begging now. It wasn’t fair.</p><p>Michelle brought through the freshly scrubbed and lined bucket and sat it on the floor beside his bed, resting his water bottle on the beside table which was cluttered with various pill bottles and boxes.</p><p>“There we go, sweetheart, I’ve let Renee know I’ll be staying over, again, so I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. Just try and get some rest now, you so dearly need it…” she said softly, so wanting to run her fingers through his hair, curl up beside him and hold him until he fell asleep, but not wanting to risk hurting herself. If she were also being honest with herself, she was stressed, for obvious reasons, and desperately wanted a cigarette. She had continued smoking them back at home so to keep it away from him as best she could, but she really desperately wanted one right then, broaching more into the realm of needing it. But where would she be, smoking while looking after her friend with lung cancer? This was an internal fight she was steadily losing at, however, and she was already in the process of figuring out where she would sneak to after he was asleep to get her hit. How could she be so weak? How could she do this to him, and to herself? If not the entire reason Elijah had gotten sick it was at least a high contributor, so why couldn’t she give them up knowing this was an option for her fate to lead her towards? </p><p>Well, they were both addicts. Addiction kind of has a habit of overpowering every morality you have to see itself fed. She truly didn’t want to hurt Elijah. She was just too weak to not.</p><p>* </p><p>“’Chelle?” </p><p>“Yeah, Eli?”</p><p>“Please stop smoking.”</p><p>“Okay, sweetheart.”</p><p>Michelle ran this exchange over and over in her mind as she sat huddled in her car, lighting a cigarette in her clasped hands before inhaling and blowing out its toxic cloud. This had been the last thing he had said before falling asleep, and not even five minutes later here she was, having actively lied to him and doing exactly what he had asked she stop. Tears ran down her cheeks as she sucked on the filled paper, holding it in her mouth before letting it billow out as she sobbed on the exhale, hiding her burning face in shame. What the fuck was she doing? How could this stupid little thing have such a hook on her, when she was actively being shown what could happen to her down the track? She was betraying him, truly she was, and betraying anyone else in their situation, and betraying herself. He had asked her to stop, and she couldn’t. She wanted to grind the cigarette under her foot, stub it out and be done with it, but the thought made her so nauseous that she had to hurriedly take another drag to calm herself down. Quitting was not a likely outcome at any point in her future.</p><p>“I’m so fucking sorry, Elijah…” she moaned in inner turmoil, as she tremulously inhaled pure cancer directly into her lungs, blowing it out in another, even louder sob. </p><p>She’d need another cigarette to calm this crying down. </p>
