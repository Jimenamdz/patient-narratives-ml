It exists in all fronts- diagnosis, management, mortality.<br/><br/>We aim to shed light on existing racial disparities so we as a global oncological community can plan the steps to improve equitable health care for each subset of the population - better access to primary care, mammograms, better representation at clinical trials, access to early management and more universal insurance are some ways we can improve from different angles.<br/><br/><i><b>MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work?</b></i><br/><br/><i><b>Response</b></i>: This is an epidemiological paper demonstrating breakdown of metastatic breast cancer by race, gender and regions.<br/><br/>Future steps in research could be further stratifying data based on ER/PR positivity and analysing respective outcomes, interventional studies that could potentially analyse change in mortality with interventions in place, etc.<br/><br/>Any disclosures?
