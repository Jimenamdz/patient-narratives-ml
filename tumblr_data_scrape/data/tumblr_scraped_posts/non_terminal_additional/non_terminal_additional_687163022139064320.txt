The level of protection provided by prior infection or vaccination with Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines or a combination of both against infection with Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants was unknown.<br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com:  What are the main findings?</i></b><b><i> </i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> The study showed that prior infection combined with three doses of mRNA vaccination was strongly protective against symptomatic Omicron infection and against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19. Meanwhile, two dose vaccination alone was not associated with significant protection against symptomatic infection. Booster vaccination provided only 60% protection against infection but waned rapidly thereafter. However, vaccination was associated with &gt;70% protection against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19.<br/><br/>Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection alone was associated with 50% protection against symptomatic Omicron infection, and did not appear to wane even a year after infection.<br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report?</i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> Vaccination provides protection against COVID-19 severity and enhances protection for those with prior infection against reinfection with new variants.<br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work?</i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> The study findings highlight the importance of better understanding the rapid waning in vaccine-induced immunity in contrast to natural immunity and to develop coronavirus vaccines that are broadly protective against different variants with long-lasting protection.<br/><br/>I have no competing interests to declare.<br/><br/>Citation:<br/><br/>Effect of prior infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity against symptomatic BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron infections and severe COVID-19 in Qatar<br/><br/>Heba N.
