In addition, the diagnoses of early stage lung cancer decreased significantly in comparison to the same period in pre-pandemic years. Early stage diagnoses dropped again, while late stage diagnoses increased in February 2021, when a new wave of COVID-19 infections ravaged the city<br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report?</i></b><b><i> </i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> There was an immediate negative impact on lung cancer diagnoses of COVID-19 restrictions, with a sharp decrease in early stage diagnoses when a “pause” on elective procedures was introduced in 2020, as well as when COVID-19 cases sharply increased during the Winter of 2021. The increase in late stage diagnoses during pandemic surges may reflect the fact that only sick patients with symptoms, and acute events that require immediate care were seeking hospital attention.<br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work?</i></b><b><i> </i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> The data presented suggests that we will likely observe an increase in lung cancer mortality in the next few months and years, as consequence of stage shift at diagnosis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This should be monitored by future studies.<br/><br/><i>No disclosures</i><br/><br/>Citation:<br/><br/>Shift in lung cancer stage at diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City<br/><br/>Raja Flores, Naomi Alpert, Ken McCardle, Emanuela Taioli<br/><br/><a rel="noopener" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-22-191" data-sce-target="_blank">https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-22-191</a><b><i> </i></b><br/><br/><i>The information on MedicalResearch.com is provided for educational purposes only, and is in no way intended to diagnose, cure, or treat any medical or other condition.
