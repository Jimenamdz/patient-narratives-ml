Whether nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir can also help vaccinated people was uncertain.<br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com:  What are the main findings?</i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> When comparing similar patients with early COVID-19 we found that those receiving nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir were approximately 45% less likely to be hospitalized than those that received no treatment. This protection was observed among all groups of patients, including vaccinated and boosted patients.<br/><br/>The overall rate of hospitalization was relatively low among vaccinated patients but it was even lower among those that received nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir.<br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report?</i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> Early treatment with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir can make COVID-19 safer for both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients at elevated risk.<i> </i><b><i> </i></b><br/><br/><b><i>MedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this work?</i></b><br/><br/><b><i>Response:</i></b> We found substantial disparity in prescribing of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir. Further work needed to ensure access to lower-income patients and Black or Hispanic/Latinx patients to this treatment.<b><i> </i></b><br/><br/>No conflicts of interest<br/><br/>Citation:<br/><br/>Nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir for early COVID-19 and hospitalization in a large US health system<br/><br/>Scott Dryden-Peterson, Andy Kim, Arthur Y.
