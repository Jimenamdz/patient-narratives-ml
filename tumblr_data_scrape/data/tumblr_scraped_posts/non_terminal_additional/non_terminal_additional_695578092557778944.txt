It’s okay if you as a disabled person are not independent. It’s okay if you need help doing even the most “basic” of tasks....

It’s okay if you need help doing even the most “basic” of tasks. You’re not less of a person, or less worthy for it. You are not any less lovable, and you <b><i>certainly</i></b> are not a burden. </p><p>It’s absolutely vile that there are people who believe no longer needing help is the absolute goal of living with or treating a disability. Independence isn’t the goal. Happiness is, quality of life is, being able to enjoy things day to day is. If you need a helping hand to get there, that is more than alright. </p></blockquote>
