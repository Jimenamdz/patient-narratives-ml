Friendly reminder that you can always get a second opinion if you aren’t confident in your doctor’s decisions!

<p>Story time!</p><p>Earlier this year, my urologist diagnosed me with interstitial cystitis without performing the tests to confirm the diagnosis. (They’re supposed to perform a cystoscopy to take pictures of the inside of the bladder.) I had an uneasy feeling about the bladder pain I was experiencing, so I got a new urologist. </p><p>Turns out it was bladder cancer! My original doctor would have found it if he’d performed the proper tests, but he was too overworked and decided to skip steps. Thankfully my next doctor was able to get me in quickly and removed the tumor before it had time to spread (it was stage 0). </p><p>I’m currently cancer free. I hate to think about how much worse it could have been if I hadn’t sought a second opinion. </p><p>Trust your gut, people!</p>
