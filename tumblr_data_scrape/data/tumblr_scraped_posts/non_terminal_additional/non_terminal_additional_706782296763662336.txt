I remember back in my grocery store cashier days I did so much crazy shit. </p><p>When WIC (Women, infants, and children voucher program to help low income mothers/families with children) people were in my line I would pretty much know who they were. Before the cards they had to tell us upfront they were WIC and show us their vouchers for what they were allowed to get (it was awful some times. Like. 2 gallons of milk. $4 worth of vegetables etc etc). They’d always have items hanging back, waiting to see what the total was and if they would have to take it off the belt. </p><p>I began to place the fruits/vegetables a certain way on the register scale so that like 1/2lbs of grapes read as like .28lbs or something. Then act shocked when I said that they still had X amount of lbs left. They got all their fruit and vegetables. </p><p>I think it started to kinda? Catch on to the women? Because I would have the same moms in my line month after month. And even after they switched to the cards (they worked like food stamp cards?) I’d still do the same thing. They were able to get more produce  for whatever shitty max amount Indiana gave them. </p><p>Anyways. Be chaotic. It’s more fun that way. </p></blockquote><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1334" data-orig-width="1218"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7633a438708dc9bcf84f0425a0c8a426/9b498f514d84fd0e-e0/s640x960/8d3d82856a30e3a7e0c7d6fcb810fdff9b3d1231.png" data-orig-height="1334" data-orig-width="1218" alt="from iww.org: 

&quot;Good Work&quot; Strikes

One of the biggest problems for service industry workers is that many forms of direct action, such as Slowdowns, end up hurting the consumer (most of them also members of the workering class) more than the boss. One way around this is to provide better or cheaper service -- at the boss' expense, of course.

Workers at Mercy Hospital in France, who were afraid that patients would go untreated if they went on strike, instead refused to file the billing slips for drugs, lab tests, treatments, and therapy. As a result, the patients got better care (since time was being spent caring for them instead of doing paperwork), for free. The hospital's income was cut in half, and panic-stricken administrators gave in to all of the workers' demands after three days.

In 1968, Lisbon bus and train workers gave free rides to all passengers to protest a denial of wage increases. Conductors and drivers arrived for work as usual, but the conductors did not pick up their money satchels. Needless to say, public support was solidly behind these take-no-fare strikers.

In New York City, I.W.W. restaurant workers, after losing a strike, won some of their demands by heeding the advice of I.W.W. organizers to &quot;pile up the plates, give 'em double helpings, and figure the checks on the low side.&quot;" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7633a438708dc9bcf84f0425a0c8a426/9b498f514d84fd0e-e0/s75x75_c1/e8a38bbc5b857a6136352ba27af798577f3bafc8.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7633a438708dc9bcf84f0425a0c8a426/9b498f514d84fd0e-e0/s100x200/f448e38645f752b07c7c7b3bec3512f75a65ffc3.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7633a438708dc9bcf84f0425a0c8a426/9b498f514d84fd0e-e0/s250x400/8a8a4c00100c73564bb314db4831c69ece611392.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7633a438708dc9bcf84f0425a0c8a426/9b498f514d84fd0e-e0/s400x600/b7fde6e770396b3b2b637f72154e1ce5378d6d20.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7633a438708dc9bcf84f0425a0c8a426/9b498f514d84fd0e-e0/s500x750/5d96711b7ae235672e634253ad29c6830f175b36.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7633a438708dc9bcf84f0425a0c8a426/9b498f514d84fd0e-e0/s540x810/55ef9ef791245f5334bdbd318c971c514542602b.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7633a438708dc9bcf84f0425a0c8a426/9b498f514d84fd0e-e0/s640x960/8d3d82856a30e3a7e0c7d6fcb810fdff9b3d1231.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7633a438708dc9bcf84f0425a0c8a426/9b498f514d84fd0e-e0/s1280x1920/cd382b363395f04d9a4a4bd50bf23d76dd294176.png 1218w" sizes="(max-width: 1218px) 100vw, 1218px"><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div></blockquote>
