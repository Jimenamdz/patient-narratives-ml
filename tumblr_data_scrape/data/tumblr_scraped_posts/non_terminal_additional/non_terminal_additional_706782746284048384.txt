Improve and progress as a society. I’m saying this extremely seriously. We have got to get past this. Fucking sick of it. People lose their lives and years to this. Whole generations were ruined by these ideas and expectations.</p></blockquote><p>people are being so fucking weird about this post I swear to fuck I’m literally talking about how being overly conscious about weight to the point of knowing no joy and being too self conscious and afraid to eat fucking cookies. Like shut the god damn hell up fatphobia needs to be discussed as something that destroys peoples’ ability to enjoy things with other people. </p><p>Eating and food are things that bring people together as a community and as friends. I’m talking about this explicitly — fatphobia is extremely bad and it was invented because someone somewhere wanted to sell you your own alienation so they could make more money on you being dissatisfied with something you have actually extremely little control over. Fatphobia is bad. Being discriminatory because of a natural body process is bad. That’s it. That’s the point of this post.</p></blockquote>
