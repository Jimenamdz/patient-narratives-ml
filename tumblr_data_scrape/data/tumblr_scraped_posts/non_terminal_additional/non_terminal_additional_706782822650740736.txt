And I ordered a book cushion from etsy, and I just wanna say to anyone who has thought &ldquo;that adaptive thing seems like it would be useful, but I&rsquo;m not disabled, so maybe it&rsquo;s not for me?&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s for you. Trust me. My back hurt because I was slouching weird on the couch. I got a husband pillow. It helped a lot. But, it turns out, what I need is one giant piece of memory foam, not a bunch of tiny bits. </p><p>And the book cushion? Books are heavy sometimes. Being able to rest it higher in my lap so it&rsquo;s easier to read and hold? Better for my body. </p><p>Also, do you wake up with pain in the mornings? Try a contour pillow and a knee pillow. </p><p>Get those extra-strong treaded soles to wear with your heels because you wobble otherwise. </p><p>Wear compression gloves when you type. Get those orthopedic shoes because you can walk longer distances in more comfort. Buy the bra that actually supports the weight of your boobs. Get a lapdesk for your computer. Use a neck pillow even at home to keep your neck straight. Wear socks to bed. Listen to audiobooks. Read large print books. </p><p>You see something that you think will work for you and improve how you feel? Use it! Let&rsquo;s fucking normalize adaptative shit for everyone! </p></blockquote><p>Also, don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;Oh but I&rsquo;m taking this from a disabled person&rdquo;</p><p>The more people who use assistive devices, and show demand for assistive devices, THE MORE THEY MAKE AND THE BETTER THEY GET.</p><p>The best example of this I can think of is canes. When I started using a cane 10 years ago, they were either one color, or old lady patterns. There were all of two grip designs, and they honestly kinda sucked.</p><p>Now, as more and more people have realized they need them, and have gotten them earlier in their lives for a variety of problems, canes are SO DOPE NOW.</p><p>You can get them in Galaxy print! Neon colors! Different ergonomic grips! You can even get what I have, which is angle-adjustable arm crutches!! </p><p>Overcome your internal ableism, and let yourself use the thing that prevents pain or makes your life easier. This disabled person can tell you it&rsquo;s 100% worth it.</p></blockquote>
