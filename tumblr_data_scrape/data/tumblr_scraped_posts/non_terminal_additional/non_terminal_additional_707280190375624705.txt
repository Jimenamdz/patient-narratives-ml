But a coworkers dog died and among all the condolences and stuff he was recieving was a disturbing amount of people who go out of their way to explain how much more they care about animals than people.  </p><p>Two guys were on the verge of tears over this acquaintances dog and then claimed they don’t even cry when family members have died. That’s fucked up and he’s telling us this like it’s a point of pride. One guy even said he cares more about his dog than he does his kids. Sorry that’s not fucking normal or healthy, that’s weird and you should work on that and maybe never tell anyone else.</p></blockquote>
