Life Update!

<p>I know these are never ever popular but I just need everyone to know two things:</p><p>1. I’m going to start posting here more often both as re-communicating with fandoms I enjoy (And to look at everyone’s swanky art) and as a way to hopefully inform people of the Murder Mystery Podcast I’m working on called the ‘Tarot Killer.’</p><p>2. I have colon cancer so things are rough right now. But don’t worry! The doctor seems to like my odds. She says colon cancer is ‘Very treatable,’ which tells me I’ll be fine. It’s just gonna suck for a minimum of five years. =3=</p>
