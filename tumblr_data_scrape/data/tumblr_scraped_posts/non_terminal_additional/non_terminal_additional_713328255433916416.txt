This Image Had Me Thinking

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="847" data-orig-width="699"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d670d27d57f104bf0929a7d8dd159ac0/61cc95e48bb90cec-72/s540x810/4d026e093b59da7e0c3afda8aa9655800949bbfd.jpg" data-orig-height="847" data-orig-width="699"/></figure><p>So this is one of the gallery photos for Clown’s new project Welcome Home, a children’s puppet show horror found-footage type creation. Like many others, I’m hooked. I also have a somewhat strangely large well of knowledge when it comes to the darker side of children’s programming.</p><p>Now I don’t know what to call this, ‘cause it’s not exactly a ‘theory,’ more of a recollection, perhaps. I don’t actually think this is something that will reflect from the show, but it just has some sort of eerie link in my brain. </p><p>The image shown is a young girl mangled in the background, holding a hammer, with Welcome Home’s character Julie in the front. It could be the similarly blond hairdo, or the name being so close, but this image reminds me of Judith Barsi, the young girl who voiced parts Duckie from “A Land Before Time” and Ann-Marie from “All Dogs Go To Heaven,” The latter being her last role.</p><p>It was her last role because, at 10 years old, Judith and her mother was killed by her father who immediately committed suicide after the gruesome act.</p><p>Art often imitates life. For a moment, I wondered if Judith Barsi’s story somewhat inspired whatever story the little girl in this picture has. Could she be Julie’s voice? Was the little girl also a child actress taken way before her time? And why is the flower with eyes that she’s holding the same color pallet as Wally Darling?</p><p>The flower is actually a Pansy, which is a flower often used to symbolize Love (Romantic or platonic), and Remembrance. Also compassion, thoughtfulness, and Free-Thinking. I don’t think that’s on accident.</p>
