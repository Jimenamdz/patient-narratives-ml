#153 Quantum Violence.

<h1>#153 Quantum Violence.</h1><p>I&rsquo;ve been full of cold and fever all week. Mostly better now apart from hacking up my lungs a lot. Ow, bleh, etc etc.</p><p>However many posts back, I talked about the random people in this house who wandered in and out and I had no idea who they were. I mentioned a purple pixie lady in the kitchen (and if I didn’t call her that I should have)… turns out she’s the landlady. Cool, good to know.</p><p>Landlady has a PHD in physics, is obsessed with nutrition and practices acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. (Before I continue, I would like to state that I am aware that acupuncture and Herbal Medicine – Chinese or otherwise – can do amazing things. But I’m also aware of the number of people who take some sort of online course, get a certificate from the University of Bullshit, and brazenly practice their ‘craft’ on actual people.) </p><p>Today, Landlady told me about a woman from Brazil she’d treated who had cancer. (I don’t know what it is about the chemo look, but everybody suddenly wants to chat to you about bloody cancer.) Landlady had treated her with acupuncture and with herbal teas and tinctures. The cancer had gone into remission. ‘Oh!’ exclaimed Brazilian lady. ‘I can’t believe it!’ And she went home, where upon it was discovered her cancer was back. This, according to Landlady, was Brazilian woman’s own fault because she didn’t believe it so she messed it all up – because QUANTUM!!</p><p>Do you know how much willpower I had to burn through to keep my expression mild and not brain her with a skillet?</p><p>I’m all for any weird and wonderful additional treatment you care to take with your chemo and surgeries. But what pisses me off an apocalyptic amount is when people with very serious life-threatening medical issues are given false hope – and worse, made to waste time – with random bollocks that might make you feel holistically healthier but won’t do a damn thing to fix the underlying problem that’s killing you.</p><p>Bitch, if fucking acupuncture and some tea could fix me, don’t you think the hospitals would be offering that instead of the incredibly expensive and poisonous course of treatment they gave me? Also (do I really have to point this out?) medicine isn’t something that requires belief to function. If it requires belief, it is at its base, a placebo. Look, I think quantum is great too – I love the fact that you can kinda explain sympathetic magic via string theory. But again, if Quantum was powerful and reliable enough to kick the shit out of cancer, I wouldn’t have gone to the Infusion Centre every three weeks I’d have gone to the Quantum Detanglement Centre or something.
