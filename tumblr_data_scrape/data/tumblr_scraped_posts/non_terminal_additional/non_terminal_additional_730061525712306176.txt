#155 Oh joy.

<h1>#155 Oh joy.</h1><p>I am so monumentally angry right now. And I know I shouldn&rsquo;t be, because it&rsquo;s pointless, and yet I can&rsquo;t help but be fucking furious.</p><p>Last night Hippy Boy decided to tell me that, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re had a cure for cancer since the 1930s&hellip;&rdquo; Said it like everyone knew that, obviously, and I was sadly behind the times.</p><p><br/></p><p>H̴̨̩̳̭͓͉̺̋̊̾̾͒̆̕̚͝a̵̧̯̭̤̭͙̫̮̾͂́̍̈́̚̚͠v̵͖̪̰̥̲̜̲̜̼̫̔͝ẽ̶̤̹̓̅ ̶̗̭̳́͑́̐̍̉t̶́͜ȟ̶̡̛͇̼͙̭̏̆̆̑͑̕e̷͇͙̽̄̽̈́͊̐̅ͅy̶̦̬̞̖̭̭͈͋͑̓̓̅̊͒̀ ̵̞͈͚͎͗͗͊̓̀̈́̔̑͑ň̴̯͍̻̹̿̓̂͗ò̸̮͊̈͐̃ẉ̵̨̛̮̥̬̬͕͙̠͂?̵̯͊͐͒͋̈́̈͊̔̈</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Hahah ha haha ha ha hahaha. ha. ha. haha. Haaaahahah. Ha. ha ha ha. I&rsquo;m gonna fucking throw up. Haahahah. ha. hahaha. ha&hellip;</i></b></p><p>Oh goody my life is complete. Bet you think I&rsquo;m an utter moron for letting doctors cut off my tit and give me medical grade poison, hey? I mean, how dumb am I?! Thank goodness you were there to set me straight and tell it like it is. What a pity no one other than YOU seems to know about this marvellous miracle cure we&rsquo;ve had for almost 100 years. Awfully harsh of you to only mention this life altering fact AFTER I had the surgery and the chemo. Still, I guess I don&rsquo;t need the radiation therapy or the oestrogen blockers now! Thanks so much!</p><p>I don&rsquo;t like violence but if Hippy Boy keeps saying shit like this to me he will get a skillet to the face.</p><p>(Who the fuck says that to someone who&rsquo;s just finished chemo? Seriously - what the hell is wrong with him? Between him and the landlady banging on about nanobots in vaccines, the curative power of quantum, and how the government is going to brain-blast everyone on Oct 4th, I am seconds away from committing very great violence.)</p>
