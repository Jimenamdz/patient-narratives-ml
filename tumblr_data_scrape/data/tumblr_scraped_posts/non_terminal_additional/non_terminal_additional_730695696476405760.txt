#156 Insurance. Again.

<h1>#156 Insurance. Again.</h1><p>I adore how everything to do with insurance takes weeks. Oh wait no I don&rsquo;t - no one bloody does. </p><p>So despite the fact my insurance had been updated and reinstated, nothing further could be done until the $23 bill for this month had been paid. And that couldn&rsquo;t be paid until the new insurance cards turned up in the post which had the magical new insurance ID numbers on them. </p><p>The cards have at long last turned up and the bill has been paid, meaning I can finally schedule the start of my radiation therapy.</p><p>I understand that all bureaucratic systems rely on the <i>correct</i> information being filed in the <i>correct</i> place to function correctly. But this is the first time I&rsquo;ve been in a system that essentially kicks you out and requires you to start again at square one any time it encounters what it perceives as an anomaly. This would be grossly inconvenient were it to happen in any bureaucracy, but the fact that it dictates whether or not I can receive medical attention is mind boggling to me. (We still have no idea why all this happened. Apparently the government suddenly decided &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not eligible&rsquo;. When we asked why, the government said 'what? idk, haha, you are eligible, my bad, just go re-submit all your info and apply again&rsquo;.) Gah.</p><p>TL;DR - I have medical insurance again. (At last.<i> Again.</i>) Yey! </p>
