#157 Zombies!

<h1>#157 Zombies!</h1><p>Or not. </p><p>The emergency broadcast system was tested on Oct 4th. The landlady had requested that we turn our phones and computers off and that the broadband be disconnected. She had also apparently rigged up some sort of faraday cage around the whole property to protect it. (The only evidence of this I saw was a bed frame propped up against a chair with a plant on it across the driveway.)</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t turn off my laptop or my phone, was woken by an obnoxious alert at 8.30 in the morning, and promptly did not turn into a zombie. Thank goodness for that potted plant and old bed frame - phew!</p><p>In other news, the landlady would like me to adapt her novel, &lsquo;A Quantum Love Story&rsquo; into a script so it can be adapted to film. She offered to pay me in therapy to help me get over the effects of chemo. I said I&rsquo;d recovered from all that, thank you. She looked meaningfully at the many scars all over my wrists and arms and said her therapies could help with other things too. I smiled and said thank you, I was fine. (My scars are numerous and deep but they are also old.) I&rsquo;ve never had someone look at my scars and immediately try to use them as leverage in a business transaction. Special.</p>
