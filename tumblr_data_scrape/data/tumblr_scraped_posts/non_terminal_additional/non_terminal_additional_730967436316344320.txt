#158 Hawi.

<h1>#158 Hawi.</h1><p>(In case you were wondering, it&rsquo;s pronounced &lsquo;Hah-vee&rsquo;.)</p><p>A friend of a friend is building a new Ohana on their property.

My husband&rsquo;s name was also dropped rather heavily as 'someone who used to work construction and may be able to help finish the project more quickly&rsquo;.</p><p>Everything on Island that doesn&rsquo;t concern medical or legal matters seems to get done via friends of friends, and it&rsquo;s always a coin toss as to whether it ends up being legitimate or a pipe dream.</p><p>Hawi is a tiny town consisting of one and a half streets and has a thriving artistic community, and quite a few tourists in season. The property is three minutes away from the local farmers&rsquo; market, so it would be easy for me to sell my art prints and jewellery. Also it would be nice to escape the mad landlady&hellip;</p>
