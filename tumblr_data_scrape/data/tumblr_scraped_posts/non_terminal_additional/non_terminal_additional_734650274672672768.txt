My name is Maggie and I’m 25 years old (they/them). I have a beautiful 4 year old daughter and a wonderful fiancé who I’ve been engaged to for a while now but we’ve held off wedding planning due to financial struggles. Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with stage three cancer and had to go through chemo from February to August. I’m currently in remission (yay!) but because I was going through treatment for so long, I wasn’t working and eventually lost my job. I’m currently trying to collect unemployment but it’s still not enough to live off of. I still have to pay rent, buy food, pay medical bills, gas, etc. I’m panicking because I’m almost at the point of becoming homeless and not having enough to eat. If you could please donate, I would be forever grateful. Thank you in advance and Happy Holidays ❤️</p>
