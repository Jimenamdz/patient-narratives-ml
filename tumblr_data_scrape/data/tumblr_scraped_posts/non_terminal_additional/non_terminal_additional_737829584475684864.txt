Nothing shuts down a bougie conversation like "well, when I was homeless—" Nothing. It's one and done. They are fucking taken...

It&rsquo;s one and done. They are fucking taken out. The conversation is dead. Done. </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;there&rsquo;s enough charities in place to help our homeless population&rdquo;</p><p>Well I was turned away from every single one in the area because I was a non Christian trans person. Not that there were many I could make the walk to, to be fair.</p><p>&ldquo;if someone is homeless, they can just forage for food! Probably eating healthier than we are har har har!&rdquo;</p><p>I was homeless in winter. And yeah, sure, I knew how to use pine needles to make tea and boil bark but. Come on. You think every homeless person has that fucking knowledge or resources? And I was homeless on a <i>mountain</i>. What about people who are homeless in <i>cities</i>? What are they going to forage? Gravel? And what about areas where foraging is illegal? You want them to get <i>arrested</i>? In a police state like <i>this</i>?</p><p>&ldquo;well as long as they don&rsquo;t get into trouble, there won&rsquo;t be trouble!&rdquo;</p><p>You make laws criminalizing their existence. The &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; they make is <i>surviving</i>. I got the cops called on me because I went for a walk. I had a stick I was using to help me walk because I have a limp and couldn&rsquo;t afford a cane. A fucking white couple saw me and called the cops and told them I was walking &ldquo;with a rifle&rdquo; and was &ldquo;very threatening&rdquo;. I got DAMNED lucky that a Light horseman found me first and told me what happened. Laughed a little. Told me not to worry about it, he&rsquo;d call it in as bogus, and have a talk with the couple. But again. I was lucky. If that had been a state cop and not a rez one, I could have been fucking shot. For <i>walking</i>.</p><p><br/></p><p>Honestly, if you are not for the liberation of homeless people, if you are not for decriminalizing homelessness and all aspects of it, if you say things like, &ldquo;now I support those people, but I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to see it, because it makes me uncomfy,&rdquo; you have swallowed the propaganda pill. Congrats. You were not immune to it and now you are sick with it.</p></blockquote>
