It&rsquo;s ok to be upset that you&rsquo;re poor and wishing to be rich. I understand.  People who say that money doesn&rsquo;t buy happiness have never eaten pasta every day because it&rsquo;s 50 cents at the grocery store or been short on money for christmas presents. Constantly scraping by makes people miserable and depressed and of course you&rsquo;re gonna dream about money, about being happy and priviledged. That&rsquo;s not greedy or horrible, that&rsquo;s life. It&rsquo;s ok.</p></blockquote><p>Also, something I feel like gets lost on the people who keep repeating that “money doesn’t buy happiness” is that money itself isn’t going to make you happy. Or getting additional money when you have plenty isn’t going to instantly make you happier. But financial safety is one of the most universal aspects of happiness in the world we live in (even if we wish this wasn’t the case). Like the money itself isn’t going to make you happier, but not worrying about rent will. Getting to have hobbies will. Making your favourite meal will. Meeting a friend for a coffee and a cake will. Being able to afford those things without mental and financial strain <i>will</i>. </p></blockquote>
