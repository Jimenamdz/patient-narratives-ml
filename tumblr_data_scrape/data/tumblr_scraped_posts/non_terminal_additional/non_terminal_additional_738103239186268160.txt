<p>I contacted the closest related cousin off of my list of DNA matches. She&rsquo;s twice my age. My message got ignored for the longest time but then she finally got back today. She said she found out how we&rsquo;re related. Which means she must know which one of her uncles is my birth dad? I could be wrong but I think that&rsquo;s what that means. She hasn&rsquo;t responded yet but I&rsquo;m really desperate to know tbh. What&rsquo;s his name? Why did he abandon me? Do I have any siblings? Does anybody care that I exist? Does he know my name? What kind of food does he like? I&rsquo;m struggling so much. I don&rsquo;t think he cares and I&rsquo;m scared that&rsquo;s the truth. Maybe they don&rsquo;t want me and don&rsquo;t like my mom. I wouldn&rsquo;t blame them</p>
