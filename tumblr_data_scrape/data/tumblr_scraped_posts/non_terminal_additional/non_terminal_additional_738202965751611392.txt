<p>I had a long phone call about my birth dad and his/our(?) whole side of the family. Can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that  I literally should not have been born. He had a family and two kids! What the hell was my mom thinking? I feel like she used me as a bargaining chip and didn&rsquo;t care about me anyways. She abused him and I! When he wanted to support me she said no because he didn&rsquo;t want her and if she couldn&rsquo;t have him then neither could I. I feel very sad. She told me that proudly before and didn&rsquo;t care about ripping me from my entire family. I have a sister. She&rsquo;s way older than me. She was looking for me too. Just a lot to take in. I&rsquo;m too ashamed to tell them I&rsquo;m not doing okay. I don&rsquo;t think they really want me around after all this time. They talked about cutting out negativity and having a close-knit circle. Feels like if they knew about me, they&rsquo;d label me as negativity and shoo me away. My aunt said that you can&rsquo;t trust anybody in this world and that you can&rsquo;t rely on anybody either. Why? I&rsquo;m sad. Mad at my mom. She still won&rsquo;t respond to me after telling her I know my dad&rsquo;s name now. She refused to tell it to me </p>
