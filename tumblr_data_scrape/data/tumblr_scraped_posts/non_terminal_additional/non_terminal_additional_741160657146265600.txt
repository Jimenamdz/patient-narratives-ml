I have just been diagnosed with stage 0 breast cancer. No I didn’t know there was a stage 0 either. It is 100% survivable and 100% treatable. It’s called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). I have one spot that is DCIS and one spot that is pre-DCIS. I’m meeting with the surgeon on Monday to discuss how much stuff is getting removed and when that is happening.</p><p>I’m good. Family is good. This is pretty much the best news we could have gotten given the situation. But it’s been hanging over me since October. I didn’t get the MRI until the beginning of January, and then didn’t get the biopsy until two weeks ago, and just got the official results today. Hence the not being as active online for a while. I’ll update you all when we have a treatment plan.</p><p>So, that’s what I’ve been up to. I guess this counts as starting the year on a high note? Sort of? XD&rdquo;</p>
