What It’s Like To Be On The Internet In 2024 — Sean Curry

<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="https://seancurry1.tumblr.com/post/738775616237797376/what-its-like-to-be-on-the-internet-in-2024" target="_blank">seancurry1</a>:</p><blockquote><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>The problem with the previous ~10 years of the internet, an era defined by algorithmic social media feeds and endless growth, isn’t that the platforms have all my friends and their updates locked up in their walled gardens, although that’s certainly part of it. Nor is the problem that they’re all trying to make money, although that’s definitely part of it.*</p></blockquote><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>The problem isn’t even the Nazis, white nationalists, Chris Rufos, TERFs, and all other manners of asshole that barge into spaces created and populated by well-meaning people, shit on the floor, and yell at everyone who asks them to clean it up and not do it again.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>The problem is that the people in charge of those spaces won’t stop them from coming back.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>What do you do when a party host won’t kick out the wild drunk that’s ruining the party? You find a new party. What do you do when the wild drunk shows up again and your new host also won’t kick them out? What do you do when this happens again, and again, and again?</p></blockquote><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>What do you do when every single party you’ve been going to for the last decade keeps having the same wild drunk show up and shit on the floor?</p></blockquote><p>I wrote about how the internet has changed, and how it’s changing again, over on my blog.

<p>So hey, you know how I said if we keep relying on platforms to build our audiences, we&rsquo;ll only end up having to rebuild on a new platform every 2-3 years?</p><p class="npf_link" data-npf='{"type":"link","url":"https://homewiththearmadillo.blog/2024/04/02/substack-is-setting-writers-up-for-a-twitter-style-implosion/","display_url":"https://homewiththearmadillo.blog/2024/04/02/substack-is-setting-writers-up-for-a-twitter-style-implosion/","title":"Substack Is Setting Writers Up For A Twitter-Style Implosion","description":"When Substack tanks — and I think its right-wing, Musk-flavored, tech-bro-brained management indicates that it will — it will be the Twitter","site_name":"Home With The Armadillo","poster":[{"media_key":"35514a18d3db2d83f3153da887ef57e4:daea5d497ca05df4-11","type":"image/png","width":1198,"height":570}]}'><a href="https://homewiththearmadillo.blog/2024/04/02/substack-is-setting-writers-up-for-a-twitter-style-implosion/" target="_blank">Substack Is Setting Writers Up For A Twitter-Style Implosion</a></p><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>But when Substack tanks — and I think its right-wing, Musk-flavored, tech-bro-brained management indicates that it will — it won’t just mean losing the audience for our 280-character late-night gummy jokes and covfefe memes. It won’t just mean losing a huge community of colleagues and readers. It will mean losing a substantial portion of the audience for content that takes a hell of a lot more effort to produce — the thoughtful rants, the reported deep-dives, the serial fiction, the smart criticism. <b>And without access to “follower” lists and emails, there will be no way to find them again. Writers will, once again, have to rebuild from near-scratch elsewhere.</b></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s happening again. It&rsquo;s happening <i>again</i>, just as it will always happen when we build our audiences on platforms owned by people that are beholden to shareholders and investors.</p><p>We have to build and manage our own platforms. These social platforms—Tumblr included—can be used to drive people <i>to</i> those platforms, but if we rely on these companies to maintain and manage our platforms for us, we are inevitably going to have to rebuild elsewhere.</p>
