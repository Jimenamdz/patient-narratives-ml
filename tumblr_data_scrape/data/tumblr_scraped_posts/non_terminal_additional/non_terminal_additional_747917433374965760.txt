South Africa had more resources than Israel does, it could hold out so much longer and still the apartheid was ended by people working tirelessly and boycotting and pushing for divestment and sanctions. These methods will work for freeing Palestine too. </p><p>I know it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there have been many successes, but all the politicians are feeling the pressure. Pressure that we are able to sustain and even increase as we come up with new initiatives and convince new people to join. </p><p>One of the reasons they&rsquo;re resisting our pressure so strongly is because they know that when we see gains we will push harder, we will continue to push until the stones falling becomes a rock fall and Palestine&rsquo;s freedom is secured. They know if we get a taste of the power we can wield we&rsquo;ll turn that onto freeing Congo too. They know we&rsquo;re unhappy and have been for a long time and their very secure system starts to look a lot less secure when we start mobilising to change things.</p></blockquote>
