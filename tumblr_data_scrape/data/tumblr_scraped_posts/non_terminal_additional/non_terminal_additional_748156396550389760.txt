I would prefer no one else be in the bathroom. and if someone else is in the bathroom I am going to ignore them as much as possible. I did not go into the bathroom to connect with other women. I went into the bathroom to piss and/or shit. it&rsquo;s a toilet&rsquo;s space, not a women&rsquo;s space. shut the fuck up and let trans people piss and shit in peace. let&rsquo;s all continue to avoid eye contact with each other and any and all interaction in the toilet&rsquo;s space.</p></blockquote>
<p>“oh, you want some of the public space for yourself? ok. you know the place you piss and/or shit in?”</p>
