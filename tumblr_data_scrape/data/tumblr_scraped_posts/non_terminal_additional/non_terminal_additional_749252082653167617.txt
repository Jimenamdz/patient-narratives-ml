Their training goes higher up the chain. There are some amazing advances made in medicine. Still, it is over-used and abused. Medicine and surgeries should rarely be the first line of defense. </p><p><br/></p><p>THE PROBLEM: The medical system (funded by big pharma) only trains physicians in medicine with maybe 25 hours of nutritionâ€¦if youâ€™re lucky. In addition, doctors receive incentives from pharmaceutical companies to endorse them. (Donâ€™t take my word for it, look this up!) Big pharma has their tentacles everywhere. Still think itâ€™s about health?</p><p><br/></p><p>If you visit a western medicine doctorâ€™s office, you are not being told all of your options because of the biased training they received. Once in a while you might meet a doctor who further educated themselves in nutrition because they woke up to this and wanted to better help his/her patients. Those are rare gems, but they are out there. Medicine is great for acute or emergency situations, but nutrition (and stress/emotional management) is when true healing takes place. ðŸ§¬ </p>
