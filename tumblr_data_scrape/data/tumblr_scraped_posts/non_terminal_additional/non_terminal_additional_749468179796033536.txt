This is beneficial for anyone with inflammation, or athletes needing recovery. I often point my clients to these therapies because of their science-backed benefits. Here are some I enjoyed today&hellip;.</p><p><br/></p><p>RED LIGHT THERAPY - improves cellular function and health by enhancing mitochondrial function and improving the production of ATP (cells energy source)</p><p><br/></p><p>LYMPHATIC MASSAGE (the big squeeze) - stimulates the lymphatic system responsible for transporting white blood cells to help fight infection and strengthen immune system</p><p><br/></p><p>CRYOTHERAPY (cold therapy) - lowers oxidative stress (free radicals) and inflammation by reducing the production and release of pro-inflammatory substances (eg. cytokines) while increasing the release of anti-inflammatory substances (noradrenaline)</p><p><br/></p><p>If this Hawaiian can do cryotherapy, so can you! Thank you Tom, Prosper &amp; Nate ü§ôüèΩ</p>
