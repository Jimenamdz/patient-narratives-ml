Cerebral Palsy and Autism Spectrum Disorder Functioning

<h1>Cerebral Palsy and Autism Spectrum Disorder Functioning</h1><p>Over the years and with the help of my blog, I am able to piece my disabilities together. Also, with the help of medical notes and further research I am finally able to bring my physical, mental and emotional disabilities together, so that I can move forward with certainty.</p><p>Growing up without knowing about either disability, I don&rsquo;t have normal functioning. I am sorry if this sounds like or feels like a repeat. I need to be sure; to place both of my disabilities.</p><p><b>Cerebral Palsy</b></p><p>I have Cerebral palsy and autism. They are two separate conditions that co-occur. Cerebral Palsy affects muscle co-ordination and my muscle tone is mostly affected. I have difficulty in regulating emotions and feelings due to the impact it has on the brain and nervous system. I also have trouble expressing myself, understanding social cues and managing emotions in a typical way. I deal with anxiety, low-line depression, and those can lead to frustrations and challenges. Like all disabilities, there needs to be an acceptance from others on what we deal with.</p><p><b>Autism Spectrum Disorder</b></p><p>Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterised by challenges with social interaction, communication and repetitive behaviours. I have intellectual disabilities, while others with autism may have average or above-average intelligence. I have strengths in areas such as attention to detail and memory. I take things literal, find it hard to understand humour and sarcasm. Most often I need to be in the same routine and can get anxious if that were to change. I can get anxious in social situations, or going into new situations without researching what they may look or feel like. I deal with sensory issues.</p><p><b>Living with both disorders</b></p><p>Living with cerebral palsy and autism means I have unique challenges and needs relating to both. I mostly struggle with mental functioning. In Brexit and Covid-19, around their handling, autism became my biggest challenge, when anxiety and depression began to see the light of day. Before that, both were easier to contain.</p><p>For more inspirational, lifestyle blogs, please check out my site <a href="https://www.thecpdiary.com">https://www.thecpdiary.com</a></p>
