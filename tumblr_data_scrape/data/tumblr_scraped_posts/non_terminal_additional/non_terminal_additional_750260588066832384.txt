Working with Multiple Health Conditions

<h1>Working with Multiple Health Conditions </h1><p>Since my twin died 16 months ago, I am facing a complex set of mental health challenges, including tinnitus and insomnia brought about through the stress of losing my twin and having to live with facial pain from a swollen muscle for 10+ months, two months after she died. The trauma has been immense.</p><p>The addition of autism, anxiety and depression is make everyday tasks more challenging. Trying to make new situations fit that don&rsquo;t fit is making my health worse. I need to start making different decisions.</p><p><b>The loss of my twin</b></p><p>The loss of my twin and having to live my life without her, is further compounding these challenges, affecting my overall quality of life. My late diagnosis adds another layer of complexity, requiring me to continue to adjust to knowledge about my condition and continually reassessing past experiences. With no discussions or explanations around those issues, my mental challenges haven&rsquo;t gone away.</p><p><b>Navigating &lsquo;daily life&rsquo;</b></p><p>With a mental disability, navigating daily life is particularly demanding. It is important to find understanding, support and acceptance, towards overcoming obstacles, despite the challenges we all face.</p><p>For more inspirational, life-changing blogs, please check out my site <a href="https://www.thecpdiary.com">https://www.thecpdiary.com</a></p>
