Secondary Trauma

<h1>Secondary Trauma</h1><p>Experiencing trauma that doesn&rsquo;t directly belong to you typically refers to secondary trauma, second hand trauma, or vicarious trauma. This occurs when an individual is indirectly exposed to traumatic events through hearing about or witnessing the experiences of others. For example, healthcare professionals, first responders, therapists and journalists. Individuals exposed, having to support loved ones through traumatic experiences might encounter secondary trauma. Secondary trauma is the reason I sustained a mouth muscle injury and the reason why I have tinnitus and the reason why on occasion I am failing to cope.</p><p><b>The Research</b></p><p>&ldquo;According to Saba Harouni Lurie, LMFT and founder of Take Root Therapy, secondary trauma is a stress response in reaction to hearing about or being witness to the firsthand traumatic experience of another. Firsthand trauma can be in the form of emotional distress or physical pain. Secondary trauma develops when hearing about someone else’s trauma and the intense, persistent stress that can come with that is a consistent part of someone’s life.&rdquo; (Source: psychcentralcom)</p><p><b>Emotional and psychological effects</b><br/><br/>This form of trauma can have significant emotional, psychological, and even physical effects on individuals, leading to symptoms similar to those experienced by direct trauma survivors, such as anxiety, nightmares, depression, flashbacks and feelings of helplessness or guilt.</p><p><b>Secondary trauma: practice self-care</b><br/><br/>It is essential for those exposed to secondary trauma to practice self-care, seek support and, if needed, get professional help to process their emotions and prevent burnout. Additionally, creating boundaries, practicing mindfulness and engaging in activities that promote relaxation and wellbeing, can be beneficial in coping with secondary trauma. It is important not to own trauma that doesn&rsquo;t belong to you.</p><p>Ways to support someone who has experienced trauma include:</p><ul><li>Listening without judgment and offering a safe space for them to share their feelings and experiences.</li><li>Validating their feelings and letting them know that it&rsquo;s okay to feel the way they do.</li><li>Offering to help in practical ways, such as helping them connect with resources.</li><li>Encouraging them to seek professional help if needed and remind them that it&rsquo;s okay to ask for help.</li><li>Being patient and understanding that healing from trauma takes time.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s okay not to have all the answers or solutions to support someone who has experienced trauma. Simply being there for them and showing that you care, makes a big difference in their healing.</p><p>For more inspirational, lifestyle blogs, please check out my site <a href="https://www.thecpdiary.com">https://www.thecpdiary.com</a></p>
