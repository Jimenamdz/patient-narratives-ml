The CP Diary: 14-Today

<h1>The CP Diary: 14-Today</h1><p>The CP Diary is 14 years old today. I wrote my first ever blog for the diary on the 17th of May 2010. Now, as it enters its 15th year, I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground. There&rsquo;s a lot to read, but don&rsquo;t be put off by the amount. Instead, be encouraged to continue to &lsquo;turn the pages&rsquo;.</p><p>In these 14 years, I want to thank you the reader, for your continued support. I hope there can be more growth and that my blog can continue to make a positive impact. This is a milestone I didn’t think about, let alone imagine I would reach.</p><p><b>Piecing my life and experiences together</b></p><p>I can&rsquo;t describe how I feel, but I am grateful. Although I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get over not knowing about my disability, I am comforted by the fact that I know everything about my disability now and that I have been able to piece that, my experiences and my life together.</p><p>But my blog isn&rsquo;t just a personal blog. I write from a universal standpoint, which means anyone and everyone can resonate with my words. As I continue to write about the things that affect us in our everyday lives, I hope you will stay and continue to read.</p><p><b>It&rsquo;s not only a blog for me</b></p><p>I write from a universal standpoint, which means anyone and everyone can resonate with my words. As I continue to write about the things that affect us in our every day, I hope you will continue to read.</p><p><i>My blog is a 'healing blog&rsquo; but we have to put the time in to want to read, to want to heal.</i></p><p><b>Thank you&hellip;</b><br/><br/>I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has physically contributed to my blog over the years and to all my readers. Your support means the world to me.</p><p><b>It is important to navigate all challenges</b></p><p>We have all been profoundly affected by events like Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. These times have changed us and have had a significant impact on our mental health. I know firsthand how important it is to navigate these challenges and writing has been a crucial outlet for me.</p><p><b>Please continue to stay and to continue to read</b></p><p>I hope that you find value in my words and continue to stay with me on this journey. There is a lot of ground to cover, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that you can&rsquo;t put a price on mental health. I know what my writing does for me – I hope you will take the time, to stay on my blog and continue to read.</p><p>For more inspirational, lifestyle blogs, please check out my site <a href="https://www.thecpdiary.com">https://www.thecpdiary.com</a></p>
