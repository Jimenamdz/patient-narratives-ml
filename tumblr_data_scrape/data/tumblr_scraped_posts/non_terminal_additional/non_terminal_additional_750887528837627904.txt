Subconscious Check-In

<h1>Subconscious Check-In</h1><p>I’ve been tapping into my subconscious for years. It’s how I’ve come to know about and come to terms with my experiences. The subconscious helps you to change the way you think; it can also promote personal growth and spirituality.</p><p>This blog goes into detail. Your intuition works with your subconscious. Once you’ve got the hang of tapping into and working with your intuition and you become more aware of your inner voice, or little whisper, you can start asking your subconscious questions; questions like… what is my subconscious mind trying to tell me? What is it trying to communicate?</p><p>More possible questions to ask your subconscious might be:</p><ul><li>What is my greatest fear or anxiety?</li><li>What is my deepest desire or passion?</li><li>What am I holding onto that is no longer serving me?</li><li>What am I avoiding or procrastinating about?</li></ul><p>The subconscious can help you to become aware through different signals such as:</p><ul><li>A feeling in your body, such as a tingling, a light or a heavy feeling</li><li>An image</li><li>An emotion</li><li>A thought</li><li>An image</li><li>A gesture</li><li>An impulse to do something</li><li>Involuntary muscle movement</li></ul><p>My subconscious helps me to become aware through an emotion, a heavy feeling, an inner thought, a feeling that produces an intention, an impulse to act on what my emotions are presenting me with. Intuition, often referred to as “gut feeling” or “sixth sense,” plays a significant role in shaping our decisions and actions.</p><p><b>Intuition is a powerful force</b></p><p>Intuition is a powerful force, as it allows us to make decisions and take actions that may not be immediately rational or logical, but based on a deep sense of knowing. It’s as if our intuition is whispering, guiding us towards a particular path or decision. We may not even realise the extent to which our intuition is influencing our decisions until we reflect on our experiences and realise just how often we’ve followed our gut instincts.</p><p><b>The subconscious mind’s crucial role</b></p><p>The subconscious mind plays a crucial role in helping us become aware of certain emotions, thoughts and feelings that can influence our intentions and impulses. It’s not just a random or fleeting idea, but rather a culmination of years of subconscious pattern recognition. This means that your intuition is often built on a foundation of past experiences, memories and learned behaviours that have been processed and stored in our subconscious mind.</p><p>The subconscious reflects how you feel about your relationships, and your experiences around those relationships, the good and bad. Those experiences are not something you should ignore.</p><p><b>Recognising the power of our intuition</b></p><p>By recognising the power of our intuition, we can tap into this silent yet potent force that guides our actions in everyday life. This can help us make more informed decisions, navigate uncertain situations, and respond to challenges with greater confidence and clarity.</p><p><b>Intuition — a ‘silent force’</b></p><p>The phrase “silent force” highlights the idea that our intuition may not always be loud or overt, but its impact can be profound. We may not even realise the extent to which our intuition is influencing our decisions until we reflect on our experiences and realise just how often we’ve followed our gut instincts.</p><p><b>You should trust your intuition</b></p><p>This statement encourages us to trust our intuition more, to listen to our inner voice — the voice that guides us. By acknowledging the power of our intuition, we can learn to tap into it more effectively and make more informed decisions that align with our values and goals.</p><p>I am reminded of the importance of tuning into my own intuition and trusting my inner wisdom. It is a valuable reminder that we all have this capacity within us, waiting to be accessed.</p><p><b>The Pendulum</b></p><p>The pendulum technique is a technique I use. It is a technique that has been used for centuries to tap into the subconscious mind and gain insight into various aspects of your life.</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of how it works:</p><p><b>The Pendulum: Bio-Feedback Mechanism</b></p><p>The pendulum is a simple, yet powerful tool that allows us to access our subconscious mind. The idea is that our subconscious mind is constantly sending out subtle signals, which are then picked up by our body. These signals are too small to be consciously detected, but they can be amplified and translated into a physical response.</p><p><b>How the ‘Pendulum’ Works</b></p><p>As you hold the pendulum, your subconscious mind sends out tiny, involuntary muscle movements to your hand. These micro-movements are so small that they’re imperceptible to our conscious mind. However, these subtle movements can cause the pendulum to swing or move in response to the subconscious signal.</p><p><b>The pendulum: No external force is required</b></p><p>Contrary to what you think or understand about the pendulum, no external force is required to move the pendulum. The movement is entirely due to the subtle interactions between your subconscious mind and the physical body.</p><p><b>No Voodoo or Magic</b></p><p>It is important to emphasise there is no magic or voodoo involved in using the pendulum. To recap, the pendulum is simply a tool that amplifies and translates the subconscious signals into a physical response.</p><p><b>Practical applications</b></p><p>The pendulum can be used for various purposes, such as:</p><ul><li>Gaining insight into a situation or problem</li><li>Answering questions or seeking guidance</li><li>Identifying patterns or connections</li><li>Detecting energies or vibrations</li><li>Facilitating meditation and introspection</li></ul><p><b>Tips and Precautions:</b></p><ul><li>Start with simple questions and gradually move on to more complex ones</li><li>You will need to keep your mind open and focused</li><li>Try to avoid influencing the pendulum with your conscious thoughts</li><li>Use a neutral or calm environment to minimise external distractions</li><li>Practice regularly to develop your skills and intuition.</li></ul><p>By understanding the bio-feedback mechanism behind pendulum dowsing, you can unlock its potential and use it as a powerful tool for personal growth, self-discovery and gaining insight into various aspects of life.</p><p>Intuition is often referred to as the “automatic” or “ unconscious” mind and it is estimated to process up to 90% of our thoughts and behaviours.</p><p>Here are a few ways it can impact our lives:</p><p><b>Pattern recognition</b></p><p>Our subconscious mind is wired to recognise patterns and make connections between seemingly unrelated events. This can lead to habitual thinking, emotional responses, or decision-making patterns that may not be in our best interests.</p><p><b>Emotional regulation</b></p><p>The subconscious mind is responsible for regulating our emotions, including fear, anxiety, and stress. These emotions can and often do influence our behaviour and decision-making without us even realising.</p><p><b>Memory consolidation</b></p><p>The subconscious mind is also responsible for consolidating memories and learning from past experiences. This can influence our behaviours, attitudes, and decisions without us consciously realising.</p><p><b>Automatic responses</b></p><p>The subconscious mind is responsible for automatic responses to certain stimuli, such as fear responses or knee-jerk reactions. These automatic responses can be triggered by subtle cues or stimuli without us even realising it.</p><p>The subconscious mind is the reason family feud, the reason politicians fall out, the reason wars are started. The subconscious mind is the part of the brain that stores painful memories, experiences. The part of the brain we fail to access, but the part of the brain that controls our presenting behaviour. It’s just about responsible for everything.</p><p>So, how can you check in with your subconscious mind and gain more control over your thoughts, behaviours and decisions?</p><p>Here are a few strategies:</p><p><b>Mindfulness</b></p><p>Mindfulness can help increase awareness of your thoughts and emotions, allowing you to better understand your subconscious mind.</p><p><b>Self-reflection</b></p><p>Regular self-reflection can help you identify patterns and habits in your behaviour and decision-making processes.</p><p><b>Journalling</b></p><p>Writing down (journalling) your thoughts and feelings can help you process your subconscious mind and gain insight into your past experiences, your motives and what you would like.</p><p><b>Seeking professional help</b></p><p>If you’re struggling with negative patterns or behaviours that seem to be driven by your subconscious mind, seeking help from a therapist or counsellor can be helpful. By checking in with our subconscious mind and gaining greater awareness of its role in shaping our lives, we can take control of our thoughts, behaviours and decisions, leading to greater self-awareness, personal growth, better decision-making and overall health and wellbeing.

By tuning in and listening to your inner voice, its whispers, you can gain insight into your experiences, including the good and the bad. It’s a way of dealing with and moving on from your past.</p><p>Receiving messages from your subconscious is also a powerful way to tap into your inner wisdom, creativity and intuition. The key is to practice working with your intuition.</p><p>Have you checked in with yours?</p><p>For more inspirational, lifestyle blogs, please check out my site <a href="https://www.thecpdiary.com">https://www.thecpdiary.com</a></p>
