The Heartbreaking Grief of Losing a Twin

<h1>The Heartbreaking Grief of Losing a Twin </h1><p>Since my twin died, I am altogether different. The heartbreaking grief of losing a twin is never ending; the shadows are constantly there, more than they were when my twin was here. I will write more. </p><p><b>The second born twin</b></p><p>Growing up the second born twin, I was always playing catch up. With a disability I didn&rsquo;t know I had, I relied on my twin more than I understood and that was difficult for her. We both wanted our independence. When we were born, twins shared their lives together. We had little choice; it&rsquo;s just how that went.  </p><p><b>A time to reflect</b><br/><br/>Now losing my twin is giving &lsquo;me time&rsquo; to reflect. I have clarity. Grief is difficult, the clarity isn&rsquo;t. Although we are separate now, spiritually we are as one.</p><p><b>I wasn&rsquo;t ready – I am not ready</b><br/><br/>Losing a twin, whether through separation or death, is unique and a challenging experience. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting what happened to happen, and therefore wasn&rsquo;t ready to let go. My twin&rsquo;s death has left me with a sense of gloom. Everything is changed. Through spiritual healing, I now have clarity. Life is a challenge without her.</p><p><b>Every day is a challenge</b></p><p>Every day has become a challenge; it&rsquo;s a challenge to keep going, to find hope, to feel better. Tinnitus from the stress of losing her, isn&rsquo;t helping.<br/><br/><b>A sense of foreboding</b></p><p>The family dynamics have changed. Where my twin once resided, and I could rely on her being there, I no longer have that. Instead the loss is great and I am left with a sense of foreboding. Like all relationships, our relationship wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but when the chips were down, we were there for each other.</p><p><b>Spiritual Healing</b></p><p>None of it is good. Caught off guard I am still processing. I’ve turned to spiritual healing to find some clarity and a sense of purpose. I know that having a sense of clarity can be empowering, especially being faced with such a profound loss. Life is not the same. The twin bond cannot be replaced. However, it&rsquo;s important for me to recognise that my twin&rsquo;s memory and spirit will continue to live on within me.</p><p><b>My health has changed</b><br/><br/>I know my twin is well again, my wellness isn&rsquo;t what it was. Losing her became the catalyst of my own health struggles. Now she&rsquo;s gone, all I have are the memories of a life with my twin and my sense of foreboding goes on, until I am able to carve out a new life away from my old life.</p><p>That&rsquo;s going to take time.</p><p>For more inspirational, lifestyle blogs, please check out my site <a href="https://www.thecpdiary.com">https://www.thecpdiary.com</a></p>
