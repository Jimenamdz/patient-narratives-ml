<p class="npf_chat"><b>It’s hard not to be pissed off and resentful toward the world. I have to see everyone else living their lives happily and going places and doing all of this fun stuff as I sit idly by. My fiancé was diagnosed in April with Stage 2 Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma. It is a rare, and aggressive cancer and treatment is done aggressively. On top of the numerous appointments, two painful biopsies, and a painful “port” procedure in her chest…she starts chemotherapy next week. That entails 5 days straight of chemotherapy, each month, for the next 6 months. So that means every first 5 days of every month going forward, she will be stuck in the hospital getting treatment. Studies show it is curable and it responds well to treatment, but my heart is broken for her, and I am finding it hard to be strong. How do I continue to find the right words to say? She’s going to lose her hair most likely, and that’s totally ok by me, but I know she’s devastated. I wish more than anything that I could trade places with her. I feel so bad and I am finding it hard to manage my own mental health and the nightmare has only begun. Is there anyone out there who can relate? Any helpful advice? Anything? I’ve come too far in my life and my struggles and my faith journey to be set back from this. I am trying, I really am. Fuck cancer…fuck it 🖕🏻</b></p><figure data-tumblr-attribution="forest-illusions:4L691P56GOQxNL3_ZUUuYQ:ZFdgvc2YFrNq4" data-orig-height="263" data-orig-width="245"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a486e57143f2071eec0e9888783a27bb/b993ae91d5059473-02/s640x960/c3007a6e26d76347cc8c084174effb550ccd9917.gif" data-orig-height="263" data-orig-width="245" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a486e57143f2071eec0e9888783a27bb/b993ae91d5059473-02/s75x75_c1/448733adb1dab050ffd20c11b9d808ac27c5ee75.gif 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a486e57143f2071eec0e9888783a27bb/b993ae91d5059473-02/s100x200/af919d2cd44eba4d7b40f908c346eff56747903d.gif 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a486e57143f2071eec0e9888783a27bb/b993ae91d5059473-02/s250x400/f671d09941b0b7b97e0294e60b2be4e573a0ec7a.gif 245w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px"/></figure>
