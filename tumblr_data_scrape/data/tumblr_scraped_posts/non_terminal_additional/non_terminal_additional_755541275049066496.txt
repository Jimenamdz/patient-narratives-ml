We know multiple people complained he was a cheat.  It&rsquo;s entirely possible they were right.  It&rsquo;s also entirely possible that he kept these complaint letters as records of people he would no longer do business with, because they had made accusations and threats in order to bully him into giving them free copper.  That is an equally valid interpretation of the evidence.</p><p>My point is not that we have maligned Ea-Nasir, my point is that thousands of years later, we do not and cannot know.</p></blockquote>
