Speaking for a good cause

<h1>Speaking for a good cause</h1><p>Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to speak at the Hilton Hotel for the Cancer Council. As a cancer survivor myself, I have long been a supporter of the amazing work that the Cancer Council does to support, research, educate and assist people with Cancer.</p><p>I presented a maritime history talk about the <i>RMS Titanic</i> to the <a href="https://cancerwa.asn.au/get-involved/leave-a-gift-in-your-will/clive-deverall-society/" target="_blank">Cancer Council&rsquo;s Clive Deverall Society</a>. Society members are very special supporters of the Cancer Council, who have committed to leaving a bequest to support those affected by Cancer. </p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1152" data-orig-width="1125"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/11101e3c76211e5ef5c5527d6168d9a7/14d22a34d8674cb1-55/s640x960/a73997827cc1792b0fd5f7869ea2e3195248aca6.jpg" data-orig-height="1152" data-orig-width="1125" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/11101e3c76211e5ef5c5527d6168d9a7/14d22a34d8674cb1-55/s75x75_c1/2c2feb9bd7655949dfbea7dc866526fd416c561f.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/11101e3c76211e5ef5c5527d6168d9a7/14d22a34d8674cb1-55/s100x200/b0c70b083f2109fcc6395b5166b482a49d44dea5.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/11101e3c76211e5ef5c5527d6168d9a7/14d22a34d8674cb1-55/s250x400/dfd99db47545ecab23ed10182200841fa6c1835a.jpg 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/11101e3c76211e5ef5c5527d6168d9a7/14d22a34d8674cb1-55/s400x600/b1a66846dce2930841a46565d50ccee55031c734.jpg 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/11101e3c76211e5ef5c5527d6168d9a7/14d22a34d8674cb1-55/s500x750/8d2a918a3e8d2cb46b9ea3da350ee5eeb05092d9.jpg 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/11101e3c76211e5ef5c5527d6168d9a7/14d22a34d8674cb1-55/s540x810/a635297592498897f2e893bc3a740364db919f2d.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/11101e3c76211e5ef5c5527d6168d9a7/14d22a34d8674cb1-55/s640x960/a73997827cc1792b0fd5f7869ea2e3195248aca6.jpg 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/11101e3c76211e5ef5c5527d6168d9a7/14d22a34d8674cb1-55/s1280x1920/7f8a3b0f9462f75e6b1e2e90f88308752f1b6977.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px"/></figure></div><p><i>Above: Ashley Reid, Cancer Council CEO and Chris Frame.</i></p><p>The society is named in honour Clive Deverall, who guided the Cancer Council in WA for almost 25 years.
