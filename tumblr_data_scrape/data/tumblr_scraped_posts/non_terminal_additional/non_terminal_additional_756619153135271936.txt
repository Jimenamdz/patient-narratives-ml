Members Supporting Jimin and his phenomenal success of MUSE

<h1><span class="npf_color_chandler">Members Supporting Jimin and his phenomenal success of MUSE</span></h1><p>I will equivocally state that I am a jikooker with Jimin as my bias, but I support ALL members with my money (buying albums, digital downloads, merch, fan club, concerts) and time (streaming, blogs, IG, TikTok).</p><p>But, i don’t understand for the life of me the antics of one member. This is Jimin’s promotional weekend and there has not been one ounce of support for Jimin and his album release from Taehyung. Yet most of the other members (Suga does not promote while enlisted) have congratulated JM and shown their support. I expect to see a tiktok post from JK soon, as he did for Hobi and RM. </p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="527" data-orig-width="1330"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s640x960/f508c7a19a8f8b363c92e16fda12718c95a05f6c.jpg" data-orig-height="527" data-orig-width="1330" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s75x75_c1/b0769822dd29925ce42e355e5073d2143268b063.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s100x200/005a6b636584d107c3071e1cd6ed1e3df41dd3c2.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s250x400/2ca35aa08ca1f9c12bc6d5e273be1675608f7ebb.jpg 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s400x600/31964db06fc8304f6dccad7e47821b36dda3e321.jpg 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s500x750/9422acd6dc0420ebe522dc3d95d1d4726ad060b0.jpg 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s540x810/abaeda2eea1877fabadd30b640a473bb06c50c03.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s640x960/f508c7a19a8f8b363c92e16fda12718c95a05f6c.jpg 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s1280x1920/1451ea0293a431d90f575b3c35647d4f0734c8be.jpg 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95790f064bbed97486b97b464663874/7da52a78fd9e9661-b0/s2048x3072/02b545e5ed40ff2ba9c2b5695e770afd94db7fe4.jpg 1330w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><p>But why has Tae not supported this album release of Muse just like he never supported FACE? What he does instead is release a promo for his photo book during Jimin’s promo period. Actually, i was ok with it, because it was not music, but a personal photo project I saw as a gift to Army on Army day. </p><p>But today, in the middle of tracking and charting for Jimin, along with the trailer for JM/JK travel show releasing later today, he decides to post a photo of him and JK in Hawaii stating: JK will come quickly because he asked him to and missed him. <span class="npf_color_joey"><b>What was the point of this post?</b></span> Why is he feeding the taekookers who have been dragging Jimin relentlessly since the announcement of the travel show and the drop of his album. A large group of people who are actively working against Jimin by supporting other acts just to try and hold back Jimin. Mind you, JK is not getting the hate.</p><p>I am not saying a member has to publish on social media to show support, but he did for other members and never for Jimin. That whole show where they hugged each other on Jin’s discharge was very touching, but now feels so disingenuous.</p><p>Help me understand what is going on and why this seems to continually happen. Last year, JK would come back and provide context to everything that Tae said that put taekookers on a roll. Like Jimin, he has pretty much been absent from social medial and can’t do lives. </p><p>Do I believe, they are all friends? Yes! But are they all as close to each equally, obviously not and that is understandable.  Tae is closer to his wooga squad than he is most of the members of BTS. But even taking the whole shipping aspect away from jikook, i would still feel Tae’s actions should be questioned, simply because what he does over and over again is to rile up the toxic members of his fanbase and taekookers to hate on Jimin. We saw how bad it got last year with the death threats and reports to the Ministry of Defense from JK solos and taekookers. It is bad now with Jimin’s album release and travel show with JK.</p><p>What does it take to be supportive like the other members or just simply be quiet this weekend?</p><p>This is not a hate post towards Tae, but a post calling out a behavior that has negative connotations towards Jimin, his supposed soulmate.</p><p>Bottom Line - STREAM, STREAM, STREAM FOR JIMIN LIKE THERE IS NO TOMORROW!!</p>
