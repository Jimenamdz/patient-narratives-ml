His voice is so light and airy. Sets the perfect tone of what he&rsquo;s trying to convey in the album. I get why this is one of his favorite tracks.</p><p>WITH YOU WITH YOU WITH YOU - love this part</p><p><b><span class="npf_color_monica">Showtime</span></b> acts like a seamless transition to SGMB tho. Could easily be the soundtrack of a little scene on some adventure movie, his voice at the end is so cute. I&rsquo;m glad he had so much fun!</p><p><b><span class="npf_color_ross">SGMB</span></b> - honestly this song is truly just so postive. No matter what your musical preferences are, this song is what he wants to portray in all his happy bubbly self. It truly is a different from the rest type of track. I could tell he was so proud and loved the add-libs he did throughout the song.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel"><b>Slow dance</b></span><b> -</b> I JUST KNEW their voices together would go super well on this track, she just has that type of specific voice that blends so well with jimins. The way for a moment I couldn&rsquo;t distinguish the voices at the end.. I WAS WAITING like my life depended on it for the saxophone part, wish it was even longer</p><p><span class="npf_color_chandler"><b>Be Mine</b></span> - It should be illegal to go this hard on a song, It is simply not allowed. You can tell he was waiting for his little latin moment again. This really is such a good genre for him. </p><p>MOVIN COMIN LOVIN in a hot island huh jimin? so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening huh? ðŸ˜†</p><p><b><span class="npf_color_niles">WHO</span></b> - SOTY. Yes he&rsquo;s put crack on this because I can&rsquo;t seem to stop listening (in a strategic way with playlists, pls stream lol)</p><p><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/thoughtsonkm/756440191072387072/soty-soty-soty-noo-i-am-gagged-speechless?source=share">additional thoughts on this previous post</a></p><p><span class="npf_color_joey"><b>Closer than this</b></span> is just e mental loop of  I CAN NEVER LET YOU GOOO O O O OOOOO, can&rsquo;t help it </p><p><b><small>I&rsquo;m so proud of him for continuing to elevate his music and art and also for always delivering bops and never disappointing </small></b></p><p><small><b>I&rsquo;m proud he was able to do 2 albums back to back and that he no longer beats himself up for mistakes he thinks he makes and also that he finally could do the voice training from scratch just as he&rsquo;s been wanting to for years, to keep his voice healthy and ensure longevity </b></small></p></blockquote>
