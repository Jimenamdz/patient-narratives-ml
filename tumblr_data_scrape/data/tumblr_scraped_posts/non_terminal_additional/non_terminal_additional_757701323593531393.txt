Why Costa Olympia became Norwegian Sky

<h1>Why Costa Olympia became Norwegian Sky</h1><p>Norwegian Cruise Line’s Norwegian Sky was ordered - and partially built - to be a Costa Cruises ship - expected to be called Costa Olympia! </p><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="youtube" data-url="https://youtu.be/0MTrUukzlYQ" data-orig-width="356" data-orig-height="200"><iframe width="356" height="200" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0MTrUukzlYQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="Costa's Castoff - How Costa Olympia became Norwegian Sky!"></iframe></figure><p>Costa Cruises was expanding its fleet in the 1990s, and the introduction of the Costa Victoria in 1996 brought in an array of new amenities for the brand. </p><p>Costa Victoria was built at Bremer Vulcan yard in Germany. At 75,166gt, the ship featured large public spaces, multiple balcony cabins and a large on deck entertainment zone to their shipboard amenities. </p><p>The ship was the first in the Victoria-class, and was expected to have a sister ship, named Costa Olympia. </p><p>Costa Olympia was laid down at the same German shipyard, but while the ship was being built the shipyard went bankrupt. This threw the building of Costa Olympia into disarray, which was only 35% complete at the time! </p><p>What was built was launched in October 1996 - to clear the slipway - and Costa Olympia’s incomplete hull was immediately laid up for long term storage. </p><p>The ongoing shipyard issues led Costa to abandon their plans to take delivery of Costa Olympia. </p><h2>Becoming Norwegian Sky: </h2><p>The 1990s saw Norwegian Cruise Line implement growth plans of their own. </p><p>NCL purchased Costa Olympia’s incomplete hull in 1997 and had it towed to the Lloyd Werft Yard in Bremerhaven, Germany, in early 1998. </p><p>What had already been built was incorporated into a modified design, with design works overseen by the same firm that had been working on Costa Olympia. </p><p>The ship was ultimately launched as Norwegian Sky. </p><p>Bigger than Costa Victoria, the 78,309gt ship entered service for NCL in 1999. The design was considered to be successful enough to warrant NCL to order two additional ships in the class. </p><p>The second NCL vessel was launched as Norwegian Sun. NCL’s third order was ultimately cancelled. </p><p>With Costa Victoria now scrapped, only Norwegian Sky and Norwegian Sun remain, but continue as popular members of the NCL fleet. </p>
