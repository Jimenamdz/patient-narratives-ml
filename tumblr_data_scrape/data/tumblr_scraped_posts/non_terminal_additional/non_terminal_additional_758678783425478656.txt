I think she&rsquo;d be really surprised and shocked by how many people have reached out and said really beautiful things about her. </i><b><i>It&rsquo;s just a testament to who she was as a person.</i></b></p></blockquote><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><i>I&rsquo;m angry and I&rsquo;m sad she doesn&rsquo;t get to see the places that she wanted to. And I&rsquo;m angry and sad that once again I&rsquo;ve lost, you know, that person that you can call in the middle of the night, to cancer. I&rsquo;ve lost another friend to cancer. And it&rsquo;s really hard when you lose someone who should have and really wanted to live along in full life, not just for herself, but for other people in her family. You know, when I went through tough times in my life, some really horrible stuff, and one day I showed up on her door step, and I didn&rsquo;t know how bad I looked physically until I saw it on her face, and I saw her face change, and I knew I must have been pretty beat up. To her credit, she never shied away, she never took a step back, and if something was wrong, she went full end to help me fix it. And I think that&rsquo;s because she had seen so much pain and trauma in her own life that she didn&rsquo;t want to see anybody else go through it. And whether it was me or my kids. She was literally always a phone call away.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><i>It&rsquo;s so unbelievable that, even knowing she was sick, </i><b><i>we just thought we had more time.</i></b><i> And she definitely did think she had more time. So I guess for me, that&rsquo;s the lesson is that you think you have time, but you don&rsquo;t. And not many people could do what Shannen did in one day. </i><b><i>She was just like a tornado of energy. </i></b><i>But I think that&rsquo;s the thing to take away from all of this is you think you have time, and so you know, she would give me an awful hard time that I don&rsquo;t say I love you enough. To anyone. It&rsquo;s not on a like you know, personal oasis, but to anyone in general. And so I would say, you know,</i><b><i> tell the people you love that you love and live like there is no tomorrow</i></b><i>, because that&rsquo;s what she did.</i></p></blockquote><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="930" data-orig-width="1500"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s640x960/71fd08c6fa7e901a678db8343999c161a0eaf046.jpg" data-orig-height="930" data-orig-width="1500" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s75x75_c1/2bdeae6a84d748bb7dfa0067e25715715fa992c7.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s100x200/d0098d5750801b838797bd8580aa37ea33558f9e.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s250x400/077e9a2cfc8d4303a021a0d9f289125e1b49f8d4.jpg 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s400x600/c3c8213667837821dea0c40a8db45de4712e2096.jpg 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s500x750/78f491ddd46eee435213ca915db35dec4e775286.jpg 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s540x810/3de22e0ba64aa85db93d1d70e67335e4aad14077.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s640x960/71fd08c6fa7e901a678db8343999c161a0eaf046.jpg 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s1280x1920/fd498e6991e77ebacb15f873376722b687dd1324.jpg 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c9a9ba5e086ad2c2e81e65562eb0827/2aa69ca9f5cd22cb-af/s2048x3072/3173674ad76be3f14f030b9e51d66c839e9fcc8a.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><h2><b>Brian Krause:</b></h2><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><i>When I got on the show Charmed, I was really nervous to show up and perform in front of her.

If it weren&rsquo;t for Shannen, I would not be who I am in so many more ways than one. I had the good fortune of being cast on the spin off series of &ldquo;90210&rdquo; in 2008, playing the character Annie Wilson, who was part of the brother&rsquo;s sister duo that moved from a small town to Beverly Hills. And the only reason why that happened is because </i><b><i>Shannen Doherty created one of the most iconic characters ever to be on television</i></b><i> in my opinion, and I think a lot of people would agree with me on that one. Shannen Doherty created </i><b><i>the character that we all fell in love with.</i></b></p></blockquote><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><b><i>I had the incredible fortune of stepping into a tiny version of her shoes</i></b><i> and hopefully follow into her footsteps in a way that made Shannen proud. Because </i><b><i>Shannen was so warm and so lovely and so fiercely strong and unapologetic, and she is the type of woman that I have always aspired to be. And it was watching her do it despite everything that she was met with and continue to forge ahead, being true to who she was that gave me the confidence to do the same</i></b><i>, no matter how much resistance I&rsquo;ve been met with throughout my life. Because of that, and there, I&rsquo;ve said it before, </i><b><i>there&rsquo;s really not been much of a blueprint for how to be a strong, unapologeticly strong woman in a world and society that is so determined to tell you not to. But she did</i></b><i> it. She did it, and she, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, is one of the very few that is the blueprint. </i><b><i>It&rsquo;s women like Shannen Doherty that give the rest of us permission and confidence to demand what we deserve, stand up for ourselves, and not take any shit</i></b><i>. And I hope I&rsquo;m allowed to say that, but I think Shannen would be okay with it. In my short time of getting the job on &ldquo;90210&rdquo; and starting to film and </i><b><i>being a part of the tabloid fodder and media craze that was at that time, it was only a little why into that process and that experience that I met Shannen </i></b><i>and had the privilege to actually work with her portraying the character of Brenda alongside me on &ldquo;90210&rdquo;. </i><b><i>And at that point, already in just a short window of time, I had been so mentally broken down by the experience. </i></b><i>You know, I was eighteen when I moved out to La to take on the job. I was by myself, left my family back home, really didn&rsquo;t know anybody other than my cast. And the behind the scenes drama that &ldquo;Beverly Hills, 90210&rdquo; was known for definitely was recreated behind the scenes of our spinoff of &ldquo;90210&rdquo; as well. And I think Shannen and I am not having ever spoken about it, but I think a lot of our experiences, or the experiences I had, mirrored a lot of the experiences that she had.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><b><i>Meeting her that day in the trailer, I was so exciting because she was my favorite character from the original show. </i></b><i>I had watched it with my mom growing up, so I was a super fan of her already, and I think, you know, brown hair like, she was the gorgeous brunette for the show, so I felt most like tied to her, and </i><b><i>I was so nervous meeting her, and she literally just like welcomed me into her trailer with the biggest smile and the warmest hug, </i></b><i>and it was like I don&rsquo;t even know if she meant to communicate this with her hug, but </i><b><i>it made me feel so seen and like I was not alone </i></b><i>in everything that I was experiencing at that time, because it was a lot.
