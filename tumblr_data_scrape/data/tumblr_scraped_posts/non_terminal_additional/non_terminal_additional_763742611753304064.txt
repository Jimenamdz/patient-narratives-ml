As an acespec person with ace friends I definitely see us get infantilised and tiptoed around during conversations about sex, and ace fictional characters getting stereotyped as innocent and “pure”, which really shows gross misunderstanding of the ace spectrum and makes it seem like there’s only one way to be ace. </p><p>I love that Isaac wasn’t just included in the conversations about sex, he actively asked questions and contributed advice to Charlie, and his and Tao’s opinions were treated with equal validity. I love seeing ace people being portrayed as educated and knowledgeable about sex despite not being interested in participating. Isaac just makes me feel so seen. Heartstopper has some of the best ace rep out there in my opinion (though the pool is pretty limited). </p></blockquote>
