Or aim it away. You can perform this action without taking your eyes off the road, simply by grabbing the appropriate vent.</p><p>In a Tesla:</p><ol><li>Find &amp; touch the climate control button on the touch screen</li><li>Find &amp; touch the <i>image of the vent</i> you want to control on the touch screen</li><li>Pinch and expand to increase</li><li>Pinch and squeeze to decrease</li><li>Swipe to aim left/right, up/down</li></ol><p>All of this while trying to keep your vehicle on the road. Good luck with that! </p><p>Note that the whole time your fingers only touch glass, not physical switches. There is no feedback, haptics, no way to feel if you&rsquo;re touching the right thing. It&rsquo;s all done visually.</p><p>And every time Tesla issues an over-the-air software update, the screens could change, rearranging things while you sleep. That usually <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> happen, but the very nature of software means that it could. Unlike a physical switch jammed into your old car&rsquo;s dashboard.</p><p>It&rsquo;s such a dangerous situation that the EU has changed the rules about how they certify automobile safety. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091043/euro-ncap-safety-rating-europe-2026-touchscreen-buttons-dials">Cars without physical switches can no longer receive a top safety rating</a>.</p></blockquote>
