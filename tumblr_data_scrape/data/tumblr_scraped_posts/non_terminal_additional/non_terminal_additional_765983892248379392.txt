The neighbor who has two children who identify somewhere on the Rainbow and an ex-husband who is the only reason they have insurance.</p><p>“Who would I even vote for,” she says, exasperated, which I find very funny because her partner is a former cop teaching high schoolers how to be a cop. Before her disability Neighbor was a jail guard. They have a wooden American flag in the living room. Their daughter is not allowed out of the house alone because girls are victims in waiting. The guy who ought to be in prison for hurting girls and inciting an attack on the capitol vs the woman who’s actually helped the system seems like a no-brainer? Is the cop training really that hard to overcome?</p><p>“Not trump. <i>Literally just not trump</i>, since he has done nothing but try to kill people like you and me and our kids? That seems maybe bad to put back in power.”</p><p>“Oh,” says the woman who fits several profiles the republicans are loudly declaring an intent to eradicate. “I guess I hadn’t thought about that.”</p><p><br/></p><p><i>What the fuck</i> have you been thinking about then? How much you don’t want a black woman in the White House?</p><p><br/></p><p>PLEASE. PLEASE vote. Every single ballot is important.</p><p><br/></p><p>I’m gonna end up hibernating so hard for the next few days, my heart cannot take this again.</p></blockquote>
