everyone says join your local mutual aid groups and build community, but uh, what do you do if a lot of them seem to have...

That means you may need to be the one to start it. Someone has to.</li><li><b>Your presence will matter. </b>Local community networks are SMALL. That means that every single person has an outsized presence and an outsized absence. One person dropping off the map can feel catastrophic, but that also means that one person stepping up can make all the difference.</li><li><b>Find a center. </b>Any community group needs a steady base. That can be a physical location - that&rsquo;s why coffeehouses were historically such effective grounds for building political and creative movements. It can also be a person or people who are consistent and reliable. If one person shows up to make space for work on a regular basis, they&rsquo;ll be there when the second person shows up. They&rsquo;ll be there for the third. That&rsquo;s how it starts.</li><li><b>Play secretary.</b> A lot of activist groups are starving for some basic admin support. Maybe you&rsquo;re not up for being the leader, but maybe you can organize the Google drive. Maybe you can be the one that keeps phone numbers. There&rsquo;s a lot of unsexy shit work out there that needs to be done.</li><li><b>Count your eggs before you start baking.</b> There is an economics of labor to why activism circles have shrunk. Be mindful of the time and hands you have available when deciding what work you&rsquo;re able to take on.</li><li><b>Build tolerance, build coalitions.</b> Small organizing means you can&rsquo;t afford to fracture over every little disagreement. Decide your mission and your values from the start, the things that are non-negotiable, and don&rsquo;t get hung up on the rest. Be prepared to work with people you don&rsquo;t like. Focus on the task at hand.</li><li><b>Network!</b> Know what other related or like-minded projects are out there, whether they are groups like yours in other areas or groups in your community who are doing work that intersects with yours.</li><li><b>Be there for people.</b> Step up. Offer to help. Even outside an organizing structure, if you become the kind of person who shows up and helps, people will remember you and they will reach out to you when need arises.</li></ol></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;ve spent any time organizing, you&rsquo;ll know numbers 4 and 5 <i>cannot</i> be overstated. Number 5 is the biggest reason organizing groups don&rsquo;t stick around. Organizing is work. You&rsquo;re asking people to do a job outside of their job. It&rsquo;s important to commit to WAY LESS than you want to. It&rsquo;s also SO important that someone is the documentarian. This is why a lot of the work doesn&rsquo;t get passed on when the initial group of folks burns out. </p><p>These points are also good litmus tests if you&rsquo;re looking to join a group. If they&rsquo;re committing to a lot, and expect a lot from you, try setting some clear boundaries about what you can do sustainably. If there&rsquo;s major push back and/or shaming for suggesting to do less&hellip;RUN. That group will burn you out SO quick. Similarly if they don&rsquo;t have any documentation then they haven&rsquo;t paused to do the boring structural work that is necessary to keep a group going. </p></blockquote><p>The thing about requests to &ldquo;get involved&rdquo; and &ldquo;stay engaged&rdquo; is, they don&rsquo;t often really tell you <i>how </i>to do that. And, as OP points out, even if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to live in a place where there&rsquo;s some community infrastructure already in place (like mutual aid groups) these are often small, disorganized, or out of energy. </p><p>And that&rsquo;s because <b>community organizing is a skill</b>! It&rsquo;s not a skill many of us have, and it&rsquo;s not a skill most of us are taught—but it&rsquo;s a skill you can learn like any other. There&rsquo;s an <a href="https://wagingnonviolence.org/2024/11/10-things-to-do-if-trump-wins/">excellent article going around</a> by Daniel Hunter that gives you a really quick intro to some of the ways organizers think—it&rsquo;s strategic, practical, and goal-oriented. Marshall Ganz and the <a href="https://leadingchangenetwork.org/resource-center/">Leading Change Network</a> is another excellent resource. (For those of you who remember Howard Dean&rsquo;s primary campaign in &lsquo;04, and its commitment to grass-roots/community-based organizing and small-dollar fundraising—it was rooted in Ganz&rsquo;s work. And yes, I worked that campaign, mumblety-many years ago.) </p><p>I grew up with parents who were politically active and politically engaged—we talked politics, and we did (do!)  things like go to marches, sign petitions, and go to rallies. My dad took me to my first (and second, and third) anti-war rally during the Bush years. But as I&rsquo;ve gotten older, I&rsquo;ve learned that the kind of political engagement they taught me <i>is </i>important—but it isn&rsquo;t really about <b>getting things done</b>. That&rsquo;s community organizing. </p><p>I&rsquo;m still a neophyte at community organizing. It&rsquo;s okay if you are too! Many of us weren&rsquo;t taught it, but it&rsquo;s a skill that can be learned. </p><p><a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/MPjMtDn7gFo84mMQGzO2gtA">@ptolemaeacas</a>, If you&rsquo;re trying to find a way to &ldquo;get involved&rdquo; or find a mutual aid group but are struggling: the above commentary is excellent once you&rsquo;ve found a group. If the question really is how to find a group—well, that&rsquo;s a tough one! If you live in a bigger city, you can probably find some good starting points by googling &ldquo;community organizing NYC&rdquo; (or whatever). You also might check out the organizations on <a href="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*5s6Bn1lRU18kAwXwYgr2FQ.png">this list</a> (sorry it&rsquo;s a picture and not text—it&rsquo;s from the former organizing arm of the Obama campaign) to see if they have any local chapters near you. If you&rsquo;re in a small town (as I am) you might need to be more issue-focused. My town has a social services coordinator, and there&rsquo;s a food-and-fuel fund for lower-income residents; see if your town has similar organizations and talk to the leaders. </p><p>And—one more thing, if you&rsquo;ll forgive the aside. You don&rsquo;t have to do everything. If what you really care about is press freedom—or immigrant rights—or defending the separation of church and state—or climate action—or anti-racism activism—or union organizing—it&rsquo;s okay to channel your energies towards just one cause. There&rsquo;s a lot of work that&rsquo;ll need to be done over the next four years.  As <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/Mt2kr7_KskWgui7u_FXmANw">@fruityshirts</a> notes, burnout is a real risk. Trust that you don&rsquo;t have to do it all. Find your niche, and other people will find theirs.</p></blockquote>
