You just want enough for the dough to stick together. If you like a lot of topping you can make 1.5x as much and it&rsquo;ll be fine. Drop it in grape-sized clumps on top of the fruit. Dust with about 1t sugar. Put it in the oven at 350F until the top is golden-brown. </p><p>This is a good basic cobbler recipe and you can change it up however you want. Different fruit, spices, whatever. I am about to make a version that has cocoa powder in the topping &amp; dark chocolate chips mixed in with the strawberry filling, and I will feel like a rich motherfucker when it&rsquo;s done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Egg glurp:</p><p>Eggs noodles, can of tuna, can of cream of mushroom soup, hard boiled eggs. Cook noodles, drain, add the rest and stir together.</p><p>Simple. Cheap. Warm and yummy. </p><p>(Also very plain. I didn&rsquo;t learn how to use spices other than salt and pepper until I met my spouse who grew up in SoCal.) </p>
