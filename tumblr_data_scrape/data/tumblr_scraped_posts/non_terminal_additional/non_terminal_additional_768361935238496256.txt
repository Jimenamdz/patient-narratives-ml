Yep! Read on. :)</h1><p>After the success of our June/Pride 2024 sales goal, where we managed to eliminate a lot of the debt we accumulated while I was unable to work earlier this year &amp; stock up cash so we didn&rsquo;t have to borrow for payroll during the fall lull and also donate to <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/M8gCDswsqv7sFYj0ROH2hJw">@queerliblib</a>, we were considering where to focus on this year when a conversation I had with my mom pointed me in the direction of our charity for Holidays 2024: the <b><a href="https://www.esu.edu/food_pantry/index.cfm">East Stroudsburg University Warrior Food Pantry</a>, </b>and specifically, <b>stocking menstrual products at the pantry</b>. </p><p>Without getting too much into the weeds about the details - which I&rsquo;ll talk about under the cut for those of you who are interested - here&rsquo;s the pitch: <b><span class="npf_color_chandler">we need to hit a gross sales goal of $45K in December in order to pay our bills and payroll basically until Pride starts up</span></b>. Businesses like ours are very much feast or famine, and we&rsquo;ve got to eat and we&rsquo;ve got people whose paychecks depend on us having the cash to pay them. </p><p><b><span class="npf_color_chandler">If we hit that goal, we&rsquo;ll donate the equivalent of 1% of our net profit from the month of December in period products </span></b>&ndash; tampons and pads, specifically, by request of the food pantry, and possibly reusable pads and menstrual cups, if the pantry wants that from us. (At the end of the day, this is about taking care of people the way they need, and we&rsquo;ll listen to the pantry staff about what people are requesting.)</p><p>We&rsquo;ve currently got our Bottoms &amp; Tops sale going, too, so you can <b><span class="npf_color_chandler">buy 2 tops or bottoms from the linked collection &amp; get 69% off the 3rd item from that collection. </span></b></p><p class="npf_link" data-npf="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nerdykeppie.com/collections/holiday-bottoms-tops-sale&quot;,&quot;display_url&quot;:&quot;https://nerdykeppie.com/collections/holiday-bottoms-tops-sale&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bottoms &amp; Tops Sale!&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;IT'S BACK!

ESU is a state school, and as such is one of the few remaining vaguely affordable schools in Pennsylvania. A <i>lot </i>of its students are self-supporting for one reason or another &ndash; many are &ldquo;non-traditional&rdquo;/adult students, have kids, or don&rsquo;t have families that can support them while they go to school. Mom &amp; Dad have pushed to expand what the food pantry offers to personal care items, which has been difficult due to a bunch of boring stuff about money and state entities and also people thinking &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not food,&rsquo; but Mom is stubborn about it, because &ndash; to paraphrase her &ndash; <i>how can you focus on class when you feel gross?</i> This struggle has been especially difficult for menstrual products, and way more so for tampons, because it&rsquo;s a rather conservative area and&hellip; yeah. People get weird about it. </p><p>I&rsquo;ve been really broke, with a young kid, and reliant on food pantries, which rarely, if ever, have any menstrual products, let alone tampons. Period poverty is very real, and it sucks. </p><p>Plus, I gotta tell you, if we can send a bunch of boxes of tampons and pads to the food pantry, well&hellip; <i>Rumor has it </i>this will help my mom win an argument over whether those items should be carried at all, because what are they gonna do, throw them out? They&rsquo;re here! They&rsquo;ve been donated! Wasting them would be terrible. :)</p><p>So that&rsquo;s the pitch, guys. <b>Help me make a direct, measurable difference</b> in the lives of people at the school where I went to winter swim team, the school that fed me growing up&hellip; <i><b>and </b></i>help my mom win an argument about making people&rsquo;s lives better&hellip; <i><b>and </b></i>get your holiday shopping done while you do. ;) We start counting sales from the minute I hit post. :P </p></blockquote>
