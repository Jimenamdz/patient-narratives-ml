"Come on, motherfucker, you survived, you gotta give yourself a break"

<h1>&ldquo;Come on, motherfucker, you survived, you gotta give yourself a break&rdquo;</h1><p>That lyrics from Everybody Lost Somebody by Bleachers has been stuck in my head for a while now. Almost got it made into a wooden plague before I remembered my finances.</p><p>On February 9, 2024, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin lymphoma after suffering with symptoms and misdiagnoses for over a year prior. And on November 4, 2024, I was declared to be in remission.</p><p>The entire process was hell. Every two weeks, I would go in for an infusion of nivo+AVD for two and a half hours, followed by five days of dealing with poison. The body pain, the nausea, the weight gain, the fatigue, the cognitive decline. I hated it all. For a while, I was mentally okay as I just had to focus on getting through chemo week. But the monster of self-doubt and self-loathing mixed with the stress of the ordeal. Was I even really suffering? I only had Hodgkin lymphoma, one of the most treatable cancers where I live. And I was on immunotherapy plus chemotherapy, a less severe alternative to straight chemo. And I lived an unhealthy life. So maybe I deserved it. Maybe I deserved cancer.</p><p>Evil fucking thoughts in an evil fucking time. Shit that I am ashamed to admit. Shit that I am scared to share with people. But they were mine, and it made an already soul-scathing year even more relentless.</p><p>So here I am in survivorhood. People have told me that survivorship is not the end of it all and now I fully understand what they mean. The fear of relapse, how every symptom could be a sign of recurrence. The grief of losing almost a year of my life to cancer, not to mention the other health issues treatment has brought about. The burden of those around me knowing what I am now, the feeling that they feel I am no longer capable of much. The knowledge that they are right.  I am fatter and dumber than ever and I have so much shame and self-hatred around all of it. And why I quoted that song in the title: the feeling that I should and need to just move on and be normal.</p><p>I am still unemployed. I am still poor. I am still in massive debt. I am still professionally pathetic. Nothing stopped when I got my diagnosis and treatment. I initially took my remission as the permission to live normally, but I can&rsquo;t get back to that normal. I am not the same person I was a year ago. I have trauma, I have fear, I have limits. I&rsquo;m slower in every sense, less capable, and now less forgivable. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what it would mean to process things or get better. I have spent too long looking up ways to get my brain back only to not remember or stick to any of it. I incorporate workouts and diets only to struggle with losing the massive weight I gained in just one year. </p><p>But I need to be normal, or at least act it. I need to be capable. I need to get a job. I need to get smarter. I need to be reliable again. I need to be respectable again. And I needed to accomplish all of this yesterday.</p><p>Something in me wants to listen to my therapist making the same push that lyric is. I have been through a lot. I need to recover. I need to process. But I don&rsquo;t have the time or, as it feels at this point, the capacity. And the shame of my diagnosis still lingers in here, too, feeling like I do not deserve any rest. I did not really suffer. I am just lazy and incompetent. </p><p>Motherfucker, it was stage 3 cancer! Is that not enough!?</p><p>Apparently not to me.</p>
