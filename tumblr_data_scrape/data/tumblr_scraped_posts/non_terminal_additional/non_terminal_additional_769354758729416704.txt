My Two Legs are Broken, But Look at Me Dance

<h1>My Two Legs are Broken, But Look at Me Dance</h1><p>I know at least two people I know personally who can see this, so I want to make this explicit: I am not in danger. I&rsquo;ve been through this many times before, I&rsquo;ll do it again. It has just gotten easier to write than to talk now.</p><p>While riding back home with some friends, one of them brought up a very good point: I dealt/deal with all of the fear, pain, and shame that cancer brings, so taking on smaller ordeals pale in comparison. And this was very much the case during the initial phase of my diagnosis.</p><p>I, like so many folk, have depression that ranges from a fog to a typhoon. From still being able to laugh to wishing I stopped breathing. And during some of my cancer treatment, that largely stopped. Funnily enough, my suicidality was scared of the actual threat of death. My landlord had extended grace, a few family members and friends stepped up to support. I had things to be grateful for, including getting one of the more treatable versions of cancer and finally being able to feel almost normal on the non-chemo weeks. I was in maintenance mode and I did not have enough available resources for depression.exe to run.</p><p>This did not last very long, even during treatment. I&rsquo;m looking through my notes now and seeing how much I broke down during the latter half of treatment. I read over the note in August of how I was awake crying at 4 AM wishing my mother was still alive so I could talk to her about how much I was suffering, even through I never fully opened to her like that before she passed. And now I am left in remission, grateful for the status but struggling with everything that entails. The depression and self-loathing is back and stronger than ever, latching onto the physical and mental setbacks the diagnosis and treatment left. I feel disconnected from cancer patients and communities even though I am only a month-long survivor and am at the highest risk for recurrence. I feel incapable to re-enter the world as I, my landlord, and those that depend on me need me to. I am stuck in limbo, too broken to ascend and too well to descend.</p><p>Throw in my growing feelings of dystopia around trying to get a job and what the rest of my life feels like it will feel like and I, in some ways, feel worse than when I was going through treatment. Like I went through the suffering to possibly have a future but I am too incompetent and afraid and depressed to actually have one. Is this just gonna be it? I get a job that pays just enough for me to lose my food and medical assistance and I can&rsquo;t afford the treatment when I relapse? I&rsquo;m stuck being this fat and stupid and looked down upon in my professional and personal life, as I should be? I keep stressing and feeling like I am never enough and don&rsquo;t have enough in me to be a person or really enjoy things? What is the point? </p><p>What did I fight for? </p>
