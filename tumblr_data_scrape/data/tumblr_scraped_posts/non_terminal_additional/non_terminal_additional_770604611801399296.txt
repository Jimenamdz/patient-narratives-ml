A Failed Submission

<h1>A Failed Submission</h1><p>(This was supposed to be for a cancer support magazine. The prompt was &ldquo;how was cancer stuck with you?&rdquo;. I never finished it. Here is what I wrote.)</p><p>I named my stage 3b Hodgkin lymphoma Johan.</p><p>And while I am out of treatment and in remission, I feel like Johan will never really leave me.</p><p>Depending on the day, I feel less that he is gone and more that he is dormant, like a parasite in my chest that was only sedated by how much poison was pumped into me. Shrunk and weakened, but just biding his time and building his strength to reemerge when I finally start feeling normal. I am early in my first year of remission and my anxiety made sure to hold onto the statistics of recurrence. Anything above zero feels like one hundred. My fear spikes with every prolonged cough, restless night, and tired day, no matter how much I tell myself the near-infinite alternative explanations for my symptoms. I know I will live with this fear for the rest of my life, the fear of going through cycles of chemo or any other treatment where it’s a race of who taps out first, him or me.</p><p>Even if he never shows his disgusting face again, the damage he and the treatment did can only be mitigated, not undone. My body is heavier. My energy is diminished. My brain is slower. I will never be the same person I was before all of this happened. I’m ashamed of the person I am now.</p><p>And there is my father. He has his own Johan, too.</p>
