Depression Without the Depression?

<h1>Depression Without the Depression?</h1><p>I have been sleeping my days away for the past couple of weeks. </p><p>If there was not a specific event I needed to attend or task I needed to fulfill, I would, and still do, stay in bed and keep forcing myself to sleep whether through repeated attempts, sleeping pills, or alcohol.</p><p>This is a very telltale indicator for depression.</p><p>But I am not feeling the depression part.</p><p>I am more troubled than depressed. I still am struggling with issues like unemployment and cancer fear/processing, but I do not have that same emotional aspect of depression that I am used to. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t feel depressed, but I still lack a will to do anything or be conscious. My desire for death is not very prominent at the moment, but I can&rsquo;t say I have a will to live either. Just this uncomfortable empty limbo state.</p><p>So is this still depression? Or is this just who I am, a lazy nothing? </p><p>What am I, really?</p>
