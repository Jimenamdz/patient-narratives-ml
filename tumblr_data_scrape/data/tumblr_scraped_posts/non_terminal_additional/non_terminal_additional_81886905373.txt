Woo!

<p>My appointment on Thursday was fine! My bloodwork is all good and the doctor said I&rsquo;m healthy. No pesky lumps in sight!</p>

<p>To be honest, the relief afterwards was exhausting. I&rsquo;d spent time worrying that it would all come back and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to move to Dublin for another year and that I&rsquo;d die from it - then I spent time trying not to worry about it all, which is pretty knackering in itself! I know I&rsquo;m always going to get like this everytime an appointment comes up but I also know that it will get a lot easier as time passes. I think that patience and acceptance will be my weapons of choice here.</p>

<p>It also means that I can 100% plan my move to Dublin. I think I&rsquo;ve been a little wary of announcing the move in a more public space because I didn&rsquo;t want to jinx myself. It would be horrible to plan a moving date, get a job, a flat and then find out that I couldn&rsquo;t go because my cancer had come back.</p>

<p>I feel liberated and that I can now do anything I want to! The past 9 months have been hellish but I think I can now start living properly and figuring out where I want to go.</p>
