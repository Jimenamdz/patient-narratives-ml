<p>You know how some people think that goths live super ultra spooky at all times, but in reality we’re pretty much basic as hell? Because I was thinking that I would honestly love to live “perceived goth lifestyle” and live in a huge mansion next to a graveyard and sleep in a coffin and be decked out head to toe in velvet frills and fishnets at all hours of the day and work the night shift and have a pet bat named Dmitrius and yeah man sign me up</p>
