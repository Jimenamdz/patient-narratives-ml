<p>A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. At my age (37), itâ€™s rare to get this kind of cancer. Even though Iâ€™ve not been through chemo yet (I have to let my surgery wound heal first), I know I will beat this thing. But there are some days where everything is completely overwhelming and frustrating and I just have to scream and cry, and thatâ€™s ok. No matter what youâ€™re going through, if youâ€™re hurt, overwhelmed, or mad&hellip;. itâ€™s ok to cry. </p><p>On a brighter note, this now gives me a valid reason to get my medical marijuana card! ðŸ˜‚</p>
