So it's Lymphoma Awareness Week...

<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna make you all aware :)</p>

<p>Hodgkin's Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It affects the lymphatic system. <br/>Out of all the cancers to have, it&rsquo;s a pretty curable cancer to have, with stages 1 and 2 being 93% cured after treatment. Though it get&rsquo;s a little tricky in the advanced stages. </p>

<p>Usually, it can be treated with chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy too, if you&rsquo;re not clear after the first two months of chemo. <br/><br/>Not many people are actually aware of what lymphoma is, or that it&rsquo;s a cancer. Many have no clue what your lymph nodes do. Lymph nodes are part of the immune system; so you can imagine it&rsquo;s pretty necessary for them to be working. To go into how they work and what they do will actually take me ages so I won&rsquo;t bore you, if you are reading :P<br/><br/>Anyways, I know so much about it is because I had it two years ago. And it was bloody hell. I had stage 4, and it was legit EVERYWHERE, like it&rsquo;s not even exaggerated. I have 6 months of chemo and 11 sessions of radiotherapy. It was hell. I had a bunch of mental breakdowns and issues and I&rsquo;m still seeing a shrink, bu t that&rsquo;s not the point. The point is I survived.</p>

<p>I met a girl at a Teens Unite Fighting Cancer sessions thing a few weeks agao and she never understood why I never told anyone about my cancer, and why I didn&rsquo;t get support from people. The truth is I was an idiot and I really should have told people but what is done is done. Too late to change it now. She said that making people aware of the different types of cancers can push people to fundraise more and help find a cure. And she was right. </p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m awareing people of it now. Because it is a rare disease to get and not many people are aware. If I had know more about the symptoms and what it actually was, it wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten to the stage that it did. And that you can help find a cure and help those who need it the most :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m doing to help others, and to make you aware of what it is. </p>

<p>Yeah. I think that&rsquo;s enough babbling :) If you read it all, thanks :)</p>
