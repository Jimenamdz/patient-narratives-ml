<p>This is really late because I’ve been in the hospital on pain meds all day for a severe ear infection. but on this day 4 years ago(1/31/18) I was diagnosed with cancer…. It’s just a weird feeling like it’s the day my life would never be the same. When the doc told me I felt relived and a bit broken. I had been looking for an answer to my pain and sickness for a year, and was the youngest in the country with a diagnosis (14 y/o) I was given 2 months to live and had to travel halfway across the country for medical care back and forth. The last four years have been the most traumatic of my life. But today I may be in the hospital for an ear infection but I’m alive. I lost my voice box, I had major reconstructive surgery (multiple times), I had to accept I’m now permanently disabled and it was hard to accept. Very Long story short: I still have major physical and mental scars but I’m alive. I know I’m pouring it all out to strangers on the internet but I felt I needed to share:)</p>
