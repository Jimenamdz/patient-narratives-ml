<p>So I answered a Q &amp; A. The contents resulted in a pretty good synopsis of my health during the past few years., so I&rsquo;m adding it here. </p><p>I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about 8 years ago. I immediately lost about 20 lbs and my blood glucose did go down. I resented being diagnosed just days before Halloween (as I looked forward to all that food coming in the holidays). But that first set of holidays, I persevered. I have struggled with motivation to &ldquo;be good&rdquo; and my resolve has often lapsed.</p><p>Now, I have been diagnosed with Stage IV malignant melanoma (which is way more than just skin cancer). Have had lesions removed from my back, a huge mass removed from my right arm, and am getting treatment for the mass in my lung. I&rsquo;m getting a biopsy on a lump in my breast sometime next week, and an ultrasound on my thyroid probably at the same time.</p><p>With all that worry, my glucose levels have rollercoasted as have my emotions. However, I figure (in my more sanity-guided moments) I will let the docs deal with the cancer, and try to pay attention to the diabetes.</p><p>Most days I find myself&hellip;</p><p>After work (substitute teaching), I am fatigued so I might nap, then feed the dogs, give one of them her insulin, have some kind of dinner myself, and cloister myself to catch up on Netflix or some show. Or I try to research the cancer I have and learn about treatment therapies..</p><p>Given what I know now, I would recommend others&hellip;</p><p>Everyone&rsquo;s situation is different. I do recommend some self evaluation. Writing in a journal (the food I eat, the mood I&rsquo;m in, events of the day that might trigger overeating, etc.) help me greatly to understand what&rsquo;s happening in my mind to motivate indulgence that might not be the best choice for my body.</p><p>What I could use is suggestions for ways to &ldquo;treat&rdquo; myself, or &ldquo;reward&rdquo; or &ldquo;console&rdquo; myself that don&rsquo;t involve food or money.</p><p>My life has changed in this way&hellip;</p><p>Mostly I feel nearly defeated. Sometimes I&rsquo;m resentful. I was always physically active, running, skiing, tennis, biking, and swimming. Injuries forced me to stop in my 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s. I became sort of a sloth.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve moved into a three-story home, and I do walk up and down several times each day. I know I need to do more. The first door (my front door) is the most challenging to get through when I need to exercise.</p>
