Enough….

<p>Enough….</p><p>Acceptance.  Acceptance that I have traveled enough.  That I have followed enough trains of thought.  That I have achieved enough and that I have made a difference. I have touched enough lives and made a difference in those lives.  Enough….it’s a comforting word as I revert my gaze from the rear view mirror of my life and focus once again on what lies ahead.  I smile contently as I see terminal cancer, palliative care and death uphead.</p>
