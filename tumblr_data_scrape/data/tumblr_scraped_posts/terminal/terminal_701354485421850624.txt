To Share Or Not To Share

<h1>To Share Or Not To Share</h1><p>There is no rule book for cancer. No guidelines to tell you how you are supposed to feel or act. No list (God how I love a list!) of tasks to check off. But to me, there has never been a question of not sharing this ‘journey’ with the people in my life. How are people supposed to support you, show empathy and general kindness if they don’t know what you are going through? And let’s face it, I’ve always worn my heart on my sleeve so why should this be any different…</p><p>So I’ll use this blog as a place to inform you all of my progress, vent my frustrations and maybe help others who find themselves in this impossible situation because the fact is that we do not talk about cancer enough. Before my initial diagnosis in 2016, I had never even heard of my particular kind of cancer (GIST) and every single person I talked to about it outside of the medical profession had never heard of it either. I had no idea what I was dealing with.</p><p>The current situation is thus:</p><p>I have five tumours in my abdomen of varying sizes. The biggest is just over 2cm. The original singular gist was around 12cm. This recurrence is metastatic (more than one tumour) – never a word you want to hear when dealing with cancer – but the good news is that they are all in the same place and haven’t migrated to other parts of my body. Surgery is not possible so I’m being placed onto an oral chemotherapy drug called Imatinib. The aim of the drug is to prevent the tumours from growing/spreading further and, if I’m really lucky, shrink them into oblivion. My oncologist gave about an 80% chance of that happening. There is a chance though that one or more of the tumours will be resistant to the Imatinib and grow, in which case they would consider surgery on those stubborn clumps. There is also a chance that the Imatinib won’t work at all, in which case there are currently 4 other drugs that they could try to get it under control. She estimated that if the Imatinib is successful then, on average, it works for 3 years. When the tumours inevitably become resistant, it’s time to try the next drug.</p><p>Best case scenario is that the Imatinib works immediately and the next scan in 3 months shows that they have shrunk or disappeared. However, if this happens, I still have to take the drugs. For life. This is because what we do know about this rare cancer is that it is aggressive and while it may not always be big enough to show up on a CT scan it is always going to be there, lurking, even if it is just a microscopic cell. I really appreciate honesty and thankfully my oncologist does not sugar-coat anything – the word she used was “incurable” and whilst that word is terrifying I think in the long term it’s best to know this. Though she does remain otpimistic that I should be around for a “long time yet…”</p><p>So, this is where we’re at. This is what I’m trying to process. I’ll blog again after I’ve gathered my thoughts further.</p>
