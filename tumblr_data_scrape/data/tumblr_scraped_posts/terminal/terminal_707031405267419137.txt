<p>Tired of everyone telling me to &ldquo;stay positive!&rdquo; &ldquo;Live each day to the fullest!&rdquo; or whatever other inspirational quote they can dig up. </p><p>I get it, they&rsquo;re trying to help. But I don&rsquo;t feel cheerful or positive and my life isn&rsquo;t a Hallmark movie where everything turns out okay thanks to a miracle in the final half hour. </p><p>I have terminal cancer, it&rsquo;s going to kill me. It&rsquo;s a matter of when, not if, and I don&rsquo;t feel like being cheerful.</p>
