Make-up Toxicity

<h1>Make-up Toxicity</h1><p>I, like many people of my generation, love makeup. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="400" data-orig-width="500" data-tumblr-attribution="themakeupbrush:HY5-Fr8Jr7Y11eNMiwy5uw:ZRgv0vcFAu6Diq00"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/771b38fe61fccd54150d39bd8e930014/d7362e17b1ce4c17-c6/s2048x3072/e71b1658db5db39ededcbcbf99ced0ef63b95459.gif" data-orig-height="400" data-orig-width="500" data-media-key="771b38fe61fccd54150d39bd8e930014:d7362e17b1ce4c17-c6" alt="image"/></figure><p>Growing up during the late 2000′s and 2010′s cosmetic influencers played a very important role. To this day there are many young Gen Z’ers and Gen Alphas that are coming into contact with make-up content, and generally love cosmetics.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="550" data-orig-width="431" data-tumblr-attribution="scifisblog:9jB8TaWic08LZsbZ8Lsfgg:ZLlaSi2nBDPvZ"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2508f1944b154382615f4fc76ac1ed8c/d7362e17b1ce4c17-91/s2048x3072/b6032edab140563f8f49deaafc9b23231215ff27.gif" data-orig-height="550" data-orig-width="431" data-media-key="2508f1944b154382615f4fc76ac1ed8c:d7362e17b1ce4c17-91" alt="image"/></figure><p>Cosmetics are not just make up, “ <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/cosmetics/what-is-cosmetic.html">A &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; is <b>any substance used to clean, improve or change the complexion, skin, hair, nails or teeth</b>. Cosmetics include beauty preparations (make-up, perfume, skin cream, nail polish) and grooming aids (soap, shampoo, shaving cream, deodorant).”  </a></p><p>We don’t discuss enough how absolutely dangerous some of these products  are on the market.</p><p>I’m not just talking about your cheap dollar store make-up.</p><p>I am 100% talking about your super popular favorite eye-shadow palettes, your $60+ foundation, and your most loved mascara.</p><p>I am talking about your body wash, lotion, and even your aluminum free deodorant. Your toothpaste, your hair creams, and your gel nail polish that you cure with a uv lamp.</p><figure data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="276" data-tumblr-attribution="gottastim:oQDXjwuGbOO8TnQTDZK1fg:Z0hyDgbMnjUMCy00"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b6362db0faf5a3249aabc7da42ac28b6/d7362e17b1ce4c17-ee/s2048x3072/29abab4e169e17e55c749d7f79e53ab1d8fc6f9d.gif" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="276" data-media-key="b6362db0faf5a3249aabc7da42ac28b6:d7362e17b1ce4c17-ee" alt="image"/></figure><p>These chemicals are being placed on parts of your body that are supremely delicate, and your body is processing (or not) all of the materials within those products.</p><p>I feel completely psychotic writing this all down, and I doubt anyone will stop to read.

Where did it come from? Why am I doing this? And is it worth it?” </p><p>I can talk about a million different things that we need to change in this world, like what is our furniture made up of, and are you sure your home was built with materials that are safe for you to live in, what about your mattress? </p><p>Are you cooking with plastic utensils, eating off of plastic plates, and cooking on a scratched up non-stick pan? Cause I know I am. I have. And I’m learning that much of the things that are natural to me, in this world, are not safe. Much of the food and products we consume on the daily are putting our families at risk.</p><p>So please do your due diligence and take care of yourself in a way that your government won’t. </p>
