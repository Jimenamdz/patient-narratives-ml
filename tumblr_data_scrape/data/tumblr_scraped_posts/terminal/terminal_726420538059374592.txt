<h1>Big news! Every 3 months I have to have a CT on my chest, abdomen and pelvis and a full body bone scan. I have been agonizing over it for weeks now as the last one i had showed that my first treatment was no longer working. It worked at first and then stopped working after about a month or two. So I started this new medication called Lynparza as well as my Lupron shots to stop all estrogen production so my cancer won&rsquo;t spread. My doctor personally called me to tell me the results of my scans. NO NEW GROWTH and my breast tumor has shrank by about half. It was about 4 cm and now it&rsquo;s about 2 cm. My body seems to also be trying to repair itself. So far, my new meds are working! I sobbed my heart out on the phone. I think I had a panic attack from all the pent up stress. Hopefully it keeps working. There is a pretty big side effect with this medication. I recognize and understand it. I accept it. I feel it is absolutely worth the risk as do my doctors. IF I am on this medication for 20 or 30 years I could end up with leukemia because of it. I have stage 4 cancer. If I live 20 or 30 years because of this medicine, I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a win. I never thought I&rsquo;d root for a medicine that can give me cancer, but here we are. I just hope my scans continue to show no new growth and that I&rsquo;m around for a long time. </h1>
