The Month I was Never Meant to See

<h2>The Month I was Never Meant to See</h2><p>Hey there I&rsquo;m B. I have sarcoma. If you&rsquo;re reading this, it&rsquo;s December. </p><p>I know to most people that doesn&rsquo;t mean a whole lot beyond the holidays. This month for me is surreal in many ways. </p><p>Earlier this year, I learned that the cancer I had was misdiagnosed. I was given a new terminal diagnosis of stage 4 sarcoma. If I decided to stop treatment and go into hospice care, I wasn’t expected to see Christmas of the same year. </p><p>I chose to continue to persue treatment to, at the very least, hopefully prolong my life. </p><p>Staring down the barrel of this month is horrifying. Every day of it is one I wasn’t supposed to see. Then again every day of it feels like it could be the last. It&rsquo;s this sickening mix of pride and panic. </p><p>This is a time I didn’t expect to see. Even with treatment. Every day I wake up is a relief but also fills me with fear. Yes I woke up today but what about tomorrow? </p><p>With the way things are looking for me, this fear can be considered almost irrational. Yes I&rsquo;m sick, yes I&rsquo;m weak, but I&rsquo;m also going through treatment. Treatment that has me on a trajectory for recovery.</p><p>So why am I still experiencing this fear? </p><p>The simple answer is trauma. I was given a time limit for how long I&rsquo;ll live. Once you&rsquo;ve been told that, you can&rsquo;t unhear it. It’s impossible to forget the time you shouldn&rsquo;t be here to see. This time where you weren&rsquo;t expected to be alive. It&rsquo;s a sureal and hard to explain experience. I feel like I&rsquo;m in the back of a store or wandered into a construction zone. It&rsquo;s a feeling of wrongness, of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to be here&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m out of place in my own life. </p><p>So here I am. In the month I was never meant to see. Crawling my way through it in disbelief. I won&rsquo;t be able to relax until I&rsquo;ve made it out the other side. </p><p>Until next time</p><p><br/></p><p>Cross-post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MrTechnodad/s/5lPwjCPpOa">Reddit</a></p>
