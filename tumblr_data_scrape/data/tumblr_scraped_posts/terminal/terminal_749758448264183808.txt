On the 3rd of April I was in the hospital for a DVT blood clot. While treating the clot, a mass was discovered in my abdomen....

While treating the clot, a mass was discovered in my abdomen. After a biopsy I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. </p><p>A week and a half later I had an IVC filter placed on my chest and two days later I had the mass, my uterus, my ovaries and anything else that had the cancer on it as well as, what the nurse said, several cysts. (Bonus note six months earlier I was told I had one cyst and it would go away on its own.)</p><p>They also discovered some spots on my lung. I had a very frightening biopsy done and was told my endometrial cancer had moved to my lungs and was stage IV (four). </p><p>It has been three weeks now since my full hysterectomy and I am healing pretty well from what I understand. Tomorrow I will have a second follow up and we will discuss, I suppose, where to go from there. My doctor hinted at multiple types of chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy.</p><p>I am not handing this well mentally. Physically, I am mostly fine. I have dull sometimes sharp pain in my abdomen and I am not doing well with the metal IVC (I am allergic to metal and it makes me itch). I know if I get chemo it is only going to get harder. I am scared and reallyâ€¦ there is nothing I can do.</p>
