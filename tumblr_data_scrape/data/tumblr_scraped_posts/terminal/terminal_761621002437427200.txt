It was a long week, but it went by so fast!

<h1>It was a long week, but it went by so fast!</h1><p>It sounds contradictory, but that&rsquo;s how it felt.</p><p>The payoff from the golden treadmill allowed me to knock out the last of my medical expenses for the year. I never received a bill for my return trip after my incision infected. That was a substantial ER visit, then a few days in the hospital. When a patient returns with complications within 30 days, it triggers an automatic inquiry. There was no bill to my insurance, and no bill to me. </p><p>A lot of people have urged me to sue. Just like with my primary care guy who diagnosed me with being female in 2021, a lot of people have been beating the drums for malpractice. In the case of my primary care doctor, he has since retired and left the country. I am aware that I could sue. I don&rsquo;t want to. I&rsquo;m 58, I have survived stage four cancer, had it come back, had another surgery. It could come back again. I do not know the number of my days, I am on the measured mile. I don&rsquo;t want to spend it giving depositions and going in and out of courtrooms. Let me have my peace.</p><p>Today is about lounging in bed with cats, cooking good food, assembling a new kitty tree, and toting the old one down to the curb. There are parts of it I am going to save, because they can be used on other kitty trees. I may have enough parts to build a giant kitty jungle gym! Doesn&rsquo;t he deserve a giant kitty jungle gym? And he is a giant kitty - from the base of his neck to the base of his tail is almost 19 inches.</p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1836" data-orig-width="3264"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s640x960/169994da3f093bccea4bdb0ffe1f2c71263f45e0.jpg" data-orig-height="1836" data-orig-width="3264" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s75x75_c1/c911238c861253cc5c5f9a37fde7787cd06fb29f.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s100x200/d45a9ddb252af5bd0ec296518aa9df50ffeea2ec.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s250x400/9ddb4005705e5b7a1f6f656accae8d8d89e47150.jpg 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s400x600/15d07a40109ad91a75d56079296cc6c9fcfbfe18.jpg 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s500x750/14378adc2381a6be755105471b6568de1ee2f65f.jpg 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s540x810/2f1895e80f2d908762381b9988af743e7369652d.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s640x960/169994da3f093bccea4bdb0ffe1f2c71263f45e0.jpg 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s1280x1920/8faea5b247a93e566baf02e09b3619943f93a516.jpg 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d924e5d0f77c59ad26d0f01d0dc2f709/7f7e8950356d02cc-9d/s2048x3072/afc3a1cce32bd3b9841564e7a01786e331e53edb.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><p>Life is good.</p>
