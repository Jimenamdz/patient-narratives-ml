*blows dust off the blog*

<p>*blows dust off the blog*</p><p>Okay, I&rsquo;m back. I needed a place to talk about current events in my life and maybe escape a wee tiny bit into fandom because life has been kicking my ass this year. It turns out, quite literally. </p><p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into all of it, but the culmination of a year of rough stuff has been a diagnoses of stage IV colon cancer for myself. That means the cancer started in my colon but got curious and started noodling around in my lymph nodes and liver. </p><p>It&rsquo;s been a ride. The survival stats aren&rsquo;t great for the diagnoses, but they&rsquo;re also at least few years old by their very nature, regarding a cancer for which treatment developments are happening fast. They also represent the general population of stage IV patients which include a lot of elderly people with co-morbidities. At 51, I&rsquo;m just a young whipper snapper and a relatively healthy one at that. It also matters where in your colon the cancer pops up and mine happens to be in a place where the type of cancer is more &ldquo;mundane&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s a term that&rsquo;s used apparently) and often more vulnerable to chemo. So there&rsquo;s *lots* of hope!</p><p>Thera also lots of bad stuff. The worst thing I&rsquo;ve ever done to my kids is telling them I have this cancer. I have a pretty positive attitude, but the effect this and possible outcomes might have on them is the one thing that really threatens to drag me into a darker place. But! They&rsquo;re fantastic, amazing, intelligent, caring people, so I have every faith we&rsquo;ll get through this.</p><p>Anyhow, that&rsquo;s the news. I&rsquo;m not a warrior fighting a battle, so none of that nonsense. I&rsquo;m also not receptive to any suggestions that I can cure this with teas or crystals. What I need is science and oodles of dark humour and butt jokes. I mean, what&rsquo;s the sense of getting colon cancer if you can&rsquo;t appreciate good butt jokes? </p>
