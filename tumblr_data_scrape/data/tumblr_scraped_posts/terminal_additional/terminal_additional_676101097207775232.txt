You are not a burden, and even if you technically &ldquo;&quot;could&rdquo;&ldquo; drive you are not obligated to if it would be unsafe for you or others</p><p>Not being able to drive can be an inconvenience, but it is not a moral or personal failing. If anything, the failing is on behalf of society for not having better and more convenient public transportation for everyone</p></blockquote><p>Louder for those in the back: </p><h1>The failing is on society for not having better public transportation</h1></blockquote>
