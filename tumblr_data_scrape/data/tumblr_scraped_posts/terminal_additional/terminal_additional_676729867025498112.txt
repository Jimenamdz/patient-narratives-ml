<p>I think I already reblogged this but im gonna do it again because this is a good reminder on how toxic gatekeeping it.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I’m reblogging this for the amount of thought that was put into figuring out the necessary configuration for a mertaur wheelchair. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>MMMMM, the LAYERS to this. </p>
<p>She’s technically a monster too. She might not look it at first glance and seems mostly human, but it isn’t deniable even despite her looks compared to the other monsters. </p>
<p>But she realizes that she is still not like the rest of the monsters either and may not have entirely the same experiences as them, which is why she feels that she might not belong to or deserve to go to the support group. By sometimes passing as human, she feels she isn’t worthy of the space. </p>
<p>The sad reality though is even though she’s <i>mostly </i>human in appearance, that tail she has undeniably would still cause her some struggle. Humans are still gonna look at that tail and think she’s a freak. There are probably still accommodations she needs because of the tail that she may still struggle to have access to. Even if it is just the tail, that tail is still enough to other her from humans and cause her problems and discrimination. </p>
<p>She should get to belong in that support group even if she gets told she’s not monster “enough”. She still shares <i>some</i> of the same struggles as them that are caused by being a monster, and needs support. </p>
<p>This is an excellent demonstration of the flaws in the concept of passing privilege. Bravo to the artist. </p>

<p>NOW I will reblog this. </p>

<p>Image description: A comic in seven panels</p><p>Panel 1: A wolf man wearing a pale blue polo shirt and dark blue pants faces the viewer. He is saying, “Uh… I’m sorry ma’am, but this is a support group for monsters <i>only.” </i>With his right hand, he gestures to a group of monsters sitting around a table in the background. The monsters are a giant bat, a gorilla, and a dragon. They are facing away from the viewer.</p><p>Panel 2: A white woman with blonde hair wearing a pink striped shirt and dark capri pants says with a smile, “Well, <i>actually</i>, I AM a monster.” The wolf man replies, looking skeptically, “… How?”</p><p>Panel 3: The woman responds, while looking at the viewer, “Well, you see, my mother was a mermaid and my father was a minotaur.” Above her head, there is a thought cloud depicting a mermaid in a tank holding hands and looking lovingly at a Minotaur who is standing outside of the tank.</p><p>Panel 4: The wolf man, still looking dismissive, says, “Riiight. And let me guess: You got the human half from both of them.” The woman responds, “Exactly!” The wolf man says, “Gotcha. <i>Hardy har har</i>.”</p><p>Panel 5: The wolf man points and makes a snarling face at the woman, saying, “Ya know, it’s insensitive mockery like this that makes us need these groups in the first place.” The woman holds up her hands defensively, leaning away and looking surprised. She says, “Huh?”</p><p>Panel 6: The woman says, “Listen sir, I’m just here to drop off my brother and I’ll be on my way.” She still has a worried expression and gestures to her brother behind her. Her brother has a Minotaur upper half and a fish lower half. He is riding a mobility device. He says, “This guy buggin’ you sis?” while raising an eyebrow.” The wolf man looks astonished.</p><p>Panel 7: The woman is shown walking off-panel to the left. She says over her shoulder, “I’ll be back to pick you up at seven.” Since her back is to the viewer, we can now see that she has a tail. Her brother says, “Sounds good, thanks.” The wolf man continues to look astonished.”</p><p>End ID<br/></p></blockquote>


<p>Thanks for the image description! </p></blockquote>


<p>This comic really sums up how I feel as a white passing mixed person </p></blockquote>


<p>this comic is how I feel as a white passing mixed person, how I feel as an invisibly disabled person, and how I feel as a queer people with complicated/contradictory labels</p></blockquote>


<p>Damn it. I’m supposed to be watching a TV show and now I’m crying. </p><p>This is how I feel as a dynamically disabled person. </p><p>I’ve never had the words to describe this like the comic described this. </p><p>-fae</p></blockquote>
