One day there was a swarm in the parking lot and people were freaking out because, y'know, BEES EVERYWHERE. Beekeeper guy went to his truck. Pulled a swarm-catching box out. Put it on the ground and walked away. <br/><br/>Bees went in the box after a while. Guy put the box back in his truck and drove home with them. </p><p>You cannot <i>prevent</i> bees from leaving a hive they don’t like the conditions of, without also preventing them from being able to make honey. The latter is dependent on them being able to come and go as they please. If they don’t like their hive THEY WILL LEAVE. </p><p>Beekeeping is probably the single most non-exploitative animal agriculture in the entirety of human history. I don’t know how it’s even possible to exploit bees. They answer only to their queen. </p></blockquote><p>On that note, if their queen isn’t doing her job, they make up done queen jelly and feed it to a new bee to make a new queen and can kill the old one. </p><p>They answer to their queen, but no monarchy is exempt from the guillotine</p></blockquote>
