<p>Don’t forget trash! I had a job that had a lift that I had to share with the TRASH. (Because an abled bodied person didn’t feel like carrying the bag of trash themselves. When I called the store out on it I was told I was being too unfriendly, unfair, and mean.) </p></blockquote>


<p>This is so important for abled people to see and start recognizing. Because guess what? Most places don’t listen to disabled people. I have worked on 2 med school campuses. TWO. And do you know the worst offenders of blatantly ignoring disabled people were? The fucking emergency rooms, next was the cafeteria and cafes! </p><p>I can’t use stairs if its more than a couple of steps, my knees will give out and now I’m sprawled on the floor. With documentation of this, I was denied access to the elevator in my building during a fire drill. I had a coworker help me the rest of the way down because my left knee refused to support my weight. Someone else that worked in the building who uses a wheel chair was also denied the elevator and when the fire Marshal was doing his sweep, he found her on the 5th floor by herself. Wtf. Only reason I know is because when he was talking to us, I pointed out that I was denied the elevator and he brought that up. Unless the fire is effecting the elevators, they are to stay on during a fire. Period. And there’s multiple elevators through out the building so there was no reason for them all to be off. </p><p>At the most recent campus I worked on, I went to the ER for paperwork because of an exposure, and there was someone trapped outside the elevator room because the door was stupid heavy and they had crutches. I was able to get it open and we went up together, I talked to maintenance about it and they got a work order put in. </p><p>Or automatic doors that close to fast that dint have sensors!</p><p>Or ramp grip/indicators that are large and get caught on wheels. </p><p>Or building ramps that are too steep.</p><p>Or disabled parking spots without ramps. </p><p>Or blocking spots. </p><p>Or locking elevators. </p><p>Or door threshold for sliding doors being taller than needed. </p><p>Or stupid heavy doors. </p><p>Or my absolute favorite one, a step at the bottom or top of a ramp. </p></blockquote>
