<p>ER last night.  Massive migraine headache.  Worse than I&rsquo;ve had in 35 years.  No stroke,  CT scan done,  no metastases in my brain (they did find a brain,  by the way, lol)</p><p><br/></p><p>Doc said it might be a direct side effect of my immunotherapy Wednesday. So, I&rsquo;ll call the oncologist (who I spoke with Tuesday before it got really very bad) </p><p><br/></p><p>Got there at around 7:30 and was home by 10. Good meds helped but didn&rsquo;t completely get rid of the pain.</p><p><br/></p><p>This am, it was back,  but a little different,  shower Exedrin &amp; coffee and made it to work. </p><p><br/></p><p>Cross your fingers I make it through the day. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ™‚</p>
