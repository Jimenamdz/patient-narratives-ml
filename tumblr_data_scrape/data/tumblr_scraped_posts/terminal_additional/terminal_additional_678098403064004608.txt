I need a wheelchair hoist for the car

So I either have to rely on other people coming with me to help me which isn&rsquo;t always practical or easily arranged or getting an electric wheelchair hoist.<br/>I was shocked at the price of them, for an average one it&rsquo;s around £2000 with another £1000 for fitting costs. I just don&rsquo;t have that sort of money available.<br/>With that in mind I have started a gofundme to help me to pay for one.<br/>If you could please take a minute to read it and maybe donate, if not then please share it, that costs you nothing and help me to get a hoist for my car so I can keep my independence.<br/><a href="https://gofund.me/da54d753">https://gofund.me/da54d753</a>
