More venting

<h1>More venting</h1><p>So I feel as if I might have cancer after all.  Side effects from immunotherapy.  Got my 3rd infusion last Wednesday, and felt fine.  I expected the same side effects as the last time.</p><p>I worked Thursday and the headache I&rsquo;ve had for three weeks got really very incredibly bad.  immobilizing even.  After some discussion with my oldest, a friend, and an on-call nurse from my insurance, we decided I needed to call 911 and go to ER, if for nothing else, to make sure it&rsquo;s not a stroke.  </p><p>No stroke, a CTscan revealed no brain metastases, a bunch of blood tests, some new meds to take, and rather quicker than I expected, I was home.  ER doc indicated it is probably a reaction to the immunotherapy. The headache had subsided a little; at least I could get my jammies on and get into my own bed. I was able to work Friday, then by Friday evening my headache returned with vengeance and now, added nausea. My body was definitely rebelling against me.</p><p>Saturday, was awful. It was now the worst headache I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life. So bad, I could not read the prescriptions on the medicine containers. I threw up. Called my oldest. They came over, gave me the right medicine, fresh water, crackers and toast.  It was so comforting to have them help me so sweetly. Oh, but i was down.</p><p>Slept for the rest of the weekend. Got up this morning (Monday) and felt much better, thinking i could work today.  Halfway through the day, I felt that kind of shaky fatigue that makes you think you can&rsquo;t function.  My youngest calls it &ldquo;dizzy tired.&rdquo;  Odd, since I spent the entire weekend in bed, alone, mostly sleeping. </p><p>One more infusion to go. Ugh.</p>
