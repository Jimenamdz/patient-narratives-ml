Podcast Episode 3

<p>I&rsquo;m going to be a YouTube megastar<br/>Just editing Episode three of my podcast, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a YouTube Megastar&rdquo; hopefully it will be ready later today for release.You can find it here when it&rsquo;s released<br/>Editing is a nightmare<br/>The editing is what takes up the time, it takes around 7-10 days to edit each episode.<br/>I was hoping to be able to release an episode each week but that&rsquo;s going to happen because of the time it takes to edit them.<br/>My cancer and my bronchiectasis combined have resulted in my voice having a lot of &ldquo;defects&rdquo; which need to be edited out as well as lots of little noises I am unaware I am making, little splutters and chirrups noises I make as well as when I breathe in which makes a gasping, rattly noise.<br/>My stutter is back<br/>I used to stutter as a child, but I thought I had &ldquo;cured&rdquo; myself of that however making these podcasts has shown me it&rsquo;s back again, not as bad as it was when I was a child but still bad enough that I must edit out the repeated words.<br/>I was completely unaware that I stuttered and I think it night have something to do with my hearing loss getting worse.<br/>I&rsquo;m not really going to be a &ldquo;YouTube Megastar&quot; <br/>No, I&rsquo;m not, that&rsquo;s just me poking fun at myself, this podcast is about the jour﻿ney to try and make a living on YouTube. The first few episodes cover events in my past<br/>
