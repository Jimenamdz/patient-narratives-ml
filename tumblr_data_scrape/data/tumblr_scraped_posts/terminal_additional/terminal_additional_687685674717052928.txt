<p>I have returned to tumblr. I need a place to vent into the void about what’s been happening to me. Warning: it’s depressing sh!t but it’s my life now and I need a diary, so to speak, to help me deal with it. I mean, my therapist suggested the calm app but it’s $60 so I haven’t decided on it yet. Maybe I can listen to it while I post and be double less depressed. Anyway, the reason for this is my stage four cancer diagnosis in February of this year. I was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that’s called neuroendocrine or carcinoid cancer and it’s spread from its original site. So, stage four. Terminal, terminal, terminal. These are my words now for all to see. It’s real. It’s here. I’m facing an infinite void as I type these words into another kind of void. Follow along if you want. If not, here I am anyway. </p>
