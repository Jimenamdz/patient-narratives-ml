I like a nicely trimmed bush

I have used this bus stop for years, it&rsquo;s my local bus stop for some destinations and AFAICT this bush (shrub/tree, whatever it&rsquo;s green and I don&rsquo;t do green shit) has been overgrown onto the pavement like this for years.<br/><br/>It never really bothered me when I could walk and so I gave it no thought at all, that is until I needed to get a bus form there in my wheelchair, it&rsquo;s a real PITA as I have to both back into the bush then drive forwards into it to get onto a bus and it normally leaves me covered in green stuff.<br/><br/>My partner doesn&rsquo;t want me to do anything like either approaching the householder and telling them that their bush is an issue or contacting the local council (It&rsquo;s overgrown onto the pavement by almost a meter, very illegal) about it as birds are nesting in it and anything that is done to cut it back would interfere with the birds and their nests.<br/><br/>This means I have to use another bus stop almost half a mile further away or just put up with having to drive into a bush if I use this stop. Currently I am suffering the bush as the extra drive to the next stop reduces my battery life at my destination.<br/><br/> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RcrPe4yNAo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RcrPe4yNAo</a>
