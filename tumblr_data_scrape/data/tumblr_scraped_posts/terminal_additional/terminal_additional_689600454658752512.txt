You probably still have no idea what I am talking about though  but that&rsquo;s OK, all will become clear when I start to upload the reframed videos.<br/>The software that comes with the camera, Instaone studio is Ok ish for reframing but not as controllable as I need it to be, so I prefer to reframe in editing software. Well, I tried Premier Pro 2002 with the GoPro reframe plug in and it constantly crashed.  So, my &ldquo;fallback&rdquo; software in Davinci Resolve.<br/>For a free program Resolve is very powerful in many respects and reframing 360 footage is one of those that it excels in. I am in the middle of making a tutorial about reframing in Resolve but before we can start doing that, we need to install the plug in that allows us to do this, installing plug-ins in Resolve isn&rsquo;t straightforward so this tutorial is about downloading and installing KARTAVR.<br/>This video tutorial is about installing reactor 3 which allows you run KARTAVR which you need to do the reframing.<br/><br/> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JFDVglVWC4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JFDVglVWC4</a>
