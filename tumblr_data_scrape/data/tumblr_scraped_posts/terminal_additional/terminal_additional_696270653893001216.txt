<p>stand up to cancer</p><p>I wanted to just share this with anyone who has just been diagnosed with cancer in the hope it may help.</p><p>I know all cancers are different, a year ago this week after months of ever increasing pain in my lower back I was finally told the words that we all dread &ldquo; I&rsquo;m sorry to say you have cancer&rdquo;  in some ways for me this was a relief in a strange kind of way at least it explained the ferocious pain I was experiencing that just got worse and worse to the point I could hardly move. For months it was diagnosed as sciatica, I guess I had the similar simptoms. </p><p>It got worse when a few weeks later my world totally disintegrated when I learnt it was advanced agressive prostate cancer. The pain was from Bone Mets that has fractured my vertibrae in several places as well as limph nodes the cancer had also spread to my pelvis. I was in a bad state with no light at the end of the tunnel. I&rsquo;m 55 with two daughters ages 12 &amp; 14 , my world as well as my back was collapsing.</p><p>That was a year ago. Now I&rsquo;m back to work full time as an ambulance driving instructor my pain levels are managed and I&rsquo;ve completely changed my life style from diet to mindset I&rsquo;m a different person but in the same body.</p><p>The tumours have shrunk considerably although my doctor keeps reminding me it&rsquo;s incurable. They say Woody keep doing it whatever it is you are doing I steadfastly refuse to believe that it&rsquo;s incurable and I refuse to let my illness become the centre of my life. My life has changed so much not all of it for the worse. I appreciate life far more than I have ever done. I&rsquo;m grateful for each day and what it brings. My body has been majorly affected by hormone treatment but at least it&rsquo;s keeping me living. </p><p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the simple things I know longer strive to have what I can&rsquo;t have I&rsquo;m happy contented and yet supposedly dying.</p><p>Cancer is no longer the center attraction life goes on.</p><p>My message is no matter what, you have to keep believing. Keep positive. I live by three things be kind to all I meet and try to make a difference in some way be grateful for what I have and stay positive no matter how bad it seems. A year ago I thought my life was over, if this is you in a similar situation don&rsquo;t let the cancer take over, stand up to it and live your life the best way you can. I hope this helps someone out there.</p><p>Woody</p>
