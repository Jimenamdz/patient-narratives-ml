<p>Update time for the few actually watching this. I had a follow up with the cancer center today, after receiving the report two days ago via email  without knowing how to interpret it. I have Glioblastoma multiforme stage 4, which was the original diagnosis, instead of Oligodendroglioma stage 3. BUT it&rsquo;s actually better, weirdly enough. Glio and Oligo are more or less the same, but the Oligo has 1p and 19q chromosome deletion. This does not. Glio is the &ldquo;scarier&rdquo; form of cancer because of the overall mortality rate of 96% over two years, but because of the genes present I have a more favorable prognosis with glioblastoma than Oligodendroglioma. I have a super high concentration of an mgmt wild type gene. Wild type means there is no mutation present, and it responds better to chemo and radiation than Oligodendroglioma. My KI-67 was lower than expected as well. That&rsquo;s what determines overall tumor growth rate. He said of the 4% of patients that survive past 2 years, I have the highest possible chance of not only living beyond that, but actually beating it to some degree. I won&rsquo;t live to retirement age certainly, but there is some rare cases where people live 10-15 years. That wild type gene is essential to get through this. The cost of treatment is astronomical but debt means nothing if I can get through this and be there for my children. It&rsquo;s the best possible conditions for a not so good situation. I&rsquo;ve learned alot of humility and grace through all of this and it&rsquo;s only been 5 weeks. I no longer hold grudges against anyone or anything. Reach out. Let each other know it&rsquo;s okay to not be okay. But most importantly, don&rsquo;t ignore any warning signs your body is trying to tell you about. Also the nurse loved my mask and couldn&rsquo;t keep a straight face. ðŸ˜‚</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2048" data-orig-width="1118"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s640x960/c72268081394e3ca2030ff5318e04b8d9bc36581.jpg" data-orig-height="2048" data-orig-width="1118" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s75x75_c1/bed657c12bfc883e6c35cd9c993464df9281a13f.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s100x200/90c9bb4b82da0acad28a18bdc69654ee91badb50.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s250x400/51844091398d48add51c2c2bb55772e7d7651adc.jpg 218w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s400x600/97d1d0d946cb17741890a142489913c2814ccd3d.jpg 328w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s500x750/25713aea05d6e076e2b432ee39f0a7ad3425b418.jpg 409w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s540x810/737401319dc3f23279240c91b927e802550b978e.jpg 442w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s640x960/c72268081394e3ca2030ff5318e04b8d9bc36581.jpg 524w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s1280x1920/abe0f0bb846d85dd7f157f578bbe69586e46a30e.jpg 1048w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4e2f1df38f8e60133c2f0173ad78b556/875985ccbaf48498-c0/s2048x3072/6448dc626651cb6ea96584e2ad21b2c3d7b804b5.jpg 1118w" sizes="(max-width: 1118px) 100vw, 1118px"/></figure></div>
