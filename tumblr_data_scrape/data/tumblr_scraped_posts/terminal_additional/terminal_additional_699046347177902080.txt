<p>Holllllly shit. This is rough. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the chemo specifically, or the radiation, or a combined effort from both. I&rsquo;m on 10 different daily medications and 4 as needed meds for nausea and headaches. Trying to coordinate when I take them all was a pain. There&rsquo;s different interactions with each one. Some you have to have a after a meal, my chemo pills need to be taken on an empty stomach and an hour before radiation therapy, and some are just before bed. </p><p>Trying to find balance with my med schedule and sleep schedule is no joke. I&rsquo;m also on a strict keto based diet to slow tumor growth progression. So far so good according to the scans I saw today. Hoping against hope that I can last a while longer. It&rsquo;s fucking wild to me that I didn&rsquo;t even know I had it until it was grade 4 and terminal.</p>
