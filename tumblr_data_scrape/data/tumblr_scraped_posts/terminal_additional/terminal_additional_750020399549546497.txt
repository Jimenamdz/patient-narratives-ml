A lot of you on here feel waaay too comfortable admitting that you don't and refuse to listen to rap music, and I'm not loving...

<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="https://peachdeluxe.tumblr.com/post/749978911034703872/a-lot-of-you-on-here-feel-waaay-too-comfortable" target="_blank">peachdeluxe</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A lot of you on here feel waaay too comfortable admitting that you don&rsquo;t and refuse to listen to rap music, and I&rsquo;m not loving the incredibly reductive takes on rap because the kendrick/drake beef has it on some of yall&rsquo;s radar for the first time in your life.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not going to sugar coat it&ndash; for americans especially, if you consider music a significant interest of yours but still feel the need to search for acceptable reasons to keep yourself ignorant of black music, or think of rap as a monolith of hate and violence and not equally as diverse as any other genre, or can only name nonblack rappersâ€¦ you should be embarrassed of that. And your embarrassment should not keep you from being active about exposing yourself to unfamiliar art and broadening what you listen to.</p><p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re saying/they rap too quickly&rsquo; I&rsquo;m surprised by how much I keep seeing this&ndash; speed is not a stylistic trademark of most rap music, &amp; clearer diction as a performer is much more necessary in rap than other genres?? Statistically rap has a lower bpm (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/8jceiw/what_is_the_average_tempo_of_all_music/" target="_blank">here&rsquo;s an example of one person&rsquo;s study</a>) average than other genres. (of course these aren&rsquo;t all-encompassing, but you can look into this yourself using sites like <a href="https://www.bpmdatabase.com/" target="_blank">bpmdatabase.com</a>.) Do you <i>really </i>feel overwhelmed by speed listening to Kendrick or Biggie or Nas or 2Pac, or have you never actually listened to their songs?</p><p>'I have to look up the lyrics&rsquo;&ndash; so what? is it a bad thing to take an extra few seconds to engage with an artist&rsquo;s work? If you listen to lyrical music, do you care when it&rsquo;s the artists you listen to? Why does the thoughtful art consumption everyone talks about not also apply to black art?</p><p>'there is too much violence and misogyny and commercialism&rsquo; this is not unique to rap, or true of all rap music. Artists exist that talk about other things, the way they exist in all genres. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_hip_hop_artists" target="_blank">There is an entire wikipedia page listing alternative hip hop musicians and rappers if you consider seeking it out too much labo</a>r. Click one!</p><p>'i find it unrelatable&rsquo;&ndash; who cares? Being unable to engage with art you don&rsquo;t find wholly relatable is a deeply childish and self centered way to exist. You get on here reblogging feel good navel-gazey posts about the shared human experience and caring for one another, but a rapper talking about living with violence or poverty is stretching the limits of what you can imagine or empathize with too much for you to care about it? You don&rsquo;t find that embarrassing to admit to?</p><p>You don&rsquo;t have to love rap, you don&rsquo;t have to incorporate it into what you listen to every day, but a lot of you need to be aware you&rsquo;re parroting reagan era anti-rap (&amp; antiblack) pearl-clutching talking points, and it&rsquo;s a very ugly look. It isn&rsquo;t racist if your favorite genre isn&rsquo;t rap, but you need to do some serious self reflection if you consider it inherently less artistic, intelligent or positive than 'whiter&rsquo; genres when you don&rsquo;t actually listen to it. I am looking at you, people into other counterculture genres&ndash; it&rsquo;s crazy how much I see this from self-professed punks and metalheads especially lmfao. If expression, counterculture art, anti-censorship in music and the right for raw and unfiltered music to exist matters to you as much as you say you do, you should care about <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/16/975359725/the-racist-roots-of-rap-on-trial" target="_blank">rap&rsquo;s relationship to censorship</a>  &amp; fight for its legitimacy just as much as what you listen to.</p></blockquote>
