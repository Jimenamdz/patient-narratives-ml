Sooooo ummmmmmm this is something that's probably going to piss a lot of people off, but I feel like I really need to say it.
If...

It is a scam. You need to report &amp; delete the message and encourage others to do the same.</p><p>I know because I get messages on this account DAILY. I have a very high follower count and I&rsquo;m pretty active and I interact with my followers a lot, and apparently that all adds up to one big bot magnet.</p><p>Bots following and messaging this account was a MASSIVE problem before Tumblr fixed its new account policies. I used to spend literally hours blocking and reporting the hundreds of bots that I would get following me each day.</p><p>I learned a lot about bots and how to identify them. The easiest way is with no avatar, &ldquo;untitled&rdquo; in the blog description (BTW if your avatar is still set to default PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD change it because you run a substantial risk of being accidentally blocked &amp; reported as a bot).</p><p>One of the dead give aways of a bot was what I call &ldquo;word salad&rdquo; names. Three seemingly random words strung together making no sense, always adjective, adjective or noun, noun. If you reported a lot of these bots, you&rsquo;d notice the same words kept showing up.</p><p>Nowadays, I am bombarded with fundraiser requests and sometimes, they don&rsquo;t even bother to hide the fact that they&rsquo;re a bot. The avatar is default, the blog title is &ldquo;untitled,&rdquo; and the blog name is a classic randomly-generated word salad.</p><p>However MOST of the requests I get come from at least semi-legit looking accounts. There are pictures, a name, a story. Never mind that I&rsquo;ve gotten that message three times from different accounts.</p><p>Sometimes, they claim to be vetted, but the whole vetting system essentially adds up to &ldquo;trust me bro.&rdquo; There is no way of guaranteeing that this account isn&rsquo;t just lying about being vetted, claiming to be vetted by a false person, or are using the identity of a real Palestinian to scam people.</p><p>Previously, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people getting attacked for raising questions about these fundraisers and getting attacked for being racist or for harming Palestinian families in danger, like Tumblr isn&rsquo;t a website famous for its scams and the words &ldquo;The Arkh Project&rdquo; &ldquo;All or Nothing&rdquo; or &ldquo;Miss Officer and Mr. Truffles&rdquo; mean nothing to you.</p><p>I personally have been scammed by people claiming to be charities on Tumblr before, specifically, The Leelah Project which used the name of a trans teenager who died by suicide to swindle people out of their money.</p><p>Luckily, there are actual, respected charities out there you can give money to if you want to help the cause:</p><p><a href="https://www.pcrf.net/" target="_blank">Palestinian Children&rsquo;s Relief Fund</a></p><p><a href="https://www.palestinercs.org/en" target="_blank">Palestine Red Crescent Society</a></p><p><a href="https://www.unrwa.org/" target="_blank">United Nations Relief Works Agency</a></p><p><a href="https://irusa.org/rebuild-gaza/" target="_blank">Islamic Relief</a></p><p><a href="https://wck.org/" target="_blank">World Central Kitchen</a></p><p><a href="https://www.msf.org/" target="_blank">Médecins Sans Frontièrs</a></p><p>One of the hardest things to accept about the situation in Palestine is that realistically, there is very little that your average outsider can do to change it. However, these large, well-respected and trustworthy charities are out there doing the hard work to keep people alive, and should be where the donation money is going</p><p>These scam bots feed on people&rsquo;s naïvety and need to believe that they are making a difference, and even worse, feed on the fear that by ignoring them, it somehow makes you a racist doing direct harm to a refugee family, when in fact they are using the suffering of Palestinians to take away money from those in need.</p><p>As far as fundraisers that don&rsquo;t send out random asks for donations, I honestly don&rsquo;t know. You&rsquo;ll have to do the work yourself and approach with much caution.</p><p>Be careful out there.</p></blockquote>
