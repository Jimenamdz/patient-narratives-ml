Crunch and splat

<h1>Crunch and splat</h1><p>Labs were yesterday, and the 90 minute round trip plus the extraction of so much blood has laid me out. I came home yesterday and passed out for a while, and needed to do it again today. Fatigue to the point where I was cold led to a three hour nap. Meds and soup time - it will take me another few days to bounce back.</p>
