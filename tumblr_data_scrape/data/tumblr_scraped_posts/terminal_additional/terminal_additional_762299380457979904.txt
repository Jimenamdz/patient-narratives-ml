Son of a f*cking-

<h1>Son of a f*cking-</h1><p>So, as if the previous crunch and splat was not enough, I have been &lsquo;spider bit&rsquo; as one of my clients would say. Woke up with it yesterday swollen to the size of half a walnut shell and itching like fury, my arm swelled up, too, almost like a wasp sting. I packed it in baking soda to draw the venom, then crushed up a Benadryl tablet and mixed it with silver chloride gel to dab on the bite. It&rsquo;s much better now, the swelling almost completely gone, but I will keep up the silver chloride just in case it&rsquo;s a fiddlehead or black widow bite.</p><p>Had a widow bite once. Debridement is so not fun.</p><p>As for the spider?</p><p>I tore the bedroom and walk-in closet apart. No fucking spider.</p><p>I took apart furniture. No fucking spider.</p><p>I used the crevice tool to vacuum where I could not reach and then put down Gentrol (bug birth control) stations because I really don&rsquo;t want the cats to get a bite. Poor kitty would feel a lot worse than I did and I do not need the vet bill. I did have body aches, sweating, and a low-grade fever - mostly gone today.</p><p>Tomorrow is all about the kitchen, and I am looking forward to fall food. Cherry cobbler, focaccia, a Frenchish potato soup with ham, mushrooms, and Gruyere, blueberry breakfast bars&hellip; I love being able to cook again!</p>
