Hypnogogia

<h1>Hypnogogia</h1><p>These are kind of pre-dreams, if that makes sense. I have very vivid pre-dreams. this one takes place in my childhood kitchen, cooking and hearing Gran watching her shows. Nothing more than that. Yellow Formica and dark wood cabinets, the stove and double ovens, the smell of a big dinner making. Pies cool on the counter top as I shut the dishwasher and start the cycle, then put the last of the big pans in the dish rack. I hang my apron in the broom closet and went to the pantry, getting the Bosco from the shelf, then the milk from the fridge.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you making hot cocoa?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some for us, too, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; I have no idea who &lsquo;us&rsquo; might be, but the TV room seats four, and I can see one chair empty. Going back and forth, I see bare trees, grey skies, and the winter river with a skim of ice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to snow.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not yet. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;m homesick as I haven&rsquo;t been for over 40 years.</p>
