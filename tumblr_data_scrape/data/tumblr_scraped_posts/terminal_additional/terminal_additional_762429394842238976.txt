Found the f*cking spider

<h1>Found the f*cking spider</h1><p>After tearing apart and moving everything that could be torn apart or moved, I found the spider on the wall next to the bathroom door yesterday. It was brown, perhaps the size of a nickel with legs. It spayed it with canned air keyboard cleaner until it was frosty, then scooped it up with the kittys&rsquo; barf spatula. It was duly conveyed to the toilet where I dumped it in and flushed.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>Just to be sure.</p><p>Look, I get the whim-whams and jim-jams just by looking at images of spiders, okay? </p><p>I hope this is the end of spider incursions. I understand that they are beneficial insects and they keep down other non-beneficial insects. However, rattlesnakes might keep down rodents, but I am not letting one free in the house. </p>
