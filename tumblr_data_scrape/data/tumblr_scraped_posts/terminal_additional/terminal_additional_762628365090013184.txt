Ezra's reckoning

<h1>Ezra&rsquo;s reckoning</h1><p>He knew about Thrawn&rsquo;s crew, of course. In general, they did not come planetside and preferred to spend their money at the Imperial depot&rsquo;s commissary and PX. He knew about Thrawn&rsquo;s SWO, possibly the only officer in the Navy who could shoot. Of course, that was a joke, as the Seventh didn&rsquo;t seem to tolerate inefficiency or (Kassius Konstantine exempted) incompetence. Now that he was Back, it seemed that Thrawn&rsquo;s officers had blown through the galaxy and taken root like scatterpuff seeds. Faro, Marinith, Hammerly, Barlin, Agral, Lomar, Yve, and Pyrondi were now everyone&rsquo;s flag-ranked problems. </p><p>Pyrondi - the Dragon - in particular. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t pull off the Purgill again.</p><p>The Third Fleet followed Grand Admiral Pyrondi as the Seventh had Thrawn. The <i>Chimaera</i>&rsquo;s etched ventral was matched by Pyrondi&rsquo;s dragon on the <i>Imperial lll</i> classed <i>Audacity</i>. It was her name, her flagship, and her reputation. Even the fleet patch carried the motto, &ldquo;Firing Solution: The Shortest Distance between Two Points.&rsquo; It also seemed that nobody much wanted to talk about her. Her entire file including planet of origin was redacted, but there were still clues. He matched images of her in civilian to some of tribal members hundreds of years old - she was more than likely from a place named Jegsziv. A world that was also redacted, and did not appear on any map, anywhere unless you went back to a half-millennia old TaggeCo survey reporting a &lsquo;recovered colony&rsquo; world named Dzeghsziv.</p><p>Mothma and others from Before the Empire led with keeping their mouths shut, and a circle of misdirection that made Ezra feel he was a supporting cast member in a clown show. To be fair, the New Republic did not leave him with the sweet taste of victory. If this was what the Old Republic was like, no wonder it fell. The New Republic just seemed to be the Empire in new clothes. The planets with fewer resources and further from Coruscant got the shaft while the richer systems cut the pie for themselves. </p><p>The Trident Fleet - the Eleventh, Seventh, and Third - held a huge section of the Outer Rim, Wild Space, and strategic parts of the Mid-Rim, having brought the Seswennas into the fold recently, and offering protection for resources. The Trident Fleet contained more than that from massive numbers of defectors. Two other fleets defected almost intact. The Sixth was primarily an engineering fleet, and the Twelfth an expeditionary and supply fleet. Other disaffected personnel made it to the Trident Fleet from every other fleet as well. Some even made it from the survivors of Death Squadron and the First Fleet - all but obliterated at Endor. From everything he could find, the Tridents ran their territories well, if with military efficiency. </p><p>He spoke with Zeb, Hera, and Kallus. </p><p>&quot;You can&rsquo;t argue with someone on the other side of a closed blast door, Ezra, and all of the principal actors had their reasons for joining.&rdquo; Kallus would spend the rest of his life under house arrest, despite his defection and work for the Alliance after that. &ldquo;A lot of them remember the CIS talking points being similar to what the Republic says now. They backed the GAR when it was them and wanted to go back to the old rules after everyone paid in blood to take out Dooku and Grevious.&rdquo;</p><p>Hera and the others watched him and Ezra reflected that everyone else had moved on, but he was still who he was when he left. </p><p>&ldquo;Pyrondi&hellip; the Intel Committee has limited what I can say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Kallus looked at his hands, then made a washing motion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay if we do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Ezra looked at his friends, angry. &ldquo;When we do what? What have 'we&rsquo; done that nobody talks about?&rdquo;</p><p>He stormed out after evasive answers, went back to his room overlooking the Amnesty Lodging and went to bed. In the middle of his sleeping shift, Ezra woke up with a thought banging him in the frontal lobes.</p><p><i>Why do you have to wash your hands? Because they&rsquo;re dirty</i>.</p><p>Kallus and Zeb were not there when he went back the next day. </p>
