Sessions with the brain-fixer and solutions

<h1>Sessions with the brain-fixer and solutions</h1><p>So, my nightmares from medical trauma have not been fun. I know this is my brain&rsquo;s way of trying to process everything that&rsquo;s happened, but the sleep disturbance is hard to deal with. I&rsquo;ll have a run of good sleep, and then nightmares busting out of the cracks. My shrink tells me it&rsquo;s more common than anyone imagines. She&rsquo;s a good shrink, very to the point, and constantly tells me that the things I am going through - as much as they suck - are normal.</p><p>It&rsquo;s comforting not to be the only one.</p><p>The last round of nightmares edged into night terrors with a side of waking paralysis. Spiders, claustrophobia, missing cats, then in the dream I watched black tumors erupting from my body and knew I was dying. I couldn&rsquo;t use lucid dreaming, the terror was too overwhelming for thought, I just managed to wake myself up. I was awake for hours, even switching from bed to couch didn&rsquo;t send me back to sleep. I didn&rsquo;t want to take a Ramelteon (works on serotonin receptors and is non-addictive) or an Ativan (asked Onco to order me a couple for my MRI because of claustrophobia and now have a bottle of 120), so I was up from 2:00AM onwards.</p><p>Nightmares can&rsquo;t find me during the day. Naps are great. :)</p><p>So, she wants me to try neurofeedback - a kind of biofeedback. Biofeedback has always struck me as the wooiest woo, but I am old and now it&rsquo;s an evidence-based treatment. I&rsquo;ll give it a shot, but in the meantime my gabapentin dose gets a bump.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t believe that in these times, people want to censor talk about mortality, death, dying, and the process of disease, treatment, and so on. Skip the next paragraph if you&rsquo;re that extra.</p><p>I talked with her about The End. I said it was kind of comforting to have a general idea of what would kill me. I am okay with the concept of my mortality. It&rsquo;s not the end, but getting there that&rsquo;s the Big Scary. I&rsquo;ve seen that part of the trip. I&rsquo;ve prepared for it was much as possible, but in the end&hellip; well&hellip; we find out, don&rsquo;t we? Only 15 percent of people diagnosed with my type and stage of cancer come out the other end of chemo and radiation. Twenty people walk into a room and three will walk back out. I am deeply grateful to have had two-plus years of life when I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I would see my 56th birthday. It&rsquo;s been a lovely surprise.</p>
