Even more so if it’s on fresh bread. </p></blockquote><p>Also if you eat those little babybell cheese things, put some honey or fruit preserves on it to microdose on this same feeling. </p></blockquote><p>do this with white stilton and blueberries to unlock secret flavours and feelings</p></blockquote><p>I’ll keep that in mind the next time I’m in the cheese section </p></blockquote><p>If you have soft goat cheese or just cream cheese, try a creole influenced thing where you mix marmalade and horseradish in equal portions and put that over your block of cheese, serve with hot bread or toast or crackers and if ya nasty get a little wine</p></blockquote><p>You’re all falling for my trap and giving me even more wonderful new cheese ideas please never stop</p></blockquote><p>Great news! make cranberry jam. add brie. if you want to be extra fancy, make a nice crust, spread a little brie on it, then pile the jam on top. fancy pie. (i did this + orange whipped cream, it was amazing)</p></blockquote><p>I was a very sickly baby and an even sicklier toddler, which messed with my early food-weaning and meant I barely ate anything for years. But the one thing I would eat by the barrel was bananas, so my parents started trying to put bananas in other things to get me to eat more things.</p><p>So: bananas and cheese on toast. Sounds horrific, but try it. Strong cheddar, sliced bananas, whack em on toast under the grill. Surprisingly good </p></blockquote><p>Apple slices with toasted cheddar on them are also delic - I was introduced via apple pie and cheddar which was amazing but just fresh apples is a nice alternate.  For extra fun, toast the cheese with the creme brule torch</p><p><br/></p><p>There&rsquo;s also this Greek mozzarella and honey and phylo thing I had once that I have never found again that&rsquo;s divine</p></blockquote><p>a nice strong cheese and grapes</p></blockquote>
