Small milestones

<h1>Small milestones</h1><p>I have a lot of imaging stuff ahead - CT and MRI - but I was thinking yesterday about small milestones. I can do things now that I lost the ability to do after chemo/radiation/surgery. I am partially disabled and I can accept that now. From having an autoimmune disorder to the unimaginable it&rsquo;s-happening-to-me experience of cancer, I never comprehended how much I would lose, or at when I was at the very worst how much I would regain. </p><p>We&rsquo;re supposed to bounce back. We&rsquo;re supposed to emerge from cancer like a victorious warrior from battle. We emerge, we lucky few, but we don&rsquo;t come out unscarred, unscathed, or unchanged. The battle for our lives leaves us changed forever in ways we never calculated.</p><p>Small milestones. </p><ul><li>I can carry a load of 36 5oz cans of wet food, a 10lb sack of kibbles (Wellness and Acana because damn I have spoiled kitties), plus a 15lb bag of litter. I make it in two trips up the stairs, but I make it! </li><li>I can clean the bathtub. Before I couldn&rsquo;t really get in, get down, and scrub. Now I can.</li><li>Cooking was hard. There were times when I couldn&rsquo;t handle standing at the stove for ten minutes. Friday night I got the groceries delivered, put away, and prepped. Saturday, much cooking. Today, much in the freezer, ready for the next two weeks.</li><li>Getting heavy stuff moved. I was going to rearrange and toss a lot of stuff when I got sick, then I was so horrifyingly weak that my neighbors used to shadow me on the stairs. </li><li>Now I not only take out the trash, I can go up and down the stairs to the laundry room. Not easily. Slowly and carefully, but I can do it.</li><li>I got on the ladder today and changed a bulb. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a big thing, but when I was getting ready to start chemo, I bought the longest lasting bulbs I could. A friend fighting tonsil cancer (!) advised me. &ldquo;You will be too weak and dizzy to get up the ladder. Do as much as you can before you need it.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>These are little milestones. Yes. But they are milestones. The malign self-talk that uses the voice of my mother at her worst raves that nobody gives a shit, that only an idiot would take pleasure or pride in them.</p><p>I shut her up by saying, &ldquo;I do. And I am still alive to do them. I am still here and I can get better.&rdquo;</p><p>The voice shuts up.</p><p>There&rsquo;s great satisfaction in that.</p>
