Observations on bees

<h1>Observations on bees</h1><p>Sometimes, for reasons know only to bees, they collapse on my walkway. Most times, if I find them alive, I wet a swab with honey water and let them drink. If they&rsquo;re really out of it, I put them in a safe place. I have a mesh dish cover, put them on clean toweling, with a little honey-water station. Most times it&rsquo;s just a bee that got too far from home, or is suffering from heat or cold. I get the joy of setting them free and watching them fly away.</p><p>Other times, it&rsquo;s a bee kicked out of the colony. Old. It&rsquo;s time of year for it. She hung on to the swab weakly, and when she fell, I caught her in my hand to bring her inside. I set up the &lsquo;bee hospital.&rsquo; She ate and drank, but was so weak. She felt and tasted my pinky tip, buzzed her wings, and settled on the toweling. I figured she&rsquo;d rest and I&rsquo;d let her go in the morning. </p><p>Normally, when you find a dead bee, they&rsquo;ve curled up and died, thrashing in unknowable sensations. I went to look in on her and found her in what I think of as a sleeping bee position. Until I noticed her wings spread and unmoving in final flight. Sometimes, as hard as you fight, as hard as others fight for you, there is not one more day. I&rsquo;ve walked with my mortality for a couple of years now. Each day is one more gift, each day is powerful, what can you do, what would you do with one more day.</p><p>A little life, an almost invisible, and some would say an insignificant life. Still deserving of kindness, and a safe place to spread her wings in her final flight. It hit me hard, as things do.</p><p>Fly free, sister, to the Great Hive in the place of ever-blooming flowers, where it is always springtime, and you are always young and strong.</p>
