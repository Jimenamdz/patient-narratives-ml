We got 2/3rds of the largest unit moved over into the apartment! We decided eff it, we&rsquo;d bring the furniture in for the dining area and we&rsquo;ll just hold off on bringing the dining room table in until the plumbing job is done. But we have soooo much to go through and figure out what we&rsquo;re keeping and what we&rsquo;re donating and what we&rsquo;re trashing.</p><p>However, a friend has helped so much already and I don&rsquo;t want to ask for more help than necessary, but my mom has a $638 overdraft, and we need to come up with at least $1000 to cover rent, gas to go pay it and some more food. I&rsquo;m scraping the original goal and just setting it for $3000, to cover all that and the car repairs that still need to be done.</p><p>Any reblogs of this post, monetary help or buying things from our Amazon wishlist would be a huge help.. We&rsquo;re almost on our feet and hopefully we won&rsquo;t need as much help in the future. Thank you very much for reading, and have a pleasant day!</p><h1><b>TOTAL GOAL:</b> $600/$3000</h1></blockquote><p>Full disclosure: a friend of mine sent $2000 ($1000 to my account and $1000 to my mom&rsquo;s), and all of my mom&rsquo;s share went to her nearly $700 overdraft and to paying some bills and microloans. My share covered my $100 overdraft and went to a few microloans, food for dinner tonight since most of the food in our fridge is currently spoiled and gas for the car, plus melatonin and sachets since my drawers all smell horrible from being in storage. The $600 is what&rsquo;s left. I still need to come up with at least $600 to help with rent because I couldn&rsquo;t cover the payday loan payments of $300 each.</p></blockquote><p>My mom&rsquo;s bank is screwing around with charges and stuff so she&rsquo;s $675 overdrawn. Any help covering this would be a huge help.</p></blockquote>
