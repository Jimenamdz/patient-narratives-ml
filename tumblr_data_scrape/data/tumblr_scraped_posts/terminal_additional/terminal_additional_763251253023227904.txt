The Exit

<h1>The Exit</h1><p>Not now. Calm down.</p><p>Do I need to TW for a discussion of medically assisted suicide? Damned if I will censor myself for discussing it. Don&rsquo;t click the read-more if you&rsquo;re offended.</p><!-- more --><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about death (fuck cancer), how it comes, it&rsquo;s permutations. The first introduction I had to close-range mortality was of one of my middle school friends, hit by a car while walking to school. The driver was drunk and behind the wheel after going to a local bar that opened at 6:00AM. He had breakfast and three boilermakers, then got in his car. There was no goodbye, just a brutal and senseless excision of a 12-year-old girl from the fabric of the world. Snip. Gone. Energy dispersed. Closed coffin.</p><p>Between the AIDs epidemic, drugs and alcohol, physical disorders and disease, sepsis, misdiagnosis, suicide, I have had a lot of phone calls. If you live long enough, you know a lot of people who are not here any longer. This plays into a bit of news about the Sarco suicide pod, and I have thoughts.</p><p>We all will get there eventually. I do not blame people who are suffering and want to meet their end on their own terms. MAID is available in California, and I have discussed it with my oncologist. I am not there yet, but the possibility is that I will get to the point where I will be eligible and more to the point where I am ready. When I simply exist, when there is no joy in anything, and uncontrollable pain - that&rsquo;s my personal choice. </p><p>I have Big Issues with ideology, the way that euthanasia proponents push death like doctors push Ozempic, or pushed Oxycodone, and the way that it&rsquo;s turning into a class issue where the inability to afford long-term care or even hospice results in okey-dokey-artichokey, off you go. Medical aid in dying has turned into getting people off the books as I feared it would. My stepfather&rsquo;s hospice care 20 years ago was a circus of zealous glassy-eyed deathbots. My friends in the late 80s and early 90s suffering from HIV were cared for in the community, and if you have to die it sucks less with someone holding your hand, honoring your humanity with theirs. My mother was cared for by a religious hospice service, and they were wonderful. They followed the pre-need orders to the letter, and she died safe and as comfortable as possible.</p><p>The pod. </p><p>When ideology meets financing, that&rsquo;s not a slippery slope - it&rsquo;s a tightrope. The suicide pod on the surface is a win. You get in the pod, seal it, push a button, and off you go. I do not doubt that the woman who used it was suffering. Hypoxia is thought to be a painless way to die, but as with all endings, nobody knows what&rsquo;s happening in the dying person&rsquo;s perception. The pod costs $60K, is out of reach for anyone but the wealthy, or will cost one&rsquo;s life savings (of which the principals for the Sarco allegedly fleeced one woman previously) for those without the means. It&rsquo;s 3D printed, untested - unless you count the first user. </p><p>$60K. Cash.</p><p>I get that the American medical system is a clusterfuck and even at its best, there are still issues of access in addition to issues of race, class, and gender. The system alone can make you want to quit. I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed as female for decades, and even with a diagnosis in hand, you&rsquo;re still high-handed by those you&rsquo;re hiring to care for your body. In many cases you don&rsquo;t have a choice of doctor, or even the ability to see a doctor. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners are the gatekeeper class, doctors barely have fifteen minutes to spend with you. Minimums of care are not being met and I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that the 64-year-old woman was ill-served by her own medical providers and her family. It was hard to step back and let Mom&rsquo;s directives take over. You want to DO SOMETHING. Perhaps in their shoes, I would do the same, even drive Mom to the airport - though some states make that an offense as an accessory.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a difference between feeling bad because you&rsquo;re depressed and being depressed because you&rsquo;re feeling bad. That is a difference nobody has ever understood until I met my cancer team and pain doctor. The thing is, I don&rsquo;t want someone making their exit to do so for someone&rsquo;s profit margin any more than I want life-saving, life-changing treatment reduced to a line in an insurance company computer. Dying is the point where, as someone said, we cease to be biology and become physics. That is a profound change. It needs to be honored instead of commodified and doled out with ten-keys (do they use those any longer?) clicking in the background. Huckstering custom-printed push-button death is not a philosophy, or &lsquo;helping with a choice&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s murder for money.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry, Lady in the Forest, that it got to that point. I am glad that you went on terms of your own. I hope that you were not failed so drastically that your back was to the wall and this was your only way out. Be at peace.</p>
