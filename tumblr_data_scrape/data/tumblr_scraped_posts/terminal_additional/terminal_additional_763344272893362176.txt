WIP bit: Reckoning

<h1>WIP bit: Reckoning</h1><p>It gave him something to do. Kallus and Zeb left, Hera and Jacen looked about to go anywhere but Coruscant. Ezra collected retroactive combat pay and - in a move that unsettled him deeply - a bonus for his actions at Lothal. Not so much his actions, but his kill count. He tried to explain the last decade with Thrawn and failed miserably to bring anyone around to more than, &ldquo;Hurhurhur, blue man smart and bad.&rdquo;</p><p>One chucklehead publicly proposed invading the Ascendancy, but Chancellor Organa shut it down fast. She wanted him to meet with her brother, with other Jedi, but Ezra was hesitant. Everyone moved on, except him. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to go talk to Pyrondi.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t know he intended to say it. It just fell out of his mouth and stirred a thunderwasps&rsquo; nest. Oops. &ldquo;We go back a long way.&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;s tried to kill him, though they never met.</p><p>&ldquo;Ilyana Pyrondi will as soon shoot you as look at you - and that&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re lucky. She&rsquo;s one of Thrawn&rsquo;s proteges, part of the corps that left the Seventh with Faro minutes before the Purgill showed up.&rdquo; Hera didn&rsquo;t shout, exactly. She had to speak loudly over Chopper&rsquo;s cursing. &ldquo;Could you not get yourself killed within a month of getting back, Ezra?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to ask why she&rsquo;s the most classified person I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; Mothma kept her face smooth, a politician&rsquo;s mask. &ldquo;Since nobody here&rsquo;s handing out anything more than a runaround.&rdquo;</p><p>Chancellor Organa looked right at Mothma. &ldquo;Her file was sealed by the Senate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Chancellor has the authority to unseal it, right? No? Why? You&rsquo;re the Chancellor!&rdquo; Ezra threw up his hands, anger coming quickly. &ldquo;Why in the hell is everyone avoiding knowing the enemy? What the hell did the Senate do that they&rsquo;re so ashamed of that they don&rsquo;t want anyone to know for six centuries?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that simple. There has to be a quorum before I can unseal it - and I don&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra looked that word up and snorted. &ldquo;Then I want to ask Pyro herself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&hellip; may not be able to talk about it.&rdquo; The older man was a clone representative named Sevs and while Ezra might be a bonehead, he did have some empathy. &ldquo;The Senate could have ordered the survivors chipped.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The survivors of what? Why happened to turn her into someone who could talk a whole fleet into mass suicide?&rdquo; Ezra was alarmed when the man&rsquo;s hand went to his head. &ldquo;Ser Sevs? Are you all right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Genocide. It was genocide.&rdquo; Sevs gasped, eyes rolling and wide with agony, shoulder spasming. &ldquo;Gerrera did it. We covered it up. They ch-ch-ch-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get a kriffing medic! What the hell is wrong with you people?&rdquo; Ezra&rsquo;s heart sees Rex, Gregor, and Wollfe. He bolted out of his chair, reaching for the old man. &ldquo;Easy. I&rsquo;ve got you. I&rsquo;ll get the chip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Always&hellip; slaves&hellip; We are&hellip; always&hellip;slaves.&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra saw it in his heart, hooked into the body&rsquo;s neural net like a parasite. A guard reached for him, telling him to move away.</p><p>&ldquo;Touch me, touch him, and I will kill you. I&rsquo;ve killed so many that you&rsquo;ll just be one more.&rdquo; His hand rested over the chip and in the Force he started to unravel the web of pain and compulsion. </p><p>&ldquo;Touch him and I kill you.&rdquo; Hera. Bless Mom. &ldquo;Medics are on the way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;General Syndulla, it&rsquo;s not that easy.&rdquo; The Bothan guy. His signature in the Force was like greasy food that gave you a bellyache. &ldquo;There are nuances to consider, and consequences. Please believe that no harm is intended.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harm doesn&rsquo;t have to be intentional to happen. The term is &lsquo;collateral damage&rsquo; if I remember correctly.&rdquo;</p><p>There. That&rsquo;s it. Filaments only particles thick start retracting, withdrawing into the chip, Ezra fumbles to soothe the damage left behind. Sevs grips his arm, eyes wide in wonder.  </p><p>&ldquo;I want him in protective custody. Call my brother. I also want to know why a prohibited control device is implanted in an elected representative to the Senate - and how many others there are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chancellor Organa. Leia. Please-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Senator Mothma, if you and others want to start explaining, now&rsquo;s the time. Tell me things I don&rsquo;t know. Start with Senator Sevs.&rdquo;</p>
