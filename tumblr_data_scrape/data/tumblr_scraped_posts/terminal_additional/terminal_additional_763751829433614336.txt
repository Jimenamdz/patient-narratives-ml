<p>Everyone talks about how Jesus drove the money changers and merchants out of the temple, but everyone glosses over the fact that he took the time to braid a whip. That would have taken a couple hours. I have braided leather before, and it takes a lot of time and effort. It may have even taken more than one day, all scripture says is, â€œAnd when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple-â€œ there isnâ€™t a time period given. But I would still say it was at least a few hours. he had to braid multiple cords, bind them together, make a handle, and fix the cords to the handle.</p>
<p>The point of this is that what he did was NOT impulsive. It was cold and calculated. Premeditated even.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m sorry I know this is a really great insight but all I can think of is Jesus sitting there making His whip and the apostles shuffling around nervously wondering whoâ€™s about to get it</p>

<p>Honestly whatâ€™s going through my head is just.</p>
<p>Apostles: Youâ€™re back early<br/><br/>Jesus: Templeâ€™s infested.<br/><br/>Apostles: What?<br/><br/>Jesus - like three hours later - *cracks whip*: Templeâ€™s infested.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t just chasing people with a whip, it was chasing capitalists from a temple. Just saying. </p>

<p>An excellent point <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mZ1KnstP4mzC41biULGxzww" target="_blank">@maneth985</a> ! Christians who base their religious beliefs on the New Testament seem to vigorously â€˜forgetâ€™ that Jesus was unswervingly kind to the poor, the weak, the hungry and the stranger, while being totally unforgiving to those who exploit and demean their fellow humans. Smacking capitalists with a whip? Go for it dude!</p>
