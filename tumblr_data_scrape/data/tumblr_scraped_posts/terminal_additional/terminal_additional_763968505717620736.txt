The small joys

<h1>The small joys</h1><p>Moki (2 years, 18lbs) play-running very slowly from Dusty (15ys, 9lbs) as she chases him. </p><p>They&rsquo;ve been chasing and playing since I woke up this morning. It makes my heart squeeze a little. Dusty&rsquo;s going deaf, and has the early stages of dementia, but she adores her Big Kitten and he&rsquo;s so very gentle with her.</p>
