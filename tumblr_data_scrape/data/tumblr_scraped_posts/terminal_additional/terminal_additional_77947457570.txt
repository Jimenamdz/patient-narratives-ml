Prednisone

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been on it for a prolonged period, you&rsquo;ll understand. I FUCKING HATE IT!!!!! It&rsquo;s all I can do to not throw this laptop across the room right now. I&rsquo;ve been having one of the worst Prednisone days in months. And just to make it more fun, throw in some joint and bone pain.</p>
<p>And since taking it means my primary med is still working, there is an obvious incentive to remain on it indefinitely&hellip; Other than a short break in the spring last year, I&rsquo;ve now been on it for almost 18 months.Â But days like this? I&rsquo;m ready to call it quits. Feeling like a psychotic asshole isn&rsquo;t my idea of a good time.</p>
