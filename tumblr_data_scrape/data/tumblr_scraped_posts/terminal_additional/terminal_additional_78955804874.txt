When your thoughts are not your own

<p class="p1">We all have our “moments” when the mind goes blank or we say to ourselves “what the hell was I thinking?..” Those are just the everyday occurrences in our world of multitasking, non-stop stimulation, and too much stress. Before cancer, I would never let those moments cause much concern. </p>
<p class="p2">But now? It concerns me a lot. It seems that every step along the treatment path has a cost in terms of mental acuity and clarity. Or in other words, I feel like I’m slowly losing my mind. </p>
<p class="p2">In the first meeting with Deepak, my Oncologist, he focused in on what I did for a living. Lots of questions about decision making, critical thinking, stuff like that. He explained that hormone (Testosterone) suppression would have a significant impact on the part of my brain that handles executive functioning. He was pretty blunt that it might not be possible to mentally function at the high level required by my job. It was bad enough that in the same meeting we were also talking about my limited life expectancy but to hear that the treatments would mess with my brain? Shit… </p>
<p class="p2">Of course there were several other nasty side effects to consider but that one really got my attention. In a classic denial response, the idea that I might not be able to do my job was almost more of a concern than being told to get my affairs in order… But it was the first line treatment and hopefully the best (no way I could wrap my head around chemo at that point) way to slow do the progression of the disease. So I brushed aside his predictions of functional demise and forged on. </p>
<p class="p2">I made it for almost three years before accepting reality and throwing in the towel on my career. The slow erosion of those mental skills that made me so good at what I did spiked as I went through chemo. I was falling further and further behind and having a difficult time keeping all the balls in the air. In academia there is a time honored tradition of people staying way past their expiration date… I decided to not be one of them and closed out things as gracefully and quickly as possible. </p>
<p class="p2">Fast forward to now, almost a year later and the erosion process hasn’t slowed down. There have been more drugs added to my cocktail and the cumulative effects of that, chemo brain, and time, has reduced me to a shadow (or so I feel) or my former self. </p>
<p class="p2">Friends tell me they don’t see any difference on the outside but then again, they are friends… I wouldn’t expect them to be honest, why make me feel even worse? Pretty sure I’m not imagining this. </p>
<p class="p2">Even the effort to write things like this almost makes me break out in a sweat. It is so difficult to organize the thoughts. Writing was a big part of what I did, I was really good at it. Now it feels like a form of mental torture. It takes so much effort to write anything resembling an articulate thought. </p>
<p class="p2">And then the title of this, “when your thoughts are not your own.” It’s a daily occurrence. I find myself thinking or saying things that are not at all what I mean or believe. Prednisone makes me angry and manic, Gabapentin makes things foggy, Lupron makes me endlessly indecisive, Zytiga, shit.. I don’t know what the hell that’s doing. And chemo brain seems stronger than ever almost a year later. Sometimes I stop dead in my tracks and listen in disbelief to what is happening inside my head. It makes me feel like I’m not “me” anymore. </p>
