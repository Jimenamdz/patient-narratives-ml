Part 2: When your thoughts are not your own

<p>I was so focused on the pharmacologically induced aspect of this that I totally spaced out on the other side of the coin&ndash;the emotional impact of incurable cancer. I honestly don&rsquo;t know which has more of an effect and suppose it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, it&rsquo;s a package deal&hellip; But the stress, fear, and depression that come along with what was essentially a terminal diagnosis are all part of the equation. They all mess with your head&hellip; </p>
<p>PTSD is often sited in the literature as an issue for cancer survivors. But I don&rsquo;t run across as many references regarding its impact on stage IV patients. I have no doubt that it plays a role, just hang out with me on lab work days&hellip; </p>
<p>My motive for writing about this isn&rsquo;t to elicit a &ldquo;poor Greg&rdquo; response. It&rsquo;s just another way for me to try and rationalize and externalize what&rsquo;s happening. I&rsquo;ve always been someone who spent too much time living inside my own head and now that&rsquo;s not a very healthy place to be. It&rsquo;s also a lot to unload on your friends in face to face conversations. So I put it down in written words that anyone can take or leave. Including me.</p>
<p>And just to be clear, cancer hasn&rsquo;t turned me into some sort of &ldquo;voices in my head&rdquo; whack-job. Call this my version of talk therapy. It&rsquo;s just a lot of shit to deal with.  </p>
