Disconnected from reality

<p>Please indulge a short rant&hellip; So yesterday we had a glorious sunny day with temps in the low 50&rsquo;s. I took off on a long walk knowing I&rsquo;d be house-bound for a couple days since we&rsquo;re having a blizzard today&hellip; Supposed to get up to 18&quot; of snow&hellip; But that&rsquo;s not what I want to rant about!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m walking down one of our neighborhood streets and there are some enormous puddles because the snow was melting like crazy. Some of them spanned the whole street from one side to the other. As I approached one of these small ponds&hellip; a car was heading towards me. I moved off to the side as far from the water as I could get, fully expecting the car to slow down. I&rsquo;m looking directly at the driver and she never even registered the water, hitting it at full-speed. A tsunami of muddy water washes over me&hellip; We&rsquo;re talking soaked from head to toe. I turn to yell and obscenely gesture, expecting the car to have slowed down, and it&rsquo;s speeding off as if nothing happened!</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m standing there trying to squeegee the water and mud off of myself, wait for it&hellip; another car comes zooming along. SPLASH!!! Good thing I was on the back side of my morning Prednisone dose or I would have turned into a psychotic maniac&hellip; But this time the driver stopped and apologized, even offering me some paper towels.</p>
<p>But it just blows me away that people can be so disconnected (distracted) from their surroundings. Â How could you not see what was going to happen?.. Sigh&hellip;</p>
<p>The rest of the walk was uneventful!!</p>
