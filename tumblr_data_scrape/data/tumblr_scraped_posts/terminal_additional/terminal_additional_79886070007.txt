Labs

<p>In addition to the usual suite of monthly labs, a few more were added this time around. This morning they took so many tubes that my arm was going numb! The results were a mixed bag. My primary marker moved up again along with some other important CMP numbers. Trying to keep the words of my Oncology NP front and center&hellip; She said they (the numbers) are going to move around and that I have to expect things like this to happen. She also told me to NOT FREAK OUT!!! Trying&hellip; </p>
<p>But my lipid profile was quite good so at least all the drugs haven&rsquo;t screwed that up.</p>
<p>The reason labs have become so stressful is the length of time (approaching a year) I&rsquo;ve been on Zytiga. That&rsquo;s the drug that is keeping things under control right now. It&rsquo;s a given that eventually the cancer will mutate and circumvent it, and then I will be down to one last androgen suppression drug to try. After that, it&rsquo;s back to chemo. Zytiga is so new that there isn&rsquo;t a lot of long term usage data. Initially they told me it could work anywhere from a few months to two or three years. But with such aggressive disease, I&rsquo;ve burned through other drugs at an alarming rate. So of course, any upward movement makes we worry that it&rsquo;s about to stop working. </p>
<p>Fear. It&rsquo;s about the future. Right now, I am ok. Just need to keep focused on what&rsquo;s in front of me, right here, right now. Tomorrow I&rsquo;m getting on a plane and heading to Florida. Time for a much needed escape and time with friends.</p>
