The joy of air travel...

<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting on the plane in SRQ, boarding is complete, we&rsquo;re ready to push back from the gate and then there is a commotion up front&hellip; The life raft/emergency slide for the front door has just deployed itself into the cabin! I shit you not&hellip;</p>
<p>The pilots are trapped in the cockpit and the flight attendants have no way to deflate this thing. Luckily none of them were standing there when it let fly, I&rsquo;m sure it would have caused some serious injuries.</p>
<p>We had to wait for a maintenance mechanic to arrive that could deflate it so everyone could get off because now the plane is no longer flight worthy&hellip;</p>
<p>A packed flight (I think ~ 160 people) now need to be rebooked and guess what, it&rsquo;s the end of spring break and all flights are full&hellip; I was looking at Monday or Tuesday before I could get out. Normally I would have been like &ldquo;cool! back to Steven&rsquo;s house!&rdquo; but Monday is an Oncology exam along with Lupron and I didn&rsquo;t want to try and reschedule all that. A little quick thinking on my feet along with the Delta app on my phone got me on a flight tomorrow morning out of Tampa. With a taxi voucher in hand (mind you, it was an hour and a half cab ride&hellip;), I headed to my Aunt and Uncle&rsquo;s for the night. What a day&hellip;</p>
<p>Â Keeping my fingers crossed for a little smoother trip in the morning!!</p>
